States Supreme Court\nAIKINS v. KINGSBURY(1918)\nNo. 265\nArgued: Decided: June 10, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 484, 485]\n\u00a0\n Mr. R. P. Henshall, of San Francisco, Cal., for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On June 3, 1869, the state of California sold to Charles A. B. Brackett three hundred and twenty acres of school land, and delivered to him a 'certificate of purchase' for it. Twenty per cent. of the purchase money was payable at the time of the purchase and the remainder 'within one year after the passage of any act of the Legislature requiring such payment, or before, if desired by the purchaser.'\n The unpaid purchase money was to bear interest at the rate of ten per cent. per annum, payable in advance.\n The purchaser paid interest to January 1, 1873, and nothing further for thirty-eight years, when, on October 26, \n\n[247 U.S. 484, 486]\n\u00a0\n 1911, a state official, without authority to waive the default, accepted the amount of the unpaid purchase money and interest from the plaintiff in error, as transferee of the certificate, who thereupon demanded a patent for the land, which was refused for the reason that on December 29, 1886, a certificate of purchase for the same land had been issued by the state to Michael Phillips, on which the principal and interest was paid in full on August 28, 1911\n\n\n Upon this refusal by the state, the plaintiff in error filed the petition in this case 'for a writ of mandate' to compel the defendant in error, as Commissioner of the Land Office of the state to prepare a patent for the land in controversy and to send the same to the Governor of the state, together with a certificate that the laws had been complied with, and that he as transferee of Charles A. B. Brackett was entitled thereto. Such a suit is said by the Supreme Court of California to be 'in effect an action to require specific performance on the part of the state' of the contract evidenced by the certificate of purchase.\n A judgment of the superior court granting the prayer of the petition was affirmed by the District Court of Appeals, and this in turn was reversed by the decision of the Supreme Court of the state which is now before us for review.\n In 1889 (St. 1889, p. 428) the Legislature of California passed an act providing that in all cases in which a certificate of purchase of public land had been issued prior to March 27, 1872, on which arrears of principal and interest had remained due and unpaid for five years, and in which, prior to the passage of the act, the state had issued to a subsequent purchaser another certificate for the same land, the owner of the first issued certificate should be deemed to have lost the right to the land or to complete the contract for the purchase of it, unless he should pay all unpaid interest within six months from the passage of the act. \n\n[247 U.S. 484, 487]\n\u00a0\n If this act is a valid law it is obvious that it cut off the plaintiff in error's transferror from all interest in the land in controversy, for the Brackett certificate was issued prior to March 27, 1872, interest on it had been due and unpaid for sixteen years, and another certificate had been issued to Phillips, when the act was passed, and nothing further was paid until 1911.\n But the plaintiff in error claims that this act of 1889 is invalid because it impairs the obligation of his contract of 1869 and deprives him of his property without due process of law.\n These are large claims, made in impressive terms, but in reality the only obligations of this simple contract were, that the state on the one hand, should furnish a patent to the land when it should be paid for at the times and in the manner stipulated, and that the purchaser, on the other hand, should make payment as he had agreed to make it.\n For the enforcement of the contract the law gave to the state a remedy by foreclosure, in a court proceeding, for default of the purchaser, and to the purchaser or his assigns was given the privilege to redeem at any time before the e piration of twenty days from entry of judgment of foreclosure against him.\n And now, after having neglected, if not repudiated, his obligation under the contract, by failing to pay the interest due upon it for 16 years before the act was passed and for 22 years thereafter, the plaintiff in error comes complaining that the state by the act of 1889 impaired his right under it by taking away the twenty-day period of redemption, which the prior law allowed, even though a six months' period of redemption, from the passage of the act, was substituted for it.\n It is sufficient answer to this contention to say that:\n The right of the state to foreclose such a contract for default in payment, and the right of the purchaser to \n\n[247 U.S. 484, 488]\n\u00a0\n redeem after a default decree, relate to the remedy as distinguished from the obligation of the contract, and both of these rights are constitutionally subject to modification by the state, within limits which were not exceeded in the act before us, as is decided in Wilson v. Standefer, \n184 U.S. 399\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 384, and in Waggoner v. Flack, \n188 U.S. 595\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 345, which are strikingly similar in their facts and in their applicable law to the case we are considering. The right of the purchaser to redeem under the prior law was limited to paying before the expiration of twenty days from entry of default 'the amount due the state and the costs of suit' and this right was modified by the act of 1889 so as to permit redemption by 'paying the interest remaining unpaid for such purchase within six months from and after the passage of this act.' The notice to defendants in a suit for default under the prior law was of such a summary character that we cannot doubt that the privilege of the purchaser to redeem under the act of 1889 is as liberal as it was before the act was passed and the change, therefore, did not deprive him of any substantial right or benefit.\n It is, however, pressed upon our attention as an important difference between the Texas act involved in these cited cases and the California act before us, that the former, in terma, gives to the purchaser of public land the privilege for six months after a decree of forfeiture has been entered against him, by a designated state officer, of resorting to a court proceeding to set aside such default on the ground that it was not authorized, while no such provision is contained in the latter. It is asserted that this distinguishes the two acts, and that the absence of authority for such a court proceeding renders the California act invalid, by depriving the plaintiff in error of his property without due process of law.\n It would be sufficient reply to this to say that the right to redeem after default decreed, which the purchaser had \n\n[247 U.S. 484, 489]\n\u00a0\n under the California statute when his contract was made, was limited to payment of 'the amount due the state and costs of suit,' and that, therefore, the act of 1889 did not deprive him of such a privilege as the Tesas act him of such a privilege as the Texas act proceeding on the ground that it was not authorized.\n But it is not important for us to consider such a question, for it is not presented in the record before us. The plaintiff in error comes admitting that for thirty-eitht years he and the persons through whom he claims were in default, and, since he does not offer any excuse for such abandonment of the contract, even if the California act had contained the provision of the Texas act allowing a court review of the default defined in it, such remedy could not have been of any avail to the plaintiff in error for he makes no case upon which he could possibly have made use of it, and he is, therefore, not in any position to attack the constitutionality of the act involved for an omission which does not injure him, and which, if supplied, would not benefit him. He who would successfully assail a law as unconstitutional must come showing that the feature of the act complained of operates to deprive him of some constitutional right. Tyl r v.

U S(1918)\nNo. 212\nArgued: November 4, 1918Decided: December 9, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 78, 81]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. H. Hanford, of Seattle, Wash., for appellant.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Brown, for the United States.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 78, 86]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the United States to enjoin the Alaska Pacific Fisheries, a California corporation, from maintaining, and to compel it to remove, an extensive fish trap erected by it in navigable waters at the Annette ISLANDS IN ALASKA. THE OBJECTIONS URGEd Against thE trap are, first, that it is within a reservation lawfully established for the use of the Metlakahtla and other Indians, and, second, that it is an unauthorized obstruction to the navigable capacity of waters of the United States. A decree was entered granting the relief sought and this was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 240 Fed. 274, 153 C. C. A. 200.\n The Annette Islands are a group of small islands in southeastern Alaska. During the summer of 1887 some 800 Metlakahtla Indians emigrated from British Columbia and settled on one of these islands. The emigration and settlement were not only acquiesced in but encouraged by executive and administrative officers of the United States,1 and subsequently were sanctioned by Congress through the enactment of section 15 of the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26 Stat. 1101 (Comp. St. 1916,  5096a). That section reads as follows:\n'That until otherwise provided by law the body of lands known as Annette Islands, situated in Alexander Archipelago in southeastern Alaska, on the north side of Dixon's entrance, be, and the same is hereby, set apart as a reservation for the use of the Metlakahtla Indians, and those people known as Metlakahtlans who have recently emigrated from British Columbia to Alaska, and such \n\n[248 U.S. 78, 87]\n\u00a0\n other Alaskan natives as may join them, to be held and used by them in common, under such rules and regulations, and subject to such restrictions, as may [be] prescribed from time to time by the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n The fish trap was erected in 1916 without the consent of the Indians or the Secretary of the Interior. It is a formidable structure consisting of heavy piling and wire webbing, is located in water of considerable depth approximately 600 feet from the high tide line of the island on which the Indians settled, is intended to catch about 600,000 salmon in a single season, and its operation will tend materially to reduce the natural supply of fish accessible to the Indians.\n The principal question for decision is whether the reservation created by the Act of 1891 embraces only the upland of the islands or includes as well the adjacent waters and submerged land. The question is one of construction-of determining what Congress intended by the words 'the body of lands known as Annette Islands.'\n As an appreciation of the circumstances in which words are used usually is conducive and at times is essential to a right understanding of them, it is important, in approaching a solution of the question stated, to have in mind the circumstances in which the reservation was created-the power of Congress in the premises, the location and character of the islands, the situation and needs of the Indians and the object to be attained.\n That Congress had power to make the reservation inclusive of the adjacent waters and submerged land as well as the upland needs little more than statement. All were the property of the United States and within a district where the entire dominion and sovereignty rested in the United States and over which Congress had complete legislative authority. National Bank v. County of Yankton, \n101 U.S. 129\n, 133; Shively v. Bowlby, 152 \n\n[248 U.S. 78, 88]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 1, 47-48, 58, 14 Sup. Ct. 548; United States v. Winans, \n198 \nU.S. 371, 383\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 662. The reservation was not in the nature of a private grant, but simply a setting apart, 'until otherwise provided by law,' of designated public property for a recognized public purpose-that of safe-guarding and advancing a dependent Indian people dwelling within the United States. See United States v. Kagama, \n118 U.S. 375\n, 379, et seq., 6 Sup. Ct. 1109; United States v. Rickert, \n188 \nU.S. 432, 437\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 478.\n The islands are in the interior of the Alexander Archipelago and separated from other islands by well-known bodies of water. Before the Metlakahtla settlement they were wild and uninhabited. While bearing a fair supply of timber, only a small portion of the upland is arable, more than three-fourths consisting of mountains and rocks. Salmon and other fish in large numbers frequent and pass through the waters adjacent to the shore and the opportunity thus afforded for securing fish for local consumption and for salting, curing, canning and sale gives to the islands a value for settlement and inhabitance which otherwise they would not have.\n The purpose of the Metlakahtlans in going to the islands was to establish an Indian colony which would be self-sustaining and reasonably free from the obstacles which attend the advancement of a primitive people. They were largely fishermen and hunters, accustomed to live from the returns of those vocations, and looked upon the islands as a suitable location for their colony, because the fishery adjacent to the shore would afford a primary means of subsistence and a promising opportunity for industrial and commercial development.\n After their settlement and before the reservation was created, the Indians, under the guidance of a noted missionary, adopted a form of self- government suited to their needs; established for themselves a village with substantial dwellings, schoolhouses and the like, and \n\n[248 U.S. 78, 89]\n\u00a0\n constructed and installed an extensive establishment where they canned salmon for the market. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The purpose of creating the reservation was to encourage, assist and protect the Indians in their effort to train themselves to habits of industry, become self-sustaining and advance to the ways of civilized life. True, the Metlakahtlans were foreign born, but the action of Congress has made that immaterial here.\n The circumstances which we have recited shed much light on what Congress intended by 'the body of lands known as Annette Islands.' The Indians could not sustain themselves from the use of the upland alone. The use of the adjacent fishing grounds was equally essential. Without this the colony could not prosper in that location. The Indians naturally looked on the fishing grounds as part of the islands and proceeded on that theory in soliciting the reservation. They had done much for themselves and were striving to do more. Evidently Congress intended to conform its action to their situation and needs. It did not reserve merely the site of their village, or the island on which they were dwelling, but the whole of what is known as Annette Islands, and referred to it as a single body of lands. This, as we think, shows that the geographical name was used, as is sometimes done, in a sense embracing the intervening and surrounding waters as well as the upland-in other words, as descriptive of the area comprising the islands.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 78, 3]\n\u00a0\n This conclusion has support in the general rule that statutes passed for the benefit of dependent Indian tribes or communities are to be liberally construed, doubtful expressions being resolved in favor of the Indians. Choate v. Trapp, \n224 \nU.S. 665, 675\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 565, and cases cited. And it has further support in the facts that, save for the de fendant's- \n\n[248 U.S. 78, 90]\n\u00a0\n conduct in 1916, the statute from the time of its enactment has been treated, as stated in the opinion of the Alaska court, by the Indians and the public as reserving the adjacent fishing grounds as well as the upland, and that in regulations prescribed bybthe Secretary of the Interior on February 9, 1915, the Indians are recognized prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior on issued for erecting salmon traps at these islands.\n These views are decisive of the suit and sustain the decree below.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] House Ex.

Napier, of San Antonio, Tex., for petitioners. \n\n[247 U.S. 240, 241]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph W. Bailey, of Dallas, Tex., and William D. Gordon, of Beaumont, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover 1,280 acres of land in San Patricio County, Texas. There was a trial by jury in which the Court directed a verdict for the plaintiff as to all but certain excepted portions not in controversy here. Exceptions were saved by the defendants, the petitioners, to their not being allowed to go to the jury on the question whether they had a good defence under the Texas statutes of limitation, but they were overruled and the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. A petition for certiorari was allowed on the suggestion that there was a manifest conflict between the ruling and the decisions of the State Court.\n An Act of July 22, 1870 (Sp. Acts 12th Leg. c. 19), declared that a land certificate for 1,280 acres theretofore issued to General Sam Houston for military services was a 'just claim from its original date' and authorized the issue of a 'patent on the same, in the name of the heirs of General Sam Houston, deceased.' General Houston's will gave discretionary power to his executors to make such disposition of his personal and real estate as might seem to them best for the interests of his family. n July 22, 1871, Houston's surviving executor made an instrument purporting to convey the above mentioned land warrant and the interest of Houston's estate and heirs to Colman, Mathis and Fulton. On December 30, 1872, the warrant was located on land already occupied by those grantees, and the executor's conveyance to them was recorded on July 17, 1873. The defendants held deeds under the successors of Colman, Mathis and Fulton. A patent was issued 'to the heirs of Sam Houston, deceased,' on June \n\n[247 U.S. 240, 242]\n\u00a0\n 22, 1874. The plaintiff derived its title from these heirs under deeds executed in 1914\n\n\n A plausible argument can be made that the working of the Act of 1870 and other pertinent facts and statutes which we do not recite was to give to the land warrant the validity and effect that it would have had if lawfully executed in General Houston's life. But as that is not the ground upon which the writ of certiorari was asked or granted we confine our discussion to the matter relied upon in asking the intervention of this Court. Hubbard v. Tod, \n171 \nU.S. 474, 494\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 14. The defendants alleged that if the deeds did not give them a good title, still they had held peaceable and adverse possession of the land, using and enjoying the same, paying taxes thereon, and claiming under deeds duly registered, for more than five years, and therefore that this suit was too late under Rev. Stat. Texas, art. 5674. They contended that the fact appeared as matter of law, and also that at least the jury might find for them and sufficiently saved the question as against the view taken by the Court below.\n There was evidence that the land in question was part of a large pasture fenced on the north along the Chiltipin Creek and on the east and west by fences running from the creek to deep water in Nueces Bay. There was evidence also that the defendants or their predecessors had paid the taxes, had pastured their cattle there, and excluded those of others, and that they claimed under duly registered deeds. The ground in which the Court ruled as it did and refused requests of the petitioners was stated by it to be that the water front on Nueces Bay was not 'such a barrier as would put in motion the statutes of limitation.' This ruling was in deference to Hyde v. McFaddin, 140 Fed. 433, 442, 72 C. C. A. 655. But that case was decided on peculiar circumstances, and we do not think an extensive citation from the Texas decisions necessary to show that when the other elements of ad- \n\n[247 U.S. 240, 243]\n\u00a0\n verse occupation are present, deep water upon one side of a parallelogram is as good a barrier as a fence. Evidently that is the law in Texas as well as elsewhere, and an enclosure by fences and the Nueces River has been said to sustain the defence of the statute as well as fences all around. Dunn v. Taylor (Tex. Civ. App.) 107 S. W. 952, 956; Id., 102 Tex. 80, 87, 113 S. W. 265. The arguments of the respondent on this point at the most do no more than offer considerations of fact that possibly it might be entitled to present to the jury when the case next is tried.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nANDREWS v. JOHN NIX & CO.(1918)\nNo. 140\nArgued: January 22, 1918Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. Samuel H. Richards and Thomas E. French, both of Camden, N. J ., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[246 U.S. 273, 274]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry F. Stockwell and Edwin G. C. Bleakly, both of Camden, N. J., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases presenting the same question for decision, were argued and will be decided together.\n On February 3, 1910, the defendant in error, John Nix & Co., and two other creditors, filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against Benajah D. Andrews. On the 15th day of the same month Andrews died and the plaintiff in error was duly appointed executrix of his will. On the 4th of the following April the estate of Andrews was adjudicated bankrupt by the District Court and on the 28th day of the same month a trustee was appointed. Each of the defendants in error, promptly made proof of a claim against the bankrupt estate, and both claims were forthwith allowed.\n On February 13, 1914, almost four years after these claims were allowed, on the application of Nix & Co. and of Hendrickson, the District Court ordered that the claim of each of them 'be wholly withdrawn from said bankruptcy proceeding and expunged from the list of claims upon the record in this case and excluded from participating in the distribution of the estate ... of the b nkrupt.' After the entry of this order a dividend was declared and paid by the trustee, in which Nix & Co. and Hendrickson did not participate. No order for the discharge of the bankrupt estate was applied for or granted.\n At the time of his death Andrews owned two policies of insurance upon his life, one payable to his estate and the other payable to his executors, administrators, and assigns. The proceeds of these two policies, less loans secured by them and less their surrender value, which was paid to the trustee in bankruptcy, were paid to the \n\n[246 U.S. 273, 275]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff in error as executrix, and the money is held by her subject to the decision of this case.\n The defendants in error instituted suits in the Supreme Court of the state of New Jersey to recover judgments on the same claims which had been allowed by the trustee but were subsequently withdrawn. The cases were submitted to the court upon a stipulation as to the essential facts substantially as we have stated them, and each recovered a judgment which was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals of the state of New Jersey, which judgments are before us for review.\n The case is in very narrow compass and calls upon us to consider the proviso of subdivision 5 of section 70a of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 (Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 565 [Comp. St. 1916,  9654]) and to decide whether the defendants in error 'participated in the distribution' of the bankrupt's estate under the bankruptcy proceedings, within the meaning of that proviso, which reads as follows:\n'Provided, that when any bankrupt shall have any insurance policy which has a cash surrender value payable to himself, his estate, or personal representative, he may, within thirty days after the cash surrender value has been ascertained and stated to the trustee by the company issuing the same, pay or secure to the trustee the sum so ascertained and stated, and continue to hold, own, and carry such policy free from the claims of the creditors participating in the distribution of his estate under the bankruptcy proceedings, otherwise the policy shall pass to the trustee as assets.'\n\n The argument of the plaintiff in error is that these defendants are brought within the purpose, if not within the express terms, of this statutory proviso and should not recover, for the reason that they participated in the election of the trustee in bankruptcy, proved their claims, and were represented in the meeting of creditors at which important action was taken involving expense to the bankrupt estate. \n\n[246 U.S. 273, 276]\n\u00a0\n Unfortunately for the validity of this argument the provision of the statute is not that the proceeds of the insurance policies may be held 'free from the claims' of creditors who participated in the bankruptcy proceedings, but only from the claims of creditors 'participating in the distribution of the estate in the bankruptcy proceedings.'\n Whether a line of discrimination between such two classes of creditors is wise or logical is not for us to decide. It is enough that it lies plainly obvious upon the face of the statute. No dividend was paid creditors until after the defendants in error by order of the court had been excluded from participation in the distribution of the estate, and it is stipulated in the agreed case that no payment was made to either of them. The meaning of the proviso is too plain for discussion or interpretation and that the defendants in error did not 'participate in the distribution of the estate in the bankruptcy proceedings' is clear. The judgment of the Court of Errors and Appeals of the state of New Jersey must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nANICKER v.

Rosser, of Tulsa, Okl., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a contest between holders of oil and gas leases made by one Eastman Richard, a full-blood Creek Indian, the owner by patent of the west half of the northeast quarter of section 5 of township 17 N., range 7 E., in Creek County, Oklahoma. Richard made a lease of the west one-half of the quarter to David Gunsburg and the Southwestern Petroleum Company on March 20, 1912. This lease was not filed for record with the Indian Agency until April 5, 1912, nor was it recorded with the Register of Deeds for Creek County, Oklahoma. On March 28, 1912, Richards made a like lease for the same premises to the appellant, William J. Anicker, which was filed with the Indian Agency on March 30, 1912, and on April 1, 1912, was filed for record with the Register of \n\n[246 U.S. 110, 114]\n\u00a0\n Deeds for Creek County, Oklahoma. It thus appears that the lease to Gunsburg and the Southwestern Petroleum Company was earlier than the one to Anicker but the latter was first recorded. Upon hearing upon these conflicting leases the United States Indian Superintendent recommended the approval of the Gunsburg and Southwestern Petroleum Company lease.\n After referring to the dates of the leases and the time of filing the same for record, the superintendent said:\n'The Department has uniformly held in such cases that where a lease is filed, with the papers necessary for completion of same, within thirty days, that the date of execution is the date from which the priority of the lease is determined.\n\n'To my mind this is the only reasonable construction of the regulations, so long as thirty days or any other period is allowed within which to file a lease. But it is contended on behalf of Mr. Anicker that the lease to Gunsburg and the Southwestern Petroleum Company was obtained by fraud. To this contention I cannot agree for the reason that this lease and the lease to Messrs. Funk & Riter were presented to this office on the date of execution, fully explained by Mr. William Kremer, Asst. Chief Clerk, a notary in this office, and acknowledged by the lessor. This contention the attorneys for Mr. Anicker were unable to support in their cross-examination of Eastman Richard, although it was apparent at that time that the lessor did not remember the names of the lessees. He was however, confident that he had leased his entire allotment at that time, and it appears from Mr. Kremer's testimony, May 14, 1912, page 23, that the lease was fully explained to the lessor, as is done in all cases where leases are acknowledged before a notary in the employ of this office, and considering the numerous declarations and affidavits submitted bearing the lessor's signature in connection with this case, showing a change of attitude \n\n[246 U.S. 110, 115]\n\u00a0\n upon every occasion approached in connection with these leases, and his lack of business ability, I am not inclined to entertain any doubt as to the fact that the lease was fully explained to him upon the date of execution thereof, notwithstanding his uncertainty at the hearing on May 13th and 14th as to the name of the lessee.\n\n'It is further contended, in behalf of Mr. Anicker, that he should be considered prior lessee for the reason that his lease was made prior to the time the lease of Gunsburg and the Southwestern Petroleum Company was filed at the Union Agency or elsewhere, and that the same was not only filed in the county wherein the land is situate, but also filed at Union Agency at a date prior to the date upon which the lease to Gunsburg and the Southwestern Petroleum Company was received.\n\n'It is also contended that he had no actual notice, and an attempt has been made to show that the lessor had conveyed the idea to Mr. Anicker or his agent that the only lease he had executed when approached by Mr. Anicker, was the lease in favor of the Eastern Oil Company. It will be noted in the testimony that an unsuccessful effort was made to secure an admission from Eastman Richard that would corroborate this contention.\n\n'For the purposes of this case I do not consider it necessary to determine at this time whether or not the evidence at hand shows that such representations were made by the lessor; even admitting that the lessee was misled by the lessor, the regulations which provide thirty days within which a lease may be filed, if binding upon parties interested in securing leases, should be considered as heretofore, as giving that lease priority which bears the prior date of execution and is filed with the papers required, within the 30-day period.\n\n'An examination of the lease to David Gunsburg and the Southwestern Petroleum Company discloses the fact that this lease was filed within thirty days, in accordance \n\n[246 U.S. 110, 116]\n\u00a0\n with the regulations, and that the same was executed prior to the lease in favor of Mr. Anicker. Concerning the contention of Mr. Anicker that the date of filing should be regarded as the date of priority, which carries with it the contention that the regulations of the Secretary of the Interior allowing thirty days within which to fild a lease is not within the power conferred on the Secretary of the Interior, under the law, which provides in part (section 2, Act of Congress of May 27, 1908 [35 Stat. L. 312]): 'That leases of restricted lands for oil and gas mining purposes ... may be made with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior under rules and regulations provided by the Secretary of the Interior and not otherwise.\"\n\n After upholding the right of the Secretary of the Interior to make rules and regulations the superintendent further said:\n'The Secretary clearly having the right to fix a reasonable period within which time lessees may and must file their leases for approval, it follows that if such a regulation is made all lessees must receive the same treatment, both as to the benefits or privileges of taking the time allowed, or on the contrary the penalty, if they fail to comply with the regulation. If this policy was not followed, the rule might as well be abolished, but this would lead to many opportunities of double dealing on behalf of both lessees and lessors. It being almost a physical impossibility to execute, complete the papers and file leases simultaneously, a reasonable time must be given. The thirty-day rule has been in effect since the early days of oil lease development in the Five Tribes nd persons taking leases almost universally understand that the date of the lease, if filed within the thirty-day period, governs, instead of the date of filing.\n\n ...\n'The lease of Mr. Anicker must also be disapproved \n\n[246 U.S. 110, 117]\n\u00a0\n not because he was in any way delinquent himself, but because of the prior lease of David Gunsburg and the Southwestern Petroleum Company filed with all papers required within even a shorter period than that allowed by the Department.'\n\n The superintendent concluded that the lease in favor of Anicker should be disapproved, and the lease to Gunsburg and Southwestern Petroleum Company should be approved.\n Upon hearing before the First Assistant Secretary of the Interior that officer reached a like conclusion. A motion to reconsider was denied, the Secretary concluding:\n'If there were any advantage in the prior filing of a lease which was entered into and executed after another lease, both having been filed at the agency within the time required by regulation, Anicker would have had that advantage. The Act of March 1, 1907 (34 Stat. 1026), makes the filing at Union Agency legal notice. Anicker's lease is stamped as filed at the Agency March 30, 1912. Until approved by the Secretary, it was not a completed instrument and the fact of its having been recorded in a county office cannot estop the Secretary from finding that another lease regularly executed and filed is more for the allottee's interest and better entitled to approval.'\n\n The plaintiff's bill was filed upon the theory that the lease to Gunsburg and Southwestern Petroleum Company had been approved by the Secretary by mistake of law, and that, but for the mistake, the lease of plaintiff in error would have been approved, and the bill sought to charge the defendants in error as trustees for the complainant, and to require an assignment of the lease to him. The District Court held against complainant, and that decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 226 Fed. 176, 141 C. C. A. 174.\n In order to maintain a suit of this sort the complainant must establish not only that the action of the Secretary \n\n[246 U.S. 110, 118]\n\u00a0\n was wrong in approving the other lease, but that the complainant was himself entitled to an approval of his lease, and that it was refused to him because of an erroneous ruling of law by the Secretary. Bohall v. Dilla, \n114 U.S. 47\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 782.\n The statutes of the United States provide:\n Section 20 of the Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 145, c. 1876:\n'All leases and rental contracts, except leases and rental contracts for not exceeding one year, for agricultural purposes, for lands other than homesteads, of full-blood allottees of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek and Seminole Tribes shall be in writing, and subject to approval by the Secretary of the Interior, and shall be absolutely void and of no effect without such approval: ... Provided, ... that all leases entered into for a period of more than one year, shall be recorded in conformity to the law applicable to recording instruments now in force in said Indian Territory.'\n\n Section 2 of the Act of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312, c. 199:\n'That leases of restricted lands for oil, gas or other mining purposes, ... may be made, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, under rules and regulations provided by the Secretary of the Interior, and not otherwise.'\n\n The Act of March 1, 1907, 34 Stat. at Large, 1026, c. 2285:\n'The filing heretofore or hereafter of any lease in the office of the United States Indian Agent, Union Agency, Muskogee, Indian Territory, shall be deemed constructive notice.'\n\n Under the authority to make rules the Secretary of the Interior provided:\n'All leases shall be in quadruplicate, and, with the papers required, shall be filed within thirty days from and after the date of execution by the lessor with the United States Indian Agent at Union Agency, Muskogee, Oklahoma.'\n\n Whatever may be the effect of this rule providing for \n\n[246 U.S. 110, 119]\n\u00a0\n the filin of leases within thirty days from and after their execution, in view of the requirements of the statutes, the lease can have no validity without the Secretary's approval. The protection of the Indian's rights is left to the Indian Bureau of which the Secretary is the head, and the courts may only interfere to protect the rights of others when they are invaded by clearly unauthorized action.\n Much stress is placed in argument upon the provisions of section 20 of the Act of April 26, 1906, requiring leases entered into for a period of more than one year to be recorded in conformity with the law requiring the recording of conveyances in force in the Territory; and upon the Act of March 1, 1907, providing that the filing of the lease in the office of the Indian Agency shall be deemed constructive notice. An elaborate argument is based on these requirements, and the statutes of Arkansas in force in the Territory are set out in the brief, which, it is contended, show the necessity of recording such instruments in order to give constructive notice to persons dealing with the title. But these requirements do not relieve the appellant of the primary difficulty of maintaining this suit; the lack of a showing that his lease would have been approved but for a mistake of law which resulted in the approval of the lease to another.\n The statute is plain in its provisions-that no lease, of the character here in question, can be valid without the approval of the Secretary. Such approval rests in the exercise of his discretion; unquestionably this authority was given to him for the protection of Indians against their own improvidence and the designs of those who would obtain their property for inadequate compensation. It is also true that the law does not vest arbitrary authority in the Secretary of the Interior. But it does give him power to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the lease presented for his action, and to grant or withhold approval as his judgment may dictate. \n\n[246 U.S. 110, 120]\n\u00a0\n There is nothing in this record to show that approval of the appellant's lease has been given by the Secretary as required by the statute. On the contrary, it appears that the Secretary approved another lease of the same land, and has withheld his approval of the one under which the appellant claims. The Secretary declares in substance in the finding which we have quoted, being his final action in the case, that the prior recording of one lease does not abridge his authority to find that another lease, regularly executed and filed, is more to the allottee's interest and better entitled to approval. It does not appear that had he disapproved the Gunsburg lease, he would have approved the one to appellant, and until this affirmatively appears, he has no standing which permits a court by its decree to award the leasehold to him.\n We find nothing in this record to indicate that the Secretary of the Interior has exceeded the authority which the law vests in him. The fact that he has given reasons in the discussion of the case, which might not in all respects meet with approval, does not deprive him of authority to exercise the discretionary power with which by statute he is invested.

OF VIRGINIA(1918)\nNo. 127\nArgued: January 3, 1918Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Eppa Hunton, Jr., of Richmond, Va., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. D. Hank, Jr., of Richmond, Va., for the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit concerns section 45 of the Virginia general taxing statute ( Acts Extra Sess. 1902-04, c. 148) as amended in 1915, which is in the margin. \n1\n It will be observed that the section imposes an annual license tax upon all persons or corporations carrying on a \n\n[246 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n merchandise business at any place in the state, the amount being determined by the sum of the purchases during the year. It will be further seen that the amount of the purchases includes 'all goods, wares and merchandise manufactured by such merchant and sold or offered for sale, in this state, as merchandise,' and that the section also contains a provision excluding from the operation of the license 'manufacturers taxed on capital by this state, who offer for sale at the place of manufacture, goods, wares and merchandise manufactured by them.'\n Armour & Co., a New Jersey corporation engaged in the packing house business, and having various establishments in several states, carried on in Virginia the merchandise business of selling packing house products at the respective agencies which they had established. For the purposes of the merchant's license in question the company was called upon to return the sum of its purchases including the amount shipped into the state for sale at its agencies whether or not manufactured by it. The corporation declined to comply and commenced this suit to enjoin the enforcement of the statute in so far as it required the inclusion in the amount of purchases of merchandise manufactured by the corporation in other states and shipped into Virginia for sale. It was charged that to the extent stated the statute was in conflict with the Constitution of the United States because of the provision excluding from liability for license persons who manufactured merchandise in Virginia and sold the same at the place of manufacture for the following reasons: (a) Because as the result of such exclusion the statute discriminated against the company to the extent that it shipped goods manufactured by it into Virginia to be sold and therefore was a direct burden on interstate commerce; (b) because the statute deprived manufacturers in other states of the benefit of section 2 of article 4 guaranteeing to the citizens of each state 'all privileges and immunities \n\n[246 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n of citizens in the several states'; and (c) because the statute in the respects stated was repugnant to the equal protection and privilege and immunities clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The trial court enjoined the enforcement of the statute to the extent complained of and its action on appeal was reversed by the court below. It was held that the statute was inherently within the state legislative power and that the difference between a manufacturer selling goods by him made at the place where they were manufactured and one engaged in a mercantile business even if his business consisted in whole or in part of the selling of goods by him manufactured at a place other than the place of manufacture was such as to afford adequate ground for their distinct classification and hence justified the provision of the statute including one in the merchant's license and excluding the other. In addition, construing the statute, it was decided that it was not discriminatory since the exclusion from the license tax of manufacturers selling at their place of manufacture was open to all whether noncitizens or even nonresidents who manufactured in Virginia and because the liability for the merchant's license embraced even those who manufactured in Virginia if they sold as merchants the goods by them manufactured at a place other than the place of manufacture. From this latter conclusion it was decided that if any disadvantage resulted to the person selling as a merchant in Virginia goods manufactured by him in another state by subjecting him to a license when such license did not include the manufacturer selling in Virginia at the place of manufacture, the disadvantage was a mere indirect consequence of a lawful and nondiscriminatory exercise of state authority and afforded no basis for holding the statute to be repugnant to the clauses of the Constitution of the United States as contended. 118 Va. 242, 87 S. E. 610.\n All the constitutional grounds which were thus held \n\n[246 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n to be without merit are within the errors assigned and relied upon although predominance in argument is given to the asserted repugnancy of the statute to the commerce clause of the Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3); and we come briefly to consider them all.\n In the first place we are of opinion that the distinction upon which the classification in the statute rests between a manufacturer selling goods by him made at their place of manufacture and one engaged as a merchant in whole or in part in selling goods of his manufacture at a place of business other than where they were made is so obvious as to require nothing but a mere statement of the two classes. All question concerning the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment may therefore be put out of view.\n In the second place, we are also of opinion that the interpretation given by the court below to the statute excludes all basis for the content on that the provision of the statute imposing the license tax upon the one class and not upon the other gave rise to such discrimination as resulted in a direct burden upon interstate commerce. And this whether the statute be considered from the point of view of the power of the state to enact it inherently considered, or of the power as tested by the necessary operation and effect of the statute, if any, upon interstate commerce and the plenary and exclusive power of Congress to regulate the same.\n In the third place we also conclude that as the subject-matter of the statute was plainly within the legislative authority of the state and as the previous conclusions exclude the conception of the repugnancy of the statute to the provisions of the Constitution just considered, it necessarily follows that there is no ground for the assertion that the statute conflicted with the privileges and immunities clause of article 4 of the Constitution or of the clause in the Fourteenth Amendment providing that:- \n\n[246 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n 'No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.'\n But, it is urged, the statute should be held to be a burden on interstate commerce and repugnant to the Constitution because of the disadvantage to which, it is insisted, it necessarily by way of a license tax subjected goods manufactured in another state when sold in Virginia by a merchant manufacturing the same, while no such tax was by the statute imposed on a manufacturer in Virginia selling his goods so manufactured at the place of their manufacture. But we have already tested the statute by its necessary operation and effect and found it not to be repugnant to the commerce clause. Hence this argument but repeats in a different form a contention already disposed of. It follows therefore that if the asserted disadvantage be real and not imaginary, it would be one not direct because not arising from the operation and effect of the statute, but indirect as a mere consequence of the situation of the persons and property affected and of the nondiscriminating exercise by the state of power which it had a right to exert without violating the Constitution-which is indeed but to say that the disadvantage relied upon, if any, is but the indirect result of our dual system of government.\n In other words, to resume, the error of the argument results from confounding the direct burden necessarily arising from a statute which is unconstitutional because it exercises a power concerning interstate commerce not possessed or because of the unlawful discriminations which its provisions express or by operation necessarily bring about and the indirect and wholly negligible influence on interstate commerce, even if in some aspects detrimental, arising from a statute which there was power to enact and in which there was an absence of all discrimination, whether express or implied as the result of the \n\n[246 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n necessary operation and effect of its provisions. The distinction between the two has been enforced from the beginning as vital to the perpetuation of our constitutional system. Indeed, as correctly pointed out by the court below, that principle as applied in adjudged cases is here directly applicable and authoritatively controlling. New York v. Roberts, \n171 U.S. 658\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 58; Reymann Brewing Co. v. Brister, \n179 U.S. 445\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 201. In saying this we have not overlooked or failed to consider the many cases cited in the argument at bar on the theory that they are to the contrary, when in fact they all rest upon the conclusion that a direct burden on interstate commerce arose from statutes inherently void for want of power or if within the power possessed were intrinsically repugnant to the commerce clause because of discriminations against interstate commerce which they contained.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Every person, firm, company or corporation engaged in the business of a merchant shall pay a license tax for the privilege of doing business in this state t be graduated by the doing business in chases made by him during the period for which the license is granted, and all goods, wares and merchandise manufactured by such merchant and sold or offered for sale, in this state, as merchandise, shall be considered as purchases within the meaning of this section: Provided, that this section shall not be construed as applying to manufacurers taxed on capital by this state, who offer for sale at the place of manufacture, goods, wares and merchandise manufactured by them.

C., for the United states.\n\n\n[245 U.S. 366, 375]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are here concerned with some of the provisions of the Act of May 18, 1917 (Public No. 12, 65th Congress, c. 15, 40 Stat. 76), entitled 'An act to authorize the President to increase temporarily the military establishment of the United States.' The law, as its opening sentence declares, was intended to supply temporarily the increased military force which was required by the existing emergency, the war then and now flagrant. The clauses we must pass upon and those which will throw light on their significance are briefly summarized.\n The act proposed to raise a national army, first, by increasing the regular force to its maximum strength and there maintaining it; second, by incorporating into such army the members of the National Guard and National Guard Reserve already in the service of the United States (Act of Congress of June 5, 1916, c. 134, 39 Stat. 211) and maintaining their organizations to their full strength; third, by giving the President power in his discretion to organize by volunteer enlistment four divisions of infantry; fourth, by subjecting all male citizens between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to duty in the national army for the period of the existing emergency after the proclamation of the President announcing the necessity for their service; and fifth, by providing for \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 376]\n\u00a0\n selecting from the body so called, on the further proclamation of the President, 500,000 enlisted men, and a second body of the same number should the President in his discretion deem it necessary. To carry out its purposes the act made it the duty of those liable to the call to present themselves for registration on the proclamation of the President so as to subject themselves to the terms of the act and provided full federal means for carrying out the selective draft. It gave the President in his discretion power to create local boards to consider claims for exemption for physical disability or otherwise made by those called. The act exempted from subjection to the draft designated United States and state officials as well as those already in the military or naval service of the United States, regular or duly ordained ministers of religion and theological students under the conditions provided for, and while relieving from military service in the strict sense the members of religious sects as enumerated whose tenets excluded the moral right to engage in war, nevertheless subjected such persons to the performance of service of a noncombatant character to be defined by the President.\n The proclamation of the President calling the persons designated within the ages described in the statute was made and the plaintiffs in error who were in the class and under the statute were obliged to present themselves for registration and subject themselves to the law failed to do so and were prosecuted under the statute for the penalties for which it provided. They all defended by denying that there had been conferred by the Constitution upon Congress the power to compel military service by a selective draft and if such power had been given by the Constitution to Congress, the terms of the particular act for various reasons caused it to be beyond the power and repugnant to the Constitution. The cases are here for review because of the constitu- \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 377]\n\u00a0\n tional questions thus raised, convictions having resulted from instructions of the courts that the legal defences were without merit and that the statute was constitutional.\n The possession of authority to enact the statute must be found in the clauses of the Constitution giving Congress power 'to declare war; ... to raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years; ... to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.' Article 1,  8. And of course the powers conferred by these provisions like all other powers given carry with them as pro ided by the Constitution the authority 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers.' Article 1,  8.\n As the mind cannot conceive an army without the men to compose it, on the face of the Constitution the objection that it does not give power to provide for such men would seem to be too frivolous for further notice. It is said, however, that since under the Constitution as originally framed state citizenship was primary and United States citizenship but derivative and dependent thereon, therefore the power conferred upon Congress to raise armies was only coterminous with United States citizenship and could not be exerted so as to cause that citizenship to lose its dependent character and dominate state citizenship. But the proposition simply denies to Congress the power to raise armies which the Constitution gives. That power by the very terms of the Constitution, being delegated, is supreme. Article 6. In truth the contention simply assails the wisdom of the framers of the Constitution in conferring authority on Congress and in not retaining it as it was under the Confederation in the several states. Further it is said, the right to provide is not denied by calling for volunteer enlistments, but it does not and \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 378]\n\u00a0\n cannot include the power to exact enforced military duty by the citizen. This however but challenges the existence of all power, for a governmental power which has no sanction to it and which therefore can only be exercised provided the citizen consents to its exertion is in no substantial sense a power. It is argued, however, that although this is abstractly true, it is not concretely so because as compelled military service is repugnant to a free government and in conflict with all the great guarantees of the Constitution as to individual liberty, it must be assumed that the authority to raise armies was intended to be limited to the right to call an army into existence counting alone upon the willingness of the citizen to do his duty in time of public need, that is, in time of war. But the premise of this proposition is so devoid of foundation that it leaves not even a shadow of ground upon which to base the conclusion. Let us see if this is not at once demonstrable. It may not be doubted that the very sonception of a just government and its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need, and the right to compel it. Vattel, Law of Nations, book III, cc. 1 and 2. To do more than state the proposition is absolutely unnecessary in view of the practical illustration afforded by the almost universal legislation to that effect now in force. \n1\n In England it is certain that before the \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 379]\n\u00a0\n Norman Conquest the duty of the great militant body of the citizens was recognized and enforceable. Blackstone, book I, c. 13. It is unnecessary to follow the long controversy between Crown and Parliament as to the branch of the government in which the power resided, since there never was any doubt that it semewhere resided. So also it is wholly unnecessary to explore the situation for the purpose of fixing the sources whence in England it came to be understood that the citizen or the force organized from the militia as such could not without their consent be compelled to render service in a foreign country, since there is no room to contend that such principle ever rested upon any challenge of the right of Parliament to impose compulsory duty upon the citizen to perform military duty wherever the public exigency exacted whether at home or abroad. This is exemplified by the present English Service Act. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n In the Colonies before the separation from England there cannot be the slightest doubt that the right to enforce military service was unquestioned and that practical effect was given to the power in many cases. Indeed \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 380]\n\u00a0\n the brief of the government contains a list of Colonial Acts manifesting the power and its enf rcement in more than two hundred cases. And this exact situation existed also after the separation. Under the Articles of Confederation it is true Congress had no such power, as its authority was absolutely limited to making calls upon the states for the military forces needed to create and maintain the army, each state being bound for its quota as called. But it is indisputable that the states in response to the calls made upon them met the situation when they deemed it necessary by directing enforced military service on the part of the citizens. In fact the duty of the citizen to render military service and the power to compel him against his consent to do so was expressly sanctioned by the Constitutions of at least nine of the states, an illustration being afforded by the following provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776:\n'That every member of society hath a right to be protected in the enjoyment of life, liberty, and property, and therefore is bound to contribute his proportion toward the expense of that protection, and yield his personal service when necessary, or an equivalent thereto.' Article 8 (Thorpe, American Charters, Constitutions and Organic Laws, vol. 5, pp. 3081, 3083).3\n\n While it is true that the states were sometimes slow in exerting the power in order to fill their quotas-a condition shown by resolutions of Congress calling upon them to comply by exerting their compulsory power to draft and by earnest requests by Washington to Congress that a demand be made upon the states to \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 381]\n\u00a0\n resort to drafts to fill their quotas4-that fact serves to demonstrate instead of to challenge the existence of the authority. A default in exercising a duty may not be resorted to as a reason for denying its existence.\n When the Constitution came to be formed it may not be disputed that one of the recognized necessities for its adoption was the want of power in Congress to raise an army and the dependence upon the states for their quotas. In supplying the power it was manifestly intended to give it all and leave none to the states, since besides the delegation to Congress of authority to raise armies the Constitution prohibited the states, without the consent of Congress, form keeping troops in time of peace or engaging in war. Article 1,  10.\n To argue that as the state authority over the militia prior to the Constitution embraced every citizen, the right of Congress to raise an army should not be considered as granting authority to compel the citizen's service in the army, is but to express in a different form the denial of the right to call any citizen to the army. Nor is this met by saying that it does not exclude the right of Congress to organize an army by voluntary enlistments, that is, by the consent of the citizens, for if the proposition be true, the right of the citizen to give consent would be controlled by the same prohibition which would deprive Congress of the right to compel unless it can be said that although Congress had not the right to call because of state authority, the citizen had a right to obey the call and set aside state authority if he pleased to do so. And a like conclusion demonstrates the want of foundation for the contention that although it be within the power to call the citizen into the army without his consent, the army into which he enters after the call is to be limited \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 382]\n\u00a0\n in some respects to services for which the militia it is assumed may only be used, since this admits the appropriateness of the call to military service in the army and the power to make it and yet destroys the purpose for which the call is authorized-the raising of armies to be under the control of the United States.\n The fallacy of the argument results from confounding the constitutional provisions concerning the militia with that conferring upon Congress the power to raise armies. It treats them as one while they are different. This is the militia clause:\n'The Congress shall have power: ... To provide for calling for h the militia to execute the laws of the nation, suppress insurrections and repel invasions; to provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states, respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.' Article 1,  8.\n\n The line which separates it from the army power is not only inherently plainly marked by the text of the two clauses, but will stand out in bolder relief by considering the condition before the Constitution was adopted and the remedy which it provided for the military situation with which it dealt. The right on the one hand of Congress under the Confederation to call on the states for forces and the duty on the other of the states to furnish when called, embraced the complete power of government over the subject. When the two were combined and were delegated to Congress all governmental power on that subject was conferred, a result manifested not only by the grant made but by the limitation expressly put upon the states on the subject. The army sphere therefore embraces such complete authority. But the duty of exerting the power thus conferred in all its plenitude was not \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 383]\n\u00a0\n made at once obligatory but was wisely left to depend upon the discretion of Congress as to the arising of the exigencies which would call it in part or in whole into play. There was left therefore under the sway of the states undelegated the control of the militia to the extent that such control was not taken away by the exercise by Congress of its power to raise armies. This did not diminish the military power or curb the full potentiality of the right to exert it but left an area of authority requiring to be provided for (the militia area) unless and until by the exertion of the military power of Congress that area had been circumscribed or totally disappeared. This, therefore, is what was dealt with by the militia provision. It diminished the occasion for the exertion by Congress of its military power beyond the strict necessities for its exercise by giving the power to Congress to direct the organization and training of the militia (evidently to prepare such militia in the event of the exercise of the army power) although leaving the carrying out of such command to the states. It further conduced to the same result by delegating to Congress the right to call on occasions which were specified for the militia force, thus again obviating the necessity for exercising the army power to the extent of being ready for every conceivable contingency. This purpose is made manifest by the provision preserving the organization of the militia so far as formed when called for such special purposes although subjecting the militia when so called to the paramount authority of the United States. Tarble's Case, 13 Wall. 397, 408. But because under the express regulations the power was given to call for specified purposes without exerting the army power, it cannot follow that the latter power when exerted was not complete to the extent of its exertion and dominant. Because the power of Congress to raise armies was not required to be exerted to its full limit but only as in the discretion of Congress it was deemed the public \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 384]\n\u00a0\n interest required, furnishes no ground for supposing that the complete power was lost by its partial exertion. Because, moreover, the power granted to Congress to raise armies in its potentiality was susceptible of narrowing the area over which the militia clause operated, affords no ground for confounding the two areas which were distinct and separate to the end of confusing both the powers and thus weakening or destroying both.\n And upon this understanding of the two powers the legislative and executive authority has been exerted from the beginning. From the act of the first session of Congress carrying over the army of the government under the Confederatio to the United States under the Constitution (Act of September 29, 1789, c. 25, 1 Stat. 95) down to 1812 the authority to raise armies was regularly exerted as a distinct and substantive power, the force being raised and recruited by enlistment. Except for one act formulating a plan by which the entire body of citizens (the militia) subject to military duty was to be organized in every state (Act of May 8, 1792, c. 33, 1 Stat. 271) which was never carried into effect, Congress confined itself to providing for the organization of a specified number distributed among the states according to their quota to be trained as directed by Congress and to be called by the President as need might require. \n5\n When the War of 1812 came the result of these two forces composed the army to be relied upon by Congress to carry on the war. Either because it proved to be weak in numbers or because of insubordination developed among the forces called and manifested by their refusal to cross the border,6 \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 385]\n\u00a0\n the government determined that the excrcise of the power to organize an army by compulsory draft was necessary and Mr. Monroe, the Secretary of War (Mr. Madison being President), in a letter to Congress recommended several plans of legislation on that subject. It suffices to say that by each of them it was proposed that the United States deal directly with the body of citizens subject to military duty and call a designated number out of the population between the ages of 18 and 45 for service in the army. The power which it was recommended be exerted was clearly an unmixed federal power dealing with the subject from the sphere of the authority given to Congress to raise armies and not from the sphere of the right to deal with the militia as such, whether organized or unorganized. A bill was introduced giving effect to the plan. Opposition developed, but we need nor stop to consider it because it substantially rested upon the incompatibility of compulsory military service with free government, a subject which from what we have said has been disposed of. Peace came before the bill was enacted.\n Down to the Mexican War the legislation exactly portrayed the same condition of mind which we have previously stated. In that war, however, no draft was suggested, because the army created by the United States immediately resulting from the exercise by Congress of its power to raise armies, that organized under its direction from the militia and the volunteer commands which were furnished, proved adequate to carry the war to a successful conclusion.\n So the course of legislation from that date to 1861 affords no ground for any other than the same conception of legislative power which we have already stated. In that year when the mutterings of the dread conflict which was to come began to be heard and the proclamation of the President calling a force into existence was issued it \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 386]\n\u00a0\n was addressed to the body organized out of the militia and trained by the states in accordance with the previous acts of Congress. Proclamation of April 15, 1861, 12 Stat. 1258. That force being inadequate to meet the situation, an act was passed authorizing the acceptance of 500,000 volunteers by the President to be by him organized into a national army. Act of July 22, 1861, c. 9, 12 Stat. 268. This was soon followed by another act increasing the force of the militia to be organized by the states for the purpose of being drawn upon when trained under the direction of Congress (Act of July 29, 1861, c. 25, 12 Stat. 281), the two acts when considered together presenting in the clearest possible form the distinction between the power of Congress to raise armies and its authority under the militia clause. But it soon became manifest that more men were required. As a result the Act of March 3, 1863 (c. 75, 12 Stat. 731), was adopted entitled 'An act for enrolling and calling out the national forces and for other purposes.' By that act which was clearly intended to directly exert upon all the citizens of t e United States the national power which it had been proposed to exert in 1814 on the recommendation of the then Secretary of War, Mr. Monroe, every male citizen of the United States between the ages of 20 and 45 was made subject by the direct action of Congress to be called by compulsory draft to service in a national army at such time and in such numbers as the President in his discretion might find necessary. In that act, as in the one of 1814, and in this one, the means by which the act was to be enforced were directly federal and the force to be raised as a result of the draft was therefore typically national as distinct from the call into active service of the militia as such. And under the power thus exerted four separate calls for draft were made by the President and enforced, that of July, 1863, of February and March, 1864, of July and Decem- \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 387]\n\u00a0\n ber, 1864, producing a force of about a quarter of a million men. \n7\n It is undoubted that the men thus raised by draft were treated as subject to direct national authority and were used either in filling the gaps occasioned by the vicissitudes of war in the ranks of the existing national forces or for the purpose of organizing such new units as were deemed to be required. It would be childish to deny the value of the added strength which was thus afforded. Indeed in the official report of the Provost Marshal General, just previously referred to in the margin, reviewing the whole subject it was stated that it was the efficient aid resulting from the forces created by the draft at a very critical moment of the civil strife which obviated a disaster which seemed impending and carried that struggle to a complete and successful conclusion.\n Brevity prevents doing more than to call attention to the fact that the organized body of militia within the states as trained by the states under the direction of Congress became known as the National Guard. Act of January 21, 1903, c. 196, 32 Stat. 775; National Defense Act of June 5, 1916, c. 134, 39 Stat. 211. And to make further preparation from among the great body of the citizens, an additional number to be determined by the President was directed to be organized and trained by the states as the National Guard Reserve. National Defense Act, supra.\n Thus sanctioned as is the act before us by the text of the Constitution, and by its significance as read in the light of the fundamental principles with which the subject is concerned, by the power recognized and carried into effect in many civilized countries, by the authority and practice of the colonies before the Revolution, of the states under the Confederation and of the government \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 388]\n\u00a0\n since the formation of the Constitution, the want of merit in the contentions that the act in the particulars which we have been previously called upon to consider was beyond the constitutional power of Congress, is manifest. Cogency, however, if possible, is added to the demonstration by pointing out that in the only case to which we have been referred where the constitutionality of the act of 1863 was contemporaneously challenged on grounds akin to, if not absolutely identical with, those here urged, the validity of the act was maintained for reasons not different from those which control our judgment. Kneedler v. Lane, 45 Pa. 238. And as further evidence that the conclusion we reach is but the inevitable consequence of the provisions of the Constitution as effect follows cause, we briefly recur to events in another environment. The seceding states wrote into the Constitution which was adopted to regulate the government which they sought to establish, in identical words the provisions of the Constitution of the United States which we here have under consideration. And when the right to enforce under that instrument a selective draft law which was enacted not differing in principle from the one here in question was challenged, its validity was upheld evidently after great consideration by the courts of Virginia, of Georgia, of Texas, of Alabama, of Mississippi and of North Carolina, the opinions in some of the cases copiously and critically reviewing the whole grounds which we have stated. Burroughs v. Peyton, 16 Grat. (Va.) 470; Jeffers v. Fair, 33 Ga. 347; Daly and Fitzgerald v. Harris, 33 Ga. Supp. 38, 54; Barber v. Irwin, 34 Ga. 27; Parker v. Kaughman, 34 Ga. 136; Ex parte Coupland, 26 Tex. 386; Ex parte Hill, 38 Ala. 429; In re Emerson, 39 Ala. 437; In re Pille, 39 Ala. 459; Simmons v. Miller, 40 Miss. 19; Gatlin v. Walton, 60 N. C. 333, 408.\n In reviewing the subject we have hitherto considered \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 389]\n\u00a0\n it as it has been argued from the point of view of the Constitution as it stood prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. But to avoid all misapprehension we briefly direct attention to that amendment for the purpose of pointing out, as has been frequently done in the past,8 how completely it broadened the national scope of the government under the Constitution by causing citizenship of the United States to be paramount and dominant instead of being subordinate and derivative, and therefore operating as it does upon all the powers conferred by the Constitution leaves no possible support for the contentions made if their want of merit was otherwise not so clearly made manifest.\n It remains only to consider contentions which, while not disputing power, challenge the act because of the repugnancy to the Constitution supposed to result from some of its provisions. First, we are of opinion that the contention that the act is void as a delegation of federal power to state officials because of some of its administrative features is too wanting in merit to require further notice. Second, we think that the contention that the statute is void because vesting administrative officers with legislative discretion has been so completely adversely settled as to require reference only to some of the decided cases. Field v. Clark, \n143 U.S. 649\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 495; Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 U.S. 470\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 349; Intermountain Rate Cases, \n234 U.S. 476\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 986; First National Bank v. Union Trust Co., \n244 U.S. 416\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 734. A like conclusion also adversely disposes of a similar claim concerning the conferring of judicial power. Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470, 497\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 349; West v. Hitchcock, \n205 U.S. 80\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 423; Ocean Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, \n214 U.S. 320\n, 338-340, 29 Sup. Ct. 671; Zakonaite v. Wolf, \n226 \nU.S. 272, 275\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 31. And we pass without anything but statement \n\n[245 U.S. 366, 390]\n\u00a0\n the proposition that an establishment of a religion or an interference with the free exercise thereof repugnant to the First Amendment resulted from the exemption clauses of the act to which we at the outset referred because we think its unsoundness is too apparent to require us to do more.\n Finally, as we are unable to conceive upon what theory the exaction by government from the citizen of the performance of his supreme and noble duty of contributing to the defense of the rights and honor of the nation as the result of a war declared by the great representative body of the people can be said to be the imposition of involuntary servitude in violation of the prohibitions of the Thirteenth Amendment, we are constrained to the conclusion that the contention to that effect is refuted by its mere statement.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the argument of the government it is stated: 'The Statesman's Yearbook for 1917 cites the following governments as enforcing military service: Argentine Republic, p. 656; Austria-Hungary, p. 667; Belgium, p. 712; Brazil, p. 738; Bulgaria, p. 747; Bolivia, p. 728; Columbia, p. 790; Chili, p. 754; China, p. 770; Denmark, p. 811; Ecuador, p. 820; France, p. 841; Greece, p. 1001; Germany, p. 914; Guatemala, p. 1009; Honduras, p. 1018; Italy, p. 1036; Japan, p. 1064; Mexico, p. 1090; Montenegro, p. 1098; Netherlands, p. 1191; Nicaragua, p. 1142 Norway, p. 1152; Peru, p. 1191; Portugal, p. 1201; Roumania, p. 1220; Russia, p. 1240; Serbia, p. 1281; Siam, p. 1288; Spain, p. 1300; Switzerland, p. 1337; Salvador, p. 1270; Turkey, p. 1353.'

BODIE(1918)\nNo. 120\nArgued: January 4, 1918Decided: January 21, 1918\n\n\n\n Plaintiff in error, Bates, filed a complaint in divorce against defendant in error in the chancery court of Benton \n\n[245 U.S. 520, 521]\n\u00a0\n county, state of Arkansas, alleging cruelty and praying for an absolute divorce.\n Defendant in error filed an answer denying the charge against her and a cross-complaint accusing him of cruelty.\n In the cross-complaint she alleged that Bates was the owner of real and personal property of the fair value of $75,000, consisting of 320 acres of land in York county, Neb., which she described, and alleged further that she was the owner in her own right of $3,000, $2,500 of which she loaned to Bates, taking his note therefor bearing interest at 8 per cent. per annum.\n She prayed for an absolute divorce, for the restoration of the money borrowed from her, and 'that the court award her such alimony as the facts and law warrant, and all other proper and necessary relief.' The court, after hearing, dismissed Bates' complaint for want of equity and granted her a divorce, and alimony was decreed her as follows:\n'It is ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court that the defendant Lucie Bates have and recover of and from the defendant [plaintiff] Edward Bates the sum of $5,111.00 in full of alimony and all other demands set forth in cross-bill which judgment is rendered by the consent of the plaintiff on condition that no appeal be taken by the defendant from the judgment and decree herein rendered.'\n\n Certain personal property, consisting of silverware and household furniture, was adjudged to her and a lien was declared on a lot in the city of Siloam Springs, state of Arkansas, and certain notes and mortgages amounting to the sum of $2,801.06 were required to be deposited with the clerk of the court as additional security. He, however, was given the power to sell the same, but required to deposit the proceeds of the sale with the clerk until the sum awarded her be paid, for which no execution was to issue for six months. It was \n\n[245 U.S. 520, 522]\n\u00a0\n also decreed:\n'That she be restored to her maiden name, ... and that the bonds of matrimony entered into' between her and Bates 'be dissolved, set aside, and held for naught.'\n\n She subsequently brought this suit against him in a Nebraska state court repeating the charges of cruelty against him and the proceedings in Arkansas resulting in a decree for divorce and alimony as stated above, and-'that the court of chancery did not have any jurisdiction of or over the property of complainant which was situated outside of the state of Arkansas, and that in consequence of that fact in determining the amount of alimony to be granted the defendant in that suit, he was limited and prohibited from taking into account the above-mentioned property situated in York county, Neb. Said court was limited by the laws of Arkansas from taking into consideration said property lying in York county, Neb., in determining the amount of alimony that should be granted to defendant in that suit, who is plaintiff herein.'\n The laws of the state of Arkansas further provide, she alleged, that:\n'Where the divorce is granted to the wife each party is restored to all property not disposed of at the commencement of the action, which either party obtains from or through the other during the marriage, and in consideration or by reason thereof; and the wife so granted a divorce from the husband shall be entitled to one-third of all lands of which her husband is seised of an estate of inheritance, at any time during the marriage, for her life, unless the same shall have been released by her in legal form.'\n\n She further alleged that the land in Nebraska was worth the sum of $ 48,000; that the amount of alimony allowed her by the Arkansas decree was largely inadequate for her support and was not such a fair proportion of the property of Bates owned by him at the date of \n\n[245 U.S. 520, 523]\n\u00a0\n the decree as she then was and is entitled to in view of the circumstances. She prayed that a reasonable sum be adjudged her out of the York county property in addition to the amount allowed her by the Arkansas decree. A copy of the decree was attached to the complaint.\n Bates demurred to the complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and, she declining to plead further, the cause was dismissed for want of equity. The judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court.\n On the return of the case to the trial court Bates answered. He set up the proceedings in Arkansas, and pleaded the decree and alleged that it was made upon full consideration of the evidence and the issues, and that the court took into consideration the value of the land in York county, Neb., in determining the amount of alimony to be awarded to plaintiff; that the decree remained 'in full force and effect, except that the amount of alimony awarded therein has been fully paid' by him; that the Arkansas court in awarding the alimony 'took into consideration all of the property owned by' him, 'which decree, so far as it relates to alimony, having been fully satisfied, has become a full and complete bar to further proceedings on the part of the plaintiff in this suit, defendant in that, to recover additional alimony under the laws of Arkansas'; and that, further, under the Constitution of the United States, the findings and decree are entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of Nebraska, and constitute a full and complete bar to plaintiff's right to recover additional alimony under the laws of the state of Nebraska.\n It was adjudged and decreed that plaintiff (defendant in error here) have and recover from the defendant (plaintiff in error here) the 'sum of $ 10,000, being the amount found due her as alimony.' The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court, to review which this writ of error was prosecuted. \n\n[245 U.S. 520, 524]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. C. Ricketts and A. W. Field, both of Lincoln, Neb., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Samuel P. Davids n, of Tecumseh, Neb., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court.\n A motion is made to dismiss on the ground, as contended, that the decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska was based upon a construction of the statutes of Arkansas and concluded therefrom that the District Court of Arkansas 'had no jurisdiction to take the Nebraska lands of this plaintiff in error into consideration in fixing the amount of allowance to this defendant in error, and as a matter of fact did not do so'; that his conclusion was reached 'by reason of the peculiar statute of Arkansas which governs and controls the courts of that state in fixing the allowance of alimony to a wife, in all cases in which the divorce is granted on her petition' (italics counsel's) and the court 'was limited and controlled by that statute.' It is hence contended that the full faith and credit which the Constitution of the United States requires to be given to the judicial proceedings of another state was not denied to the Arkansas decree, but that the Supreme Court of Nebraska, considering the statutes of Arkansas, gave to the decree the value those statutes gave to it.\n But this is the question in controversy. The decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska is challenged for not according to the decree the credit it is entitled \n\n[245 U.S. 520, 525]\n\u00a0\n to and it is no answer to the challenge to say that the Supreme Court committed no error in responding to it, and that, therefore, there is no federal question for review. Andrews v. Andrews, \n188 U.S. 14\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 237. The motion to dismiss is denied.\n The decision of the Supreme Court affirming the subsequent judgment of the District Court on the merits was by a divided court and the opinion and dissenting opinion were well-reasoned and elaborate. The ultimate propositions decided were that the courts of Nebraska would entertain a suit for alimony out of real estate situated in that state after a decree for absolute divorce in another state, the latter state having no jurisdiction of the land, notwithstanding the decree awarding alimony, the decree not appearing to have been rendered by consent or not having taken such land into account; and that besides the Arkansas court had no jurisdiction to render a money judgment for alimony.\n The propositions were supported and opposed by able discussion, some of which was occupied in reconciling a conflict of decision in Nebraska, a later decision made to give away to an earlier one. We are not called upon to trace or consider the reasoning of the opinion further than to determine the correctness of its elements, and this determination can be made by reference to the divorce proceedings in Arkansas and the decree of the court rendered therein.\n The case is not in broad compass and depends upon the application of the quite familiar principle that determines the estoppel of judgments, and the principle would seem to have special application to a judgment for divorce and alimony. They are usually concomitants in the same suit-some cases say must be-or, rather, that as alimony is an incident of divorce, it must be awarded by the same decree that grants the separation. And it is the practice to unite them, as alimony \n\n[245 U.S. 520, 526]\n\u00a0\n necessarily depends upon a variety of circumstances more adequately determined in the suit for divorce, not only the right to it, but the measure of it, all circumstances upon which it depends then naturally brought under the view and judgment of the court. Whether, however, the right to it should be litigated in the suit for divorce, or may be sought subsequently in another, the principle is applicable that what is once adjudged cannot be tried again. And this court has established a test of the thing adjudged and the extent of its estoppel. It is: If the second action is upon the same claim or demand as that in which the judgment pleaded was rendered, the judgment is an absolute bar not only of what was decided but of what might have been decided. If the second action was upon a different claim or demand, then the judgment is an estoppel 'only as to those matters in issue or points controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered.' Cromwell v. County of Sac, \n94 U.S. 351\n, 353; Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co. v. Kirven, \n215 U.S. 252\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 78; Troxell v. Del., Lack. & Western R. R. Co., \n227 U.S. 434\n, 33 Sup.

Ct. 506\n\n\n But how find the matters in issue or the points controverted upon the determination of which the judgment was rendered? The obvious answer would seem to be that for the issues we must go to the pleadings; for the response to them and their determination, to the judgment; and each may furnish a definition of the other.

If there be generality and uncertainty, to what extent there may be specification and limitation by evidence aliunde there is some conflict in the cases. But we are not called upon to review or reconcile them. Our rule is that an estoppel by judgment is 'not only as to every matter which was \n\n[245 U.S. 520, 527]\n\u00a0\n offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.' Cromwell v. County of Sac, supra, \n94 U.S. 352\n. Is the rule applicable to the instant case?\n We have set forth the proceedings in divorce in which, we have seen, there were charges of cruelty, and countercharges. There was display of property, prayers for divorce and a prayer in addition, on the part of defendant in error, that her husband, Bates, be required to restore a sum borrowed from her, 'and that the court award her such alimony as the facts and law warrant, and all other proper and necessary relief.'\n Responding to the issues thus made and the relief thus prayed, the court adjudged plaintiff in error guilty of cruelty, granted defendant in error a divorce, and awarded her the sum of '$5,111.00 in full of alimony and all other items set forth in the cross-bill.'\n There were then presented the issues of divorce and alimony; the first was made absolute, the second in a specified sum 'in full,' and the sum adjudged to her was made a lien on his property in the state (Arkansas ). We may remark that she was awarded other property. It would seem, therefore, that there is no uncertainty upon the face of the record and that it is clear as to the issues submitted and clear as to the decision upon them.\n But it is answered that: (1) The court had no jurisdiction of the Nebraska lands; and (2) that besides it did not take them into account in its judgment.\n\n 1. \nCounsel make too much of this point. It may be that the Arkansas court had no jurisdiction of the Nebraska lands so as to deal with them specifically, but it had jurisdiction over plaintiff in error to require him to perform any order it might make. But even this power need not be urged. The court had jurisdiction of the controversy between the parties and all that \n\n[245 U.S. 520, 528]\n\u00a0\n pertained to it, jurisdiction to determine the extent of the property resources of plaintiff in error and what part of them should be awarded to defendant in error. It was not limited to any particular sum if it had jurisdiction to render a money judgment at all.\n But such jurisdiction does not exist, the Supreme Court of Nebraska decides and counsel urges. The argument to sustain this is that the Arkansas statute1 (section 2684, Kirby's Digest) provides that when a divorce is granted to the wife the only power the court possesses is to restore to the parties respectively the property one may have obtained from the other during the marriage and adjudge to the wife one-third of her husband's personal property ab olutely and one-third of all the lands whereof he was seised of an estate of inheritance at any time during the marriage for her life unless she shall have relinquished the same in legal form. In other words, against a guilty husband the courts of Arkansas were without power to render a money judgment for alimony, but were confined to an allotment of his personal property and real estate in the proportions stated. But the court was confronted with the question of the relation of that section to section 2681 of the Digest, which provides that:\n'When a decree shall be entered, the court shall make such order touching the alimony of the wife and care of the children, if there be any, as from the circumstances of the parties and the nature of the case shall \n\n[245 U.S. 520, 529]\n\u00a0\n be reasonable.'\n\n In answer to the question the court decided that the latter section is applicable only when a divorce is granted for the fault of the wife.\n Plaintiff in error contests the conclusion and strong argument may be made against it to show that the sections are reconcilable and each applicable to particular conditions. And such was the view of the dissenting members of the court. However, we are not called upon for a definitive decision on account of the view we entertain of proposition 2 and the reason which, we think, induced the court to render a money judgment.\n\n 2. \nThis proposition is based on the record, which, the Supreme Court said, 'shows that the court [Arkansas court] did not in fact make any allowance on account of the Nebraska lands,' and resort is had to parol testimony for the purpose of limiting the decree. But we cannot give the testimony such strength. It is conflicting. It consists of the impressions of opposing counsel and of the parties of the opinion of the court orally delivered in direction for the decree.\n The Bodie version is supported by the clerk of the court, whose recollection was that the court did not take into consideration 'the land outside of Benton county.' But he further testified:\n That there was testimony of the rental value of the Nebraska lands and that 'the chancellor announced that, while he did not have jurisdiction over the lands in Nebraska, he did have jurisdiction over the person of Bates, as he was personally present in court. The court required Bates to deposit security for the payment of the alimony awarded. ... As I recollect it, the decree rendered was on the consent of Bates on condition that Bodie would not appeal.'\n On the Bates side is the evidence of the chancellor, whose opinion was the subject of the testimony of the others. He was specific and direct, and the following, in summary, is his testimony: Depositions were intro- \n\n[245 U.S. 520, 530]\n\u00a0\n duced showing the value of and cental income from the Nebraska lands, which were supposed to be in the name of Bates' children or in his name as trustee for his children. The decree for alimony was a lump sum of $5,111 'in lieu of any interest that she might have or claim she might have for any sum.' (It does not appear from what this is a quotation-probably from the witness' opinion.) He, the witness, intimated what he would do in the way of a property finding and the parties agreed upon a lump sum as a final settlement, from which no appeal was to be taken. His view was that the court had jurisdiction of the parties, and held it had not of the land in Nebraska, but it did have jurisdiction to consider its value in determining the amount of alimony. Knowing, as he testified, the law, he did not think he stated that there was no law justifying the court to take into consideration the Nebraska lands. It was not the first time the proposition had been raised before him.\n He remembered that Bodie claimed $2,500 as borrowed money, but the money had merged in Bates' estate. He did not understand that it entered in the decree. It was a lump sum agreement provided cash could be got to end the controversy both as to divorce and as to property rights. Counsel adjusted it on the outside, for he was quite sure that it was not th amount the court indicated it would allow. The court understood that counsel on both sides agreed to the amount; that the judgment was a complete and amicable settlement between the parties of all property rights involved.\n We must ascribe to the representation of the decree the same judicial impartiality that induced its rendition and the representation was circumstantial, without material qualification, doubt, or hesitation. It accords besides with the issues in the case and the decree. As we have seen, the amount it awarded was 'in full of alimony and all other demands set forth in the cross-bill.' \n\n[245 U.S. 520, 531]\n\u00a0\n It also recited that it was rendered by consent of plaintiff on condition that no appeal be taken by defendant from the judgment and decree. The amount was secured, as the chancellor declared he would secure it; it was paid as it was required to be paid.\n The evidence, therefore, confirms the face of the decree and that it was rendered by consent of the parties. It is admitted that consent would give jurisdiction to the court to render a money judgment for alimony.\n We think, therefore, that due faith and credit required by the Constitution of the United States was not given to the decree.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'And where the divorce is granted to the wife, the court shall make an order that each party be restored to all property not disposed of at the commencement of the action which either party obtained from or through the other during the marriage and in consideration or by reason thereof; and the wife so granted a divorce against the husband shall be entitled to one-third of the husband's personal property absolutely, and one-third of all the lands whereof her husband was seised of an estate of inheritance at any time during the marriage for her life, unless the same shall have been relinquished by her in legal form.'

Hayden, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Thompson, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Bethlehem Steel Company entered into a contract, dated September 27, 1909, with the United States to manufacture and deliver for the Navy large quantities of several groups of armor plates, and agreed to replace any accepted \n\n[246 U.S. 523, 524]\n\u00a0\n armor which should prove defective within six months after it had been fastened on the ship. The contract required the company to furnish a bond with sureties in a sum equal to ten per cent. of the total cost of all groups, and provided that 'at the end of each calendar year the amount of said bond may be reduced to correspond to the estimated cost of armor then undelivered.' The bond was furnished; and delivery of all the armor originally specified was completed May 2, 1911. But on March 26, 1912, plates aggregating at cost prices more than the penalty of the bond were found to be defective, and a part of his was not replaced until November 22, 1912. On January 27, 1912, the company formally requested the Secretary of the Navy to cancel the bond and notify the surety, but he refused to do so except upon certain conditions which were not complied with until May 15, 1912, when the bond was canceled. The company had expended $5,509.62 in payment of premiums on the bond from May 3, 1911, until May 15, 1912, and demanded reimbursement by the government. Payment being refused, suit was brought in the Court of Claims to recover this amount and also a balance of $3,170.69 for plate delivered. Judgment for the latter sum was entered; but the court held that the company was not entitled to recover for the premiums paid. The case comes here under section 242 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [ Comp. St. 1916,  1219]).\n The lower court held that the bond covered merely the original delivery of the armor plate and not the replacement of defective plates; but it refused recovery of the amount paid for premiums after May 3, 1911, on the ground that the payment thereof was voluntary, because the condition of the bond had then been complied with. The government contends that the bond covered the replacement also; that the contract made reduction of the bond permissive, not mandatory; and that the Secretary was, in any event, under no obligation to cancel the \n\n[246 U.S. 523, 525]\n\u00a0\n bond prior to the request made January 27, 1912. We have no occasion to consider any of these contentions. It nowhere appears that the company had bound itself to continue to pay premiums until the Secretary canceled the bond and gave the surety notice thereof. So far as disclosed by the record, the payment of premiums was voluntary.\n The judgment of the Court of Claim is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA dissents. \n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBILBY v.

Probate was denied on the last ground; and the proponents appealed to the district court where, as provided by the state law, it was tried de novo. That court after an advisory verdict of a jury, denied probate solely on the ground of mental incapacity; and the errors assigned in the Supreme Court were substantially, that the judgment of the dis- \n\n[246 U.S. 255, 257]\n\u00a0\n trict court was against the evidence. 153 Pac. 1173. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and a petition for rehearing was denied without a statement of reasons. No federal question had been raised in the district court, nor apparently up to that time in the Supreme Court. But an application was then made for leave to file a second petition for rehearing; and in it proponents set up, among others, the claim that because Bruner was full-blood Creek Indian 'the execution of said will and the legal effect thereof and the necessity or nonnecessity of the probation of said will is thereby involved in this cause and presents federal questions.' We need not, however, consider this contention.

U S(1918)\nNo. 98\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 231, 232]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry S. Robbins, of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n Mr. G. Carroll Todd, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 231, 235]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Chicago is the leading grain market in the world. Its Board of Trade is the commercial center through which most of the trading in grain is done. The character of the organization is described in Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., \n198 U.S. 236\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 637. Its 1600 members include brokers, commission merchants, dealers, millers, \n\n[246 U.S. 231, 236]\n\u00a0\n maltsters, manufacturers of corn products and proprietors of elevators. Grains there dealt in are graded according to kind and quality and are sold usually 'Chicago weight, inspection and delivery.' The standard forms of trading are: (a) Spot sales; that is, sales of grain already in Chicago in railroad cars or elevators for immediate delivery by order on carrier or transfer of warehouse receipt. (b) Future sales; that is, agreements for delivery later in the current or in some future month. (c) Sales 'to arrive'; that is, agreements to deliver on arrival grain which is already in transit to Chicago or is to be shipped there within a time specified. On every business day sessions of the Board are held at which all bids and sales are publicly made. Spot sales and future sales are made at the regular sessions of the Board from 9:30 a. m. to 1:15 p. m., except on Saturdays, when the session closes at 12 m. Special sessions, termed the 'call,' are held immediately after the close of the regular session, at which sales 'to arrive' are made. These sessions are not limited as to duration, but last usually about half an hour. At all these sessions transactions are between members only; but they may trade either for themselves or on behalf of others. Members may also trade privately with one another at any place, either during the sessions or after, and they may trade with nonmembers at any time except on the premises occupied by the Board. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Purchases of grain 'to arrive' are made argely from country dealers and farmers throughout the whole territory tributary to Chicago, which includes besides Illinois and Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, and even South and North Dakota. The purchases are sometimes the result of bids to individual country dealers made by telegraph or telephone either during the sessions or after; but most pur- \n\n[246 U.S. 231, 237]\n\u00a0\n chases are made by the sending out from Chicago by the afternoon mails to hundreds of country dealers, offers to buy at the prices named, any number of carloads, subject to acceptance before 9:30 a. m. on the next business day.\n In 1906 the Board adopted what is known as the 'call' rule. By it members were prohibited from purchasing or offering to purchase, during the period between the close of the call and the opening of the session on the next business day, any wheat, corn, oats or rye 'to arrive' at a price other than the closing bid at the call. The call was over, with rare exceptions, by 2 o'clock. The change effected was this: Before the adoption of the rule, members fixed their bids throughout the day at such prices as they respectively saw fit; after the adoption of the rule, the bids had to be fixed at the day's closing bid on the call until the opening of the next session.\n In 1913 the United States filed in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, this suit against the Board and its executive officers and directors, to enjoin the enforcement of the call rule, alleging it to be in violation of the Anti-Trust Law of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209. The defendants admitted the adoption and enforcement of the call rule, and averred that its purpose was not to prevent competition or to control prices, but to promote the convenience of members by restricting their hours of business and to break up a monopoly in that branch of the grain trade acquired by four or five warehousemen in Chicago. On motion of the government the allegations concerning the purpose of establishing the regulation were stricken from the record. The case was then heard upon evidence; and a decree was entered which declared that defendants became parties to a combination or conspiracy to restrain interstate and foreign trade and commerce 'by adopting, acting upon and enforcing' the 'call' rule; and enjoined them from* act- \n\n[246 U.S. 231, 238]\n\u00a0\n ing upon the same or from adopting or acting upon any similar rule.\n No opinion was delivered by the District Judge. The government proved the existence of the rule and described its application and the change in business practice involved. It made no attempt to show that the rule was designed to or that it had the effect of limiting the amount of grain shipped to Chicago; or of retarding or accelerating shipment; or if raising or depressing prices; or of discriminating against any part of the public; or that it resulted in hardship to any one. The case was rested upon the bald proposition, that a rule or agreement by which men occupying positions of strength in any branch of trade, fixed prices at which they would buy or sell during an important part of the business day, is an illegal restraint of trade under the Anti-Trust Law. But the legality of an agreement or regulation cannot be determined by so simple a test, as whether it restrains competition. Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be att ined, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences. The District Court erred, therefore, in striking from the answer \n\n[246 U.S. 231, 239]\n\u00a0\n allegations concerning the history and purpose of the call rule and in later excluding evidence on that subject. But the evidence admitted makes it clear that the rule was a reasonable regulation of business consistent with the provisions of the Anti-Trust Law.\n First. The nature of the rule: The restriction was upon the period of price-making. It required members to desist from further price-making after the close of the call until 9:30 a. m. the next business day; but there was no restriction upon the sending out of bids after close of the call. Thus it required members who desired to buy grain 'to arrive' to make up their minds before the close of the call how much they were willing to pay during the interval before the next session of the Board. The rule made it to their interest to attend the call; and if they did not fill their wants by purchases there, to make the final bid high enough to enable them to purchase from country dealers.\n Second. The scope of the rule: It is restricted in operation to grain 'to arrive.' It applies only to a small part of the grain shipped from day to day to Chicago, and to an even smaller part of the day's sales; members were left free to purchase grain already in Chicago from any one at any price throughout the day. It applies only during a small part of the business day; members were left free to purchase during the sessions of the Board grain 'to arrive,' at any price, from members anywhere and from nonmembers anywhere except on the premises of the Board. It applied only to grain shipped to Chicago; members were left free to purchase at any price throughout the day from either members or non-members, grain 'to arrive' at any other market. Country dealers and farmers had available in practically every part of the territory called tributary to Chicago some other market for grain 'to arrive.' Thus Missouri, Kansas, Ne- \n\n[246 U.S. 231, 240]\n\u00a0\n braska and parts of Illinois are also tributary to St. Louis;Nebraska and Iowa, to Omaha; Minnesota, Iowa, South and North Dakota, to Minneapolis or Duluth; Wisconsin and parts of Iowa and of Illinois, to Milwaukee; Ohio, Indiana and parts of Illinois, to Cincinnati; Indiana and parts of Illinois, to Louisville.\n Third. The effects of the rule: As it applies to only a small part of the grain shipped to Chicago and to that only during a part of the business day and does not apply at all to grain shipped to other markets, the rule had no appreciable effect on general market prices; nor did it materially affect the total volume of grain coming to Chicago. But within the narrow limits of its operation the rule helped to improve market conditions thus:\n\n\n (a)\n It created a public market for grain 'to arrive.' Before its adoption, bids were made privately. Men had to buy and sell without adequate knowledge of actual market conditions. This was disadvantageous to all concerned, but particularly so to country dealers and farmers.\n\n\n (b)\n It brought into the regular market hours of the Board sessions, more of the trading in grain 'to arrive.'\n\n\n (c)\n It brought buyers and sellers into more direct relations; because on the call they gathered together for a free and open interchange of bids and offers.\n\n\n (d)\n It distributed the business in grain 'to arrive' among a far larger number of Chicago receivers and commission merchants than had been the case there before.\n\n\n (e)\n It increased the number of country dealers engaging in this branch of the business; supplied them more regularly with bids from Chicago; and also increased the number of bids received by them from competing markets.\n\n\n (f)\n It eliminated risks necessarily incident to a private market, and thus enabled country dealers to do business on a smaller margin. In that way the rule made it possible for them to pay more to farmers without raising the price to consumers. \n\n[246 U.S. 231, 241]\n\u00a0\n (g) It enabled country dealers to sell some grain to arrive which they would otherwise have been obliged either to ship to Chicago commission merchants or to sell for 'future delivery.'\n\n\n (h)\n It enabled those grain merchants of Chicago who sell to millers and exporters, to trade on a smaller margin and by paying more for grain or selling it for less, to make the Chicago market more attractive for both shippers and buyers of grain.\n\n\n (i)\n Incidentally it facilitated trading 'to arrive' by enabling those engaged in these transactions to fulfill their contracts by tendering grain arriving at Chicago on any railroad, whereas formerly shipments had to be made over the particular railroad designated by the buyer.\n The restraint imposed by the rule is less severe than that sustained in Anderson v. United States, \n171 U.S. 604\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 50. Every Board of Trade and nearly every trade organization imposes some restrainst upon the conduct of business by its members. Those relating to the hours in which business may be done are common; and they make a special appeal where, as here, they tend to shorten the working day or, at least, limit the period of most exacting activity. The decree of the District Court is reversed with directions to dismiss the bill.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] There is an exception as to future sales not here material. \n\n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOLDT v. PENNSYLVANIA R. CO.(1918)\nNo. 62\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 441, 442]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry W. Brush, of Buffalo, N. Y., Rufus S. Day, of Washington, D. C., Frank Gibbons, of Buffalo, N. Y., and Charles W. Dille, of Cleveland, Ohio, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney and J. S. Flannery, both of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.\n At Buffalo, N. Y., defendant has a yard where freight trains are made up. Cars under control of a brakeman descend by gravity to desired positions on connecting tracks which lie southward of the 'hump' or high point. A rule forbade employes from going between cars without first taking precautions not observed in the present case. Some evidence tended to show that under longcontinued practice, considered good railroading, cars (in 'strings' or 'cuts') were constantly sent down and purposely allowed to strike others with sufficient force to secure coupling, but not hard enough to injure the equipment, 'regardless of the position the men are in, putting them under obligation to take care of themselves.' \n\n[245 U.S. 441, 443]\n\u00a0\n While between cars, contrary to instructions, and assisting in an effort to adjust a faulty coupler, Edward J. Boldt, an experienced yard conductor, was killed. The coupler was at the south end of a 'string' standing on an inclined switch. Another 'string' moving down from the north hit the standing one violently and drove it against deceased and across a space of 20 feet.\n Suing under the federal Employers' Liability Act, plaintiff maintained that the brakeman in control negligently permitted the moving cars to strike with too great violence; also that the company engligently failed to promulgate and enforce adequate rules to safeguard deceased while occupied about his task; and some evidence tended to support both claims. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment upon verdict for defendant after the trial court had denied motion for new trial based solely upon its refusal to give the charge specially requested by plaintiff and copied below. 218 Fed. 367, 134 C. C. A. 175.\n To the general charge plaintiff made no objection whatever. In the first paragraph it declared:\n'The foundation for the action is the Employers' Liability Act, which was passed by Congress in the year 1908, and which substantially provides that, if the employes of interstate railway carriers are injured while at work, on account of the negligence of the employer, or on account of the negligence of an officer or agent, or, indeed, even on account of the negligence of a fellow servant, that a recovery can be had.'\n\n Continuing, it explained nature of the accident, relationship, responsibilities, and obligations of parties, definition and effect of contributory negligence, etc.\n Concerning assumption of risk, the court said:\n'Evidence has been given by other witnesses that customarily cars are sent over this 'leader' into the yard of the defendant, and into the railroad yards of other railroad companies, ad libitum; that is, they are sent freely, one after another, to classify them and to make up trains when \n\n[245 U.S. 441, 444]\n\u00a0\n already classified; they are defined as 'live tracks,' a dangerous place to work, gentlemen, and workmen who take upon themselves occupations of that character assume the ordinary risks of the employment; they assume the risks that are incident to the particular avocation.' 'The decedent, as I have already stated, was bound to take care, and exercise diligence, and avoid any accidents from the movements of the cars in the yards and while at work. A railroad company, gentlemen, does not guarantee or insure the safety of its employes; it is merely obliged to use ordinary care to prevent unusual risks by the decedent, which, under the circumstances, and the manner in which the work was ordinarily done, could not be reasonably anticipated.' 'You must be satisfied, gentlemen, in order to give her an award, that it is due to her because of the negligence of the defendant railroad company, and, if you also believe that it was due to the negligence of the decedent himself, who was engaged in a risky occupation, he, as I asid before, assumed the ordinary risks of his employment, then you may apportion the damages.'\n\n At defendant's request and without objection, the jury were told:\n'That the decedent assumed the obvious necessary risks of the employment in which he was engaged.'\n\n Plaintiff then asked a charge that:\n'The risk the employe now assumes, since the passage of the federal Employers' Liability Act, is the ordinary dangers incident to his employment, which does not now include the assumption of risk incident to the negligence of defendant's officers, agents, or employes.'\n\n Denying the request the court said:\n'Under the Employers' Liability Act the employe simply assumes the risk of his employment.

St. 1916,  8660] reads, 'Such employe shall not be held to have assumed the risk of his employment in any case where a violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted \n\n[245 U.S. 441, 445]\n\u00a0\n for the safety of employes contributed to the injury, or death of such employe.' I decline to charge as requested, because this is not an action of the kind specified in section 4.'\n\n This denial is the only error properly assigned here; and the circumstances afford no reason for departing from the general rule which limits our consideration to it.\n Section 1, Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65 (Comp. St. 1916,  8657), declares:\n That carriers 'shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed,' etc., 'resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employes of such carrier, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other equipment.'\n In cases within the purview of the statute the carrier is no longer shielded by the fellow-servant rule, but must answer for an employes negligence as well as for that of an officer or agent.\n In Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 503\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 635, 639 (58 L. Ed. 1062, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475), we said:\n'It seems to us that section 4, in eliminating the defense of assumption of risk in the cases indicated, quite plainly evidences the legislative intent that in all other cases such assumption shall have its former effect as a complete bar to the action.' Jacobs v. Southern R. R. Co., \n241 \nU.S. 229, 235\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 588.\n\n At common law the rule is well settled that a servant assumes extraordinary risks incident to his employment or risks caused by the master's negligence which are obvious or fully known and appreciated by him. Shearman & Redfield on Negligence (6th Ed.)  208; Bailey, Personal Injuries (2d Ed.)  385. This general doctrine was clearly recognized in Gila Valley Ry. Co. v. Hall, \n232 \nU.S. 94, 101\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 229; Jacobs v. Southern R. R. Co., supra; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. De Atley, \n241 \nU.S. 310, 313\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 564; and Erie R. R. Co. v. Purucker, \n244 \nU.S. 320, 324\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 629. \n\n[245 U.S. 441, 446]\n\u00a0\n The request in question did not accurately state any applicable rule of law and was properly refused. Already the jury had been told that deceased assumed the ordinary risks of his employment-a statement more favorable than plaintiff could properly demand. The risk held to have been assumed in the Horton Case certainly arose from negligence of some officer, agent, or employe; and if the negligence of all these should be excluded in actions under the Employers' Liability Act, it is difficult to see what practical application could ever be given in them to the established doctrine concerning assumption of risk.\n The judgment below is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice DAY took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOSTON & M R R v. PIPER(1918)\nNo. 208\nArgued: Decided: April 15, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 439, 440]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edwin W. Lawrence, of Rutland, Vt., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 439, 441]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Marvelle C. Webber, of Rutland, Vt., for defendant in error. \n\n[246 U.S. 439, 442]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by Piper against the Boston & Maine Railroad to recover damages for loss occasioned by delay in delivering cattle as a result of the company's negligence. The plaintiff recovered damages and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Vermont. 90 Vt. 176, 97 Atl. 508.\n The plaintiff shipped the cattle upon paying the reduced rate for shipment thereof under the Uniform Live Stock Agreement containing, among other things, the following:\n'The same has been received by said carrier for itself and on behalf of connecting carriers for transportation subject to official tariffs, classifications and rules of the said company and upon the following terms and conditions which are admitted and accepted by the said shipper as just and reasonable. ... That in the event of any unusual delay or detention of said live stock caused by the negligence of said carrier or its employes or its connecting carriers or their employes or otherwise the said shipper agrees to accept as full compensation for all loss or damage sustained thereby the amount actually expended by said shipper in the purchase of food and water for said stock while so detained. ... And E. G. Piper does hereby acknowledge that he had the option of shipping the above-described live stock at a higher rate of freight according to the official tariffs, classifications and rules of the said carrier and connecting carriers and thereby receiving the security of the liability of the said carrier and connecting railroad and transportation companies as common carriers of the said live stock upon their respective roads and lines, but has voluntarily decided to ship same under this contract at the reduced rate of freight above first mentioned.'\n\n The tariffs in effect at the time the shipment moved \n\n[246 U.S. 439, 443]\n\u00a0\n provided for a rate of $42 when the Uniform Live Stock Agreement was signed and that:\n'Live stock will be taken at the reduced rates fixed in the tariff only when a uniform live stock contract is executed by the station agent and the consignor, and when the release on the back of said contract is executed by man or men who are to accompany said live stock. If consignor refuses to execute a uniform live stock contract, the live stock will be charged ten (10) per cent. higher than the reduced rates specified herein provided, that in no case shall such higher charge be less than one (1) per cent. per one hundred pounds.'\n\n The company's tariffs were duly filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and contained a copy of the Uniform Live Stock Contract as above set forth.\n Interstate shipments of the character here in contr versy made upon bills of lading, and under tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, have been the subject of frequent consideration in this court. The binding character of the stipulations of the bill of lading and of the rates as fixed in the filed tariffs, have been recognized and enforced. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Starbird, Adm'r, \n243 U.S. 592\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 462, and previous cases in this court therein cited.\n The Carmack Amendment (Comp. St. 1916,  8604a, 8604aa) requires the initial carrier to issue a bill of lading, and carriers are obliged to carry the articles shipped at the rates fixed in the published tariffs. Many decisions of this court have held that the carrier may offer to the shipper and the shipper may be bound by a contract which limits recovery to a valuation declared by the shipper in consideration of the reduced rate for the carriage of the freight. This rule was stated in an early case arising after the passage of the Carmack Amendment. Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, \n226 \nU.S. 491, 509\n, 510 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 148, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 257, and has been frequently reiterated since.\n In the cases in which the recovery for the lesser valu- \n\n[246 U.S. 439, 444]\n\u00a0\n ation has been affirmed, the shipper was offered an opportunity to recover a greater sum than the declared value upon paying a higher rate to the carrier. The shipper was offered alternative recoveries based upon different valuations upon the payment of different rates, and was held bound by the one chosen. Such contracts of shipment this court has held not to be in contravention of the settled principles of the common law preventing a carrier from contracting against liability for losses resulting from its own negligence, and are lawful limitations upon the amount of recovery binding upon the shipper upon principles of estoppel. Hart v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n112 U.S. 331\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 151, followed and approved since the passage of the Carmack Amendment in Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 148, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 257, supra, and see Wells Fargo & Co. v. Neiman-Marcus Co., \n227 U.S. 469\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 267; Kansas Southern R. Co. v. Carl, \n227 U.S. 657\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 391; Chicago, R. I. & Pacific R. Co. v. Cramer, \n232 U.S. 490\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 383; Boston & Maine R. Co. v. Hooker, \n233 U.S. 97\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 526, L. R. A. 1915B, 450, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 593; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Robinson, \n233 U.S. 173\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 556. Furthermore it has been held that a low valuation will not prevent the application of the rule making the agreement binding upon the shipper. Pierce Co. v. Wells Fargo & Co., \n236 \nU.S. 278, 285\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 351.\n While the rule of the lesser recovery based upon lesser rates, when the shipper has been given the option of higher recovery upon paying a higher rate has been held binding upon the shipper so long as the published tariff remains in force, this court has not held a bill of lading containing a limitation against liability for loss caused by the carrier's negligence, such as is here involved, to be conclusive of the shipper's right to recover. In the previous decisions of this court upon the subject it has been said that the limited valuation for which a recovery may be had does not permit the carrier to defeat recovery because of losses arising from its own negligence but serves \n\n[246 U.S. 439, 445]\n\u00a0\n to fix the amount of recovery upon an agreed valuation made in consideration of the lower rate stipulated to be paid for the service.\n In the bill of lading, now under consideration, there is an express agreement limiting liability from unusual delay and detention, caused by the carrier's negligence, to the amount actually expended by the shipper in the purchase of food and water for his stock while so detained. This stipulation contravenes the principle that the carrier may not exon rate itself from losses negligently caused by it, and is not within the principle of limiting liability to an agreed valuation which has been made the basis of a reduced freight rate. Such stipulations as are here involved are not legal limitations upon the amount of recovery, but are in effect attempts to limit the carrier's liability for negligence by a contract which leaves practically no recovery for damages resulting from such negligence. While this provision was in the bill of lading, the form of which was filed with the railroad company's tariffs with the Interstate Commerce Commission, it gains nothing from that fact. The legal conditions and limitations in the carrier's bill of lading duly filed with the Commission are binding until changed by that body (Kansas Southern Ry. v. Carl, \n227 \nU.S. 639, 654\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 391); but not so of conditions and limitations which are, as is this one, illegal, and consequently void.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Vermont, and the same is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOSTON STORE OF CHICAGO v. AMERICAN GRAPHOPHONE CO.(1918)\nNo. 363\nArgued: January 16, 1918Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 8, 9]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter Bachrach, Hamilton Moses, and Joseph W. Moses, all of Chicago, Ill., for Boston Store of Chicago.\n Messrs. Elisha K. Camp, of New York City, Daniel N. Kirby, of St. Louis, Mo., James M. Beck, of New York City, and Taylor E. Brown and Clarence E. Mehlhope, both of Chicago, Ill., for American Graphophone Co.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 8, 16]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The court below, before whom this case is pending, desiring instruction to the end that the duty of deciding the cause may be performed, has certified certain facts and propounded questions for solution arising therefrom. The certificate as to some matters of procedure is deficient in specification and looked at from the point of view of the questions which it asks is somewhat wanting in precision. As, however, the matters not specified are not in dispute and the want of precision referred to is not so fundamental as to mislead or confuse, we are of opinion the duty rests upon us to answer the questions and we come to discharge it, making the statements, however, which we have made as an admonition concerning the duty not to be negligent and ambiguous but to be careful \n\n[246 U.S. 8, 17]\n\u00a0\n and* precise in preparing certificates as the basis for questions propounded to obtain our instruction.\n Without in any degree changing, we rearrange and somewhat condense the case as stated in the certificate. The American Graphophone Company, a West Virginia corporation, as assignee of certain letters patent of the United States was the sole manufacturer of Columbia graphophones, grafonolas, records and blanks, and the Columbia Graphophone Company, also a West Virginia corporation, was the general agent of the American Company for the purpose of marketing the devices above stated.\n'The American Company, acting through its agent, the Columbia Company, employs in the marketing of its phonographic records and its other products a system of price maintenance, by which system it has been its uniform practice to cause its agent, the Columbia Company, to enter into ... contracts ... in the name of the Columbia Company, with dealers in phonographic records, located in the United States and its territorial possessions, to whom the American Company delivers its product, through the Columbia Company, by which it is provided, in part, that in consideration of the prices at which prescribed quantities of the various said products of the American Company are agreed to be delivered to such dealer, the dealer, in turn, obligates himself or itself in selling such products to adhere strictly to and to be bound by and not to depart from the official list prices promulgated from time to time by the Columbia Company for said products, and further expressly covenants not in any way to dispos of any such products at less than such list prices. The American Company fixes and prescribes the prices of its said products, and said contracts when entered into cover all such products of the American Company which may thereafter from time to time be acquired by such dealers from the Columbia Company, without \n\n[246 U.S. 8, 18]\n\u00a0\n any new express price restriction contract being entered into at the time when each order for goods subsequent to the entering into of said contract is placed or filled by said dealers.\n\n'In pursuance of said price maintenance system the Columbia Company, acting under said instructions and as the agent of the American Company, entered into [such] contracts with over five thousand dealers in phonographic records located in the United States and its territorial possessions.'\n\n The Boston Store, an Illinois corporation established at Chicago, dealt with the American Company through its agent, the Columbia Company, conformably to the system of business which was carried out as above stated. The contract evidencing these dealings, which was typical of those by which the business system was carried on was entered into in October, 1912, and contained the following clauses:\n'No Jobbing Privileges Extended under This Contract.\n\n'Notice to Purchasers of 'Columbia' Graphophones, Grafonolas, Records, and Blanks.\n\n'All 'Columbia' Graphophones, Grafonolas, Records and blanks are manufactured by the American Graphophone Company under certain patents and licensed and sold through its sole sales agent the Columbia Phonograph Company (General), subject to conditions and restrictions as to the persons to whom and the price at which they may be resold by any person into whose hands they come. Any violation of such conditions or restrictions make the seller or user liable as an infringer of said patents.\n\n'After reading the foregoing notice and in consideration of current dealers' discounts given to me\/us by the Columbia Phonograph Company ( General) I\/we hereby \n\n[246 U.S. 8, 19]\n\u00a0\n agree to take any Columbia product received by me\/us from said company, either directly or though any intermediary, under the conditions and restrictions referred to in said notice and to adhere strictly and be bound by the official list prices established from time to time by said company and that I\/we will neither give away, sell, offer for sale, nor in any way dispose of such goods, either directly or through any intermediary, at less than such list prices, nor induce the sale of such goods by giving away or reducing the price of other goods, nor sell or otherwise dispose of any of said goods, directly or indirectly, outside of the United States, and I\/we understand that a breach of this agreement will amount to an infringement of said patents and subject me\/us to a suit and damages therefor. I\/We admit the validity of all patents under which said product is manufactured and hereby covenant and agree not to question or contest the same in any manner whatsoever. I\/We further understand and agree that this license extends the right to market said Columbia product from the below mentioned address only, and that a separate contract is required to market said product from a branch store or stores, or through an agent or agencies at any other point.\n\n'I\/We acknowledge the receipt of a duplicate of the foregoing notice and contract and that no representations or guarantees have been made by the salesman on behalf of said company which are not herein expressed. I\/We also acknowledge receipt of the official list prices on all Columbia product in force at the date hereof.'\n\n This contract contained a note specifying large rates of discount from the list prices for purchases made under its terms, and contained a reference to other lists of net prices covering particular transactions and to the 'current Columbia catalogues for list prices on machines, records and supplies.'\n Under this contract at the time and also subsequent to \n\n[246 U.S. 8, 20]\n\u00a0\n its making the Columbia Company delivered to t e Boston Store at Chicago a number of graphophones and appliances made by the American Company at the sums fixed in the contract as above stated. This suit arose from a disregard by the Boston Store of the rule as to maintenance of price fixed in its contract, that is, from selling the articles at a less price than that which the contract stipulated should be maintained and the bill was filed against the Boston Store by the American and Columbia Companies to enjoin the alleged violations of the contract. While the certificate is silent as to the averments of the bill, in the argument it is stated and not disputed that it was based on a right to make the contract for the maintenance of prices in and by virtue of the patent laws of the United States and the resulting right under such laws to enforce the agreement as to price maintenance as part of the remedy given by the patent law to protect the patent rights of the American Company. The court enjoined the Boston Store as prayed from disregarding the terms of the contract as to price maintenance. (D. C.) 225 Fed. 785. On appeal the court below made the certificate previously stated and propounded four questions for our decision.\n In a general sense the questions involve determining whether the right to make the price maintenance stipulation in the contract stated and the right to enforce it were secured by the patent law, and if not, whether it was valid under the general law, and was within the jurisdiction of the court on the one hand because of its authority to entertain suits under the patent law or its power on the other to exercise jurisdiction because of diversity of citizenship. We at once say, despite insistence in the argument to the contrary that we are of opinion that there is no room for controversy concerning the subjects to which the questions relate, as every doctrine which is required to be decided in answering the questions is now \n\n[246 U.S. 8, 21]\n\u00a0\n no longer open to dispute as the result of prior decisions of this court, some of which were announced subsequent to the making of the certificate in this case. Under this situation our duty is limited to stating the results of the previous cases, to briefly noticing the contentions made in argument concerning the nonapplicability of those results to the case in hand, and then to applying to the questions the indisputable principles controlling the subjects which the questions concern. As, however, the discharge of these duties as to each and all of the questions will require a consideration of the cases to be applied, it must result that if the questions be primarily considered separately, reiteration concerning the decided cases will inevitably take place. To avoid this redundancy of statement we therefore at once as briefly as we may, state the adjudged cases which are applicable in order that in the light afforded by one statement concerning them the questions may be considered and answered.\n In Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, \n210 U.S. 339\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 722, it was settled that the exclusive right to vend a copyrighted book given by the copyright law did not give to the owner of the copyright and book the right to sell for a price satisfactory to him and by a notice placed in the book fix a price below which it should not be sold by all those who might subsequently acquire it; and that as such a right was not secured by the copyright law or the remedies which it afforded, a court of the United States had no jurisdiction to afford relief on the contrary theory.\n In Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., \n220 U.S. 373\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 376, it was decided that under the general law the owner of movables (in that case, proprietary medicines compounded by a secret formula) could not sell the movables and lawfully by contract fix a price at which the product should afterwards be sold, because to do so would be at one and the same time to sell and retain, to part with and yet to hold, to project the will of the seller so as to cause \n\n[246 U.S. 8, 22]\n\u00a0\n it to control the mo able parted with when it was not subject to his will because owned by another, and thus to make the will of the seller unwarrantedly take the place of the law of the land as to such movables. It was decided that the power to make the limitation as to price for the future could not be exerted consistently with the prohibitions against restraint of trade and monopoly contained in the Anti-Trust Law.\n In Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., \n224 U.S. 1\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 364, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 880, it was held that the owner of a patented machine (a rotary mimeograph) and the patents which covered it had in selling the same a right to contract with the purchaser not to use materials essential for working it unless bought from the seller of the machine and to qualify the condition as a license of the use; that this right included the further right by notice on the machine of the contract to affect a third person who might deal with the purchaser with knowledge of the contract and notice so as to make him liable as a contributory infringer if he dealt with the buyer in violation of the terms of the notice. It was further decided that the right to make such contract arose from the right conferred by the patent law and that jurisdiction to enforce it as against the contributory infringer existed under that law. At the time this case was decided there was one vacancy on the bench and one member of the court was absent. There was division, four members concurring in the ruling which the court made and three dissenting.\n Bauer v. O'Donnell, \n229 U.S. 1\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 616, L. R. A. (N. S.) 1185, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 150, again involved the right of a seller to impose a restraint on the price of future sales. It arose on a certificate from the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia asking whether the right asserted was within the monopoly conferred by the patent law and whether therefore the duty to enforce it under that law obtained and the power to give the remedy sought as a means of preventing an infringement of the \n\n[246 U.S. 8, 23]\n\u00a0\n patent existed. Pointing out that although the restriction on future price which the certificate stated was indisputably void and unenforceable under the general law as the result of the ruling in the Miles Medical Case, supra, it was held that that ruling was not necessarily apposite because the certificate and the question presented restricted the case to determining whether the right to limit the price existed because within the monopoly granted by the patent law and whether the relief asked was within the remedy which that law afforded. Considering the case in that limited aspect, it was decided: (a) That the exclusive right to vend given by the patent law had the same significance which had been affixed to that word in the copyright law in the Bobbs-Merrill Case, supra. (b) That hence when the holder of a patented article had sold it, the article so sold passed out of the monopoly and the right to make future sales by one who bought it was not embraced by the patent law and consequently that law could not be extended so as to perpetuate its control beyond the limits to which by the operation of law it reached. In other words, the decision was that a patentee could not use and exhaust the right to sell as to which a monopoly was given him by the patent law and yet by conditions and stipulations continue that law in effect so as to make it govern things which by his voluntary act were beyond its scope. And (c) that as a result, where an article had been sold and passed beyond the monopoly given by the patent law, remedies on the theory of infringement were not applicable to acts done which could not have that character. It was hence answered that the controversy and the remedies invoked were not within the patent law. As the case dealt with the right to vend under the patent law, the court reserved any express statement concerning the scope of the right to use conferred by that law.\n In Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n243 U.S. 490\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 412, L. R. A. 1917E, 1196, \n\n[246 U.S. 8, 24]\n\u00a0\n the right to fix a permanent marketing price at which phonographs should be resold after they had been sold by the patentee was considered. Basing its action upon the substance of things, and disregarding mere forms of expression as to license, etc., the court held that the contract was obviously in substance like the one considered in the Miles Medical Co. Case and not different from the one which had come under review in Bauer v. O'Donnell. Thus brushing away disguises resulting from forms of expression in the contract and considering it in the light of the patent law, it was held that the attempt to regulate the future price or the future marketing of the patented article was not within the monopoly granted by the patent law in accordance with the rule laid down in Bauer v. O'Donnell.\n The general doctrines, although presented in a different aspect, were considered in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Manufacturing Co., \n243 U.S. 502\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 416, L. R. A. 1917E, 1187. The scope of the case will be at once made manifest by the two questions which were certified for solution:\n'First. May a patentee or his assignee license another to manufacture and sell a patented machine and by a mere notice attached to it limit its use by the purchaser or by the purchaser's lessee, to films which are no part of the patented machine, and which are not patented? Second. May the assignee of a patent, which has licensed another to make and sell the machine covered by it, by a mere notice attached to such machine, limit the use of it by the purchaser or by the purchaser's lessee to terms not stated in the notice but which are to be fixed, after sale, by such assignee in its discretion?'\n\n The case therefore directly involved the general question of the power of the patentee to sell and yet under the guise of license or otherwise to put restrictions which in substance were repugnant to the rights which necessarily arose from the sale which was made. In other words, it required once again a consid- \n\n[246 U.S. 8, 25]\n\u00a0\n eration of the doctrine which had been previously announced in Henry v. Dick and of the significance of the monopoly of the right to use conferred by the patent law which had been reserved in Bauer v. O'Donnell. Comprehensively reviewing the subject, it was decided that the rulings in Bauer v. O'Donnell and Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co. conflicted with the doctrine announced and the rights sustained in Henry v. Dick, and that case was consequently overruled. Reiterating the ruling in the two last cases it was again decided that as by virtue of the patent law one who had sold a patented machine and received the price and had thus placed the machine so sold beyond the confines of the patent law, could not by qualifying restrictions as to use keep under the patent monopoly a subject to which the monopoly no longer applied.\n Applying the cases thus reviewed there can be no doubt that the alleged price-fixing contract disclosed in the certificate was contrary to the general law and void. There can be equally no doubt that the power to make it in derogation of the general law was not within the monopoly conferred by the patent law and that the attempt to enforce its apparent obligations under the guise of a patent infringement was not embraced within the remedies given for the protection of the rights which the patent law conferred.\n Thus concluding, it becomes we think unnecessary to do more than say that we are of opinion that the attempt in argument to distinguish the cases by the assumption that they rested upon a mere question of the form of notice on the patented article or the right to contract solely by reference to such notice is devoid of merit since the argument disregards the fundamental ground upon which, as we have seen, the decided cases must rest. Moreover, so far as the argument proceeds upon the assumption of the grave disaster which must come to the holders of pat- \n\n[246 U.S. 8, 26]\n\u00a0\n ent rights and articles made under them from the future application of the doctrine which the cases establish, it must be apparent that if the forebodings are real the remedy for them is to be found not in an attempt judicially to correct doctrines which by reiterated decisions have become conclusively fixed, but in invoking the curative power of legislation. In addition, through perhaps an abundance of precaution we direct attention to the fact that nothing in the decided cases to which we have referred, having regard either to the application of the general law or of the patent law, deprives an inventor of any right coming within the patent monopoly, since the cases alone concerned whether the monopoly of the patent law can be extended beyond the scope of that law or, in other words, applied to articles after they have gone beyond its reach. The proposition so earnestly insisted upon that while this may be true, it does not fairly consider the refiex detriment to come to the rights of property of the inventor within the patent law as a result of not recognizing the right to continue to apply the patent law as to objects which have passed beyond its scope, is obviously not one susceptible of judicial cognizance. This must be since whether for the preservation of the rights which are within a law, its provisions should be extended to embrace things which it does not include typically illustrates that which is exclusive of judicial power and within the scope of legislative action.\n It remains, then, only to apply the principles established by the authorities which we have stated to the answers to the questions.\n The first question is:\n'Does jurisdiction attach under the patent laws of the United States?'\n\n As we assume under the admissions of counsel that the bill asserted the existence of rights under the patent law, and as at the time it was filed the want of merit in such assertion had not been so conclusively settled as to cause it to be frivolous, we \n\n[246 U.S. 8, 27]\n\u00a0\n are of opinion that the court had jurisdiction to pass upon the case as made by the bill, that is, to determine whether or not the suit arose under the patent law and hence as thus understood the question should be answered, Yes.\n Considering the second and third questions as virtually involving one consideration we state them together.\n'2. If so, do the recited facts disclose that some right or privilege granted by the patent laws has been violated?\n\n'3. Can a patentee, in connection with the act of delivering his patented article to another for a gross consideration then received, lawfully reserve by contract a part of his monopoly right to sell?'\n\n Correcting their ambiguity of expression by treating the questions, as they must be treated, as resting upon and deducible from the facts stated in the certificate and therefore as embracing inquiries concerning the contract of sale containing the price maintenance stipulation, it follows from what we have said that the questions must be answered in the negative.\n The final question is this:\n'4. If jurisdiction attaches solely by reason of diversity of citizenship, do the recited facts constitute a cause of action?'\n\n Upon the hypothesis which this question assumes there also can be no doubt that it must be answered in the negative.\n The first question will be certified as answered, Yes; and the second, third and fourth as answered, No.\n And it is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER are of opinion that each of the questions should be answered in the affirmative.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, concurring.\n Whether a producer of goods should be permitted to fix by contract, express or implied, the price at which the purchase may resell them, and if so, under what conditions, is an economic question. To decide it wisely it is \n\n[246 U.S. 8, 28]\n\u00a0\n necessary to consider the relevant facts, industrial and commercial, rather than established legal principles. On that question I have expressed elsewhere views which differ apparent y from those entertained by a majority of my Brethren. I concur, however, in the answers given herein to all the questions certified; because I consider that the series of cases referred to in the opinion settles the law for this court. If the rule so declared is believed to be harmful in its operation, the remedy may be found, as it has been sought, through application to the Congress or relief may possibly be given by the Federal Trade Commission which has also been applied to. \n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRADER v. JAMES(1918)\nNo. 126\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 88, 89]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. A. Blythe, of Hugo, Okl., D. M. Tibbetts, of Guthrie, Okl., and J. H. Brader, of Hugo, Okl., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 88, 91]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. M. Works, of Hugo, Okl., and Joseph C. Stone, of Muskogee, Okl., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 88, 93]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the right of Rachel James, a full-blood Choctaw Indian, to convey certain land. The land was originally allotted to Cerena Wallace under the Supplemental Agreement with the Choctaws and Chickasaws of July 1, 1902. 32 Stat. 641, c. 1362. As to the homestead allotment, which is here in question, section 12 of said agreement provided that it should be inalienable during the lifetime of the allottee, not exceeding 21 years from the date of the certificate of allotment. Cerena Wallace, mother of Rachel James, and herself a full-blood Choctaw Indian, died October 27, 1905, leaving her daugher, Rachel James, sole surviving heir at law. On August 17, 1907, Rachel James, joined by her husband, conveyed the land, embraced in the original homestead allotment with some other lands to Tillie Brader, who conveyed by quitclaim deed of September 13, 1909, to the plaintiff in error. The conveyance by Rachel James to Tillie Brader was not approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Rachel James prosecuted this suit to recover the land, and for use and occupation, thereof, basing her right of recovery on the fact that her conveyance had not been approved by the Secretary of the Interior. She succeeded in the court of original jurisdiction, and the judgment \n\n[246 U.S. 88, 94]\n\u00a0\n was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma. 49 Okl. 734, 154 Pac. 560.\n The case as brought to our attention involves two questions:\n\n\n (1)\n Could a full-blood Choctaw Indian after the passage of the Act of April 26, 1906, c. 1876, 34 Stat. 137, convey the lands inherited from a full-blood Choctaw Indian, to whom the lands had been allotted in her lifetime, without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior?\n\n\n (2)\n If such conveyance were made valid by the act of Congress only with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, is such legislation constitutional?\n As to the homestead allotment to the mother, Cerena Wallace, under the Supplemental Choctaw and Chickasaw Agreement of July 1, 1902, Rachel James as her heir at law received the land free from restriction, and had good right to convey the same unless prevented from so doing by the Act of April 26, 1906. Mullen v. United States, \n224 U.S. 448\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 494. As the conveyance here in question was subsequent to the Act of April 26, 1906, if that act covers the case, and is constitutional, Rachel James may not convey without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and the judgment below was right.\n The Act of April 26, 1906, was before this court in Tiger v. Western Investment Co., \n221 U.S. 286\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 578. In that case it was held that a full-blood Indian of the Creek Tribe after the passage of the Act of April 26, 1906, could not convey land which he had inherited, and which was allotted under the Act of Congress known as the Supplemental Creek Agreement of June 30, 1902, c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500, and as to which the five years named in section 16 of that act had not expired when Congress passed the Act of April 26, 1906, without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. In that case, as in this, a construction of section 22 of the last-named act was directly involved. That section provides:- \n\n[246 U.S. 88, 95]\n\u00a0\n 'That the adult heirs of any deceased Indian of either of the Five Civilized Tribes whose selection has been made, or to whom a deed or patent has been issued for his or her share of the land of the tribe to which he or she belongs or belonged, may sell and convey the lands inherited from such decedent; and if there be both adult and minor heirs of such decedent, then such minors may join in a sale of such lands by a guardian duly appointed by the proper United States court for the Indian Territory. And in case of the organization of a state or territory, then by a proper court of the county in which said minor or minors may reside or in which said real estate is situated, upon an order of such court made upon petition filed by guardian. All conveyances made under this provision by heirs who are full-blood Indians are to be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe.'\n The conveyance by Rachel James is within the terms of the section as construed in the Tiger Case, unless the fact that the restriction of the act under which she inherited had expired when the Act of April 22, 1906, was passed, whereas in the Tiger Case the former limitation had not expired when the act was passed, makes such difference as to require a different ruling in the present case. We are of opinion that this fact does not work a difference in result. As set forth in the opinion in the Tiger Case, the Act of April 22, 1906, was a comprehensive one, and intended to apply alike to all of the Five Civilized Tribes, and to make requirements as to conveyances by full-blood Indians and the full-blood heirs of Indians, which should take the place of former restrictions and limitations. The purpose was to substitute a new and uniform scheme controlling alienation in such cases, operating alike as to all the Civilized Tribes. Notwithstanding Rachel James might have conveyed the homestead allotment after it descended to her, she was a tribal Indian, and as such \n\n[246 U.S. 88, 96]\n\u00a0\n still subject to the legislation of Congress enacted in discharge of the nation's duty of guardianship over the Indians. Congress was itself the judge of the necessity of legislation for this purpose; it alone might determine when this guardianship should cease.\n The argument that the language in the last sentence of section 22 must be taken to mean that Congress had no intention to deal with restrictions under former acts, certainly not with those which had expired, is answered by the consideration that Congress was dealing with tribal Indians, still under its control and subject to national guardianship. In the terms of this act Congress made no exception as to rights of alienation which had arisen under former legislation, and it undertook, as we held in the Tiger Case, to pass a new and comprehensive act requiring conveyances, of the class herein under consideration, to be valid only when approved by the Secretary of the Interior.\n In view of the repeated decisions of this court we can have no doubt of the constitutionality of such legislation. While the tribal relation existed the national guardianship continued, and included authority to make limitations upon the ights which such Indians might exercise in respect to such lands as are here involved. This authority did not terminate with the expiration of the limitation upon the rights to dispose of allotted lands; the right and duty of Congress to safeguard the rights of Indians still continued. It has been frequently held by this court that the grant of citizenship is not inconsistent with the right of Congress to continue to exercise this authority by legislation deemed adequate to that end. It is unnecessary to again review the decisions of this court which support that authority. Some of them were reviewed in the Tiger Case. The doctrine is reiterated in Heckman v. United States, \n224 U.S. 413\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 424, and United States v. Nice, \n241 \nU.S. 591, 598\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 696. \n\n[246 U.S. 88, 97]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff in error relies upon Choate v. Trapp, \n224 U.S. 665\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 565, in which this court sustained a contractual exemption as to taxation of certain Indian lands. In that case the right of exemption was based upon a valid and binding contract, and that decision in no wise militates against the right of Congress to continue to pass legislation placing restrictions upon the right of Indians to convey lands allotted as were those in question here. In United States v. First National Bank, \n234 U.S. 245\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 846, and United States v. Waller, \n243 U.S. 452\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 430, this court dealt with lands as to which certain mixed-blood Indians by act of Congress had been given full ownership with all the rights which inhere in ownership in persons of full legal capacity. Those decisions do not place limitations upon the right of Congress to deal with a tribal Indian whose relation of ward to the government still continues, and concerning whom Congress has not evidenced its intention to release its authority.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, and the same is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROGAN v. NATIONAL SURETY CO.(1918)\nNo. 171\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 257, 258]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John A. Cline, of Cleveland, Ohio, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John M. Garfield and Thomas H. Hogsett, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 257, 259]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action against the surety on a bond given under the Act of August 13, 1894, c. 280, 28 Stat. 278, as amended by the Act of February 24, 1905, c. 778, 33 Stat. 811 (Comp. St. 1916,  6923). The claim of Brogan, an intervening petitioner, was allowed by the District Court; but the judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and judgment entered against him upon the undisputed facts (National Surety Co. v. United States, 228 Fed. 577, 143 C. C. A. 99, L. R. A. 1917A, 336). The case comes here on writ of error under section 241 of the Judicial Code ( Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [Comp. St. 1916,  1218]). \n\n[246 U.S. 257, 260]\n\u00a0\n The facts undisputed or as found by the lower court and accepted by the Court of Appeals were these: The Standard Contracting Company undertook to deepen the channel in a portion of St. Mary's river, Michigan, located 'in a comparative wilderness at some distance from any settlement. There were no hotels or boarding houses' and the contractor 'was compelled to provide board and lodging for its laborers.' Groceries and provisions of the value of $4,613.87 furnished it by Brogan, were used by the contractor in its boarding house; and were supplied 'in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract and the bond upon which this suit is based. They were necessary to and wholly consumed in such work.' The number of men employed averaged 80. They were 'boarded' partly on the dredges, partly in tents supplied by the contractor; all under an arrangement made with the labor unions-by which the contractor was to board the men and deduct therefor $22.50 a month from their wages. The contract and the bond executed by the National Surety Company bound the contractor to 'make full payment to all persons supplying him with labor or materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in' the contract.\n The supplies furnished by Brogan under these circumstances were clearly used in the prosecution of the work, just as supplies furnished for the soldiers' mess are used in the prosecution of war. In each case the relation of food to the work in hand is proximate. But the surety contends that the words 'in the prosecution of' the work are not used in the bond and the act in their natural sense, but should be given a conventional meaning so as to exclude labor and materials which contribute to construction only indirectly, as do the supplies consumed by a contractor in operating his plant. In support of this position, attention is called to the fact that while the Act of 1894 provided that the bond should have 'the additional \n\n[246 U.S. 257, 261]\n\u00a0\n obligation that such contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them labor and materials in the prosecution of the work,' and that suit might be brought and recovery had upon this bond by any person who had supplied 'labor or materials for the prosecution of such work,' the Act of 1905 specified that recovery could be had by the persons who had 'furnished labor or materials used in the construction or repair' of the work. But the change in phraseology is not significant. The purpose of the amendment was merely to secure to the United States preference over others in the satisfaction of its claim against the contractor. Illinois Surety Co. v. Peeler, \n240 \nU.S. 214, 218\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 321. See Report of Committee on H R. 13,626, 58th Congress, Second Session, No. 2360. It was pointed out in Mankin v. Ludowici-Celadon Co., \n215 \nU.S. 533, 538\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 174, 176 (54 L. Ed. 315) that 'in respect to the condition of the bond required to be given, the language of the amended act is precisely the same as that contained in the act of August 13, 1894'; and in Hill v. American Surety Co., \n200 \nU.S. 197, 201\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 168, 169 (50 L. Ed. 437) that 'in respect to the persons entitled to the benefit of the bond there has been no material change in the act.' Illinois Surety Co. v. Peeler, supra, 240 U. S. p. 224, 36 Sup. Ct. 321, 60 L. E . 609.\n This court has repeatedly refused to limit the application of the act to labor and materials directly incorporated into the public work. Thus in Title Guaranty & Trust Co. v. Crane Co., \n219 \nU.S. 24, 34\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 140, the claims for which recovery was allowed under the bond included not only cartage and towage of material, but also claims for drawings and patterns used by the contractor in making molds for castings which entered into the construction of the ship. In United States Fidelity Co. v. Bartlett, \n231 U.S. 237\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 88, where the work contracted for was building a breakwater, recovery was allowed for all the labor at a quarry opened 50 miles away. This included, as the record shows, the labor not only of men who stripped the earth \n\n[246 U.S. 257, 262]\n\u00a0\n to get at the stone and who removed the debris, but carpenters and blacksmiths who repaired the cars in which the stone was carried to the quarry dock for shipment, and who repaired the tracks upon which the cars moved. And the claims allowed included also the wages of stablemen who fed and drove the horses which moved the cars on those tracks. In Illinois Surety Co. v. John Davis Co., \n244 U.S. 376\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 614, recovery was allowed not only for the rental of cars, track and other equipment used by the contractor in facilitating his work, but also the expense of loading this equipment and the freight paid thereon to transport it to the place where it was used. As shown by these cases, the act and the bonds given under it, must be construed liberally for the protection of those who furnish labor or materials in the prosecution of public work.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals deemed immaterial the special circumstances under which the supplies were furnished and the findings of fact by the trial court that they were necessary to and wholly consumed in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract and bond. In our opinion these facts are not only material, but decisive. They establish the conditions essential to liability on the bond. The bare fact that the supplies were furnished to the contractor and were consumed by workmen in its employ would have been immaterial. A boarding house might be conducted by the contractor (like some company stores concerning which states have legislated, Keokee Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 U.S. 224\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 856) as an independent enterprise undertaken solely in order to utilize the opportunity for separate and additional profit afforded by the congregation of many laborers in the particular locality where the public work is being performed. The laborers might resort to such a boarding house in the exercise of individual choice in the selection of an eating place. Under such circumstances the furnishing of supplies would clearly be a matter independent of the work provided for in the \n\n[246 U.S. 257, 263]\n\u00a0\n contract and would not entitle him who had furnished the groceries used in the boarding house to recover on the bond. But here, according to the undisputed facts and the findings of the trial court, the furnishing of board by the contractor was an integral part of the work and necessarily involved in it. Like the supplying of coal to operate engines on the dredges, it was indispensable to the prosecution of the work, and it was used exclusively in the performance of the work. Groceries furnished to a contractor under such circumstances and consumed by the laborers, are materials supplied and used in the prosecution of the public work. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, Mr. Justice PITNEY, and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, dissent. \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBUCKEYE POWDER CO. v.

Button, of New York, City, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.\n This is an action brought by the plaintiff in error to recover triple damages under the Sherman Act, July 2, 1890, c. 647,  7, 26 Stat. 209, 210 (Comp. St. 1916.  8829). There was a trial that lasted five months, in which the facts were shown at great length, and after a very full and fair charge by the presiding judge the jury found a verdict in favor of the principal defendant, the E. I. Dupont de Nemours Powder Company, on the merits and for the other two by direction of the Court. Elaborate exceptions were taken but they were overruled by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 223 Fed. 881, 139 C. C. A. 319.\n The first one that we shall deal with complains of the Court's sustaining a motion at the end of the trial that the plaintiff should elect whether it would rely upon the \n\n[248 U.S. 55, 61]\n\u00a0\n first or the second section of the Sherman Act (Comp. St. 1916,  8820, 8521). If the case were different the question presented might be grave. In the one before the Court the only error was in the use of the word election and the implied admission that the trial possibly could be taken not to have proceeded upon the second section of the Act, coupled of course with section 7, giving a private action to persons injured by breach of the statute. The first section deals with contracts in restraint of trade, the second with monopolizing and attempting to monopolize it. The declaration, after stating the organization of the plaintiff in January, 1903, for the purpose of manufacturing and selling powder, particularly black blasting powder, alleges a long previous conspiracy on the part of various companies to monopolize the trade in explosives, which ended in the organization of the E. I. Dupont de Nemours Powder Company in May, 1903, in order more completely to carry out that end, It is alleged that the defendants and others have carried out that end, and that in pursuance of it they did acts, detailed at great length, for the purpose of compelling the plaintiff to join them or else go out of business. That, with an allegation that they succeeded and forced the plaintiff to sell out at a loss, is the whole scope of the declaration. There was a motion to strike it out for duplicity, but the motion was overruled on the ground that the declaration was as we have stated. (D. C.) 196 Fed. 514. The trial proceeded on that footing without complaint. So far as contracts bore upon the supposed attempt to subject plaintiff to the monopoly the jury was allowed to consider them. The case was fully tried upon the ground taken by the plaintiff at the outset and the only one on which it could hope to succeed. The plaintiff did not ask to amend. It is unnecessary to advert to the statement of the judge that in his opinion the exception to be considered should have the whole record behind it, or whether, as has been suggested, the \n\n[248 U.S. 55, 62]\n\u00a0\n second section is not the only one addressed to transactions such as were alleged. Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197, 404\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 436. When the plaintiff, after the ruling of the judge, went through the form of electing to rely upon acts done contrary to section 2 of the statute, it simply adhered to the interpretation of its declaration that it had accepted at the beginning and had endeavored to sustain throughout. Portions of the charge are criticised in this connection for pointing out to the jury that section 2 embraced not only monopoly but attempts to monopolize. But this was wholly to the plaintiff's advantage, as it explained that if the plaintiff was driven out of business by the defendant's acts it was entitled to recover if those acts were done in the course of an attempt to monopolize, whether or not they were crowned with success. It allowed the jury to consider everything that indicated such an attempt.\n Next in importance is an exception to the Court's directing a verdict in favor of the Eastern Dynamite Company and the International Smokeless Powder and Chemical Company. There were no acts done by either of these companies that were aimed at the plaintiff. The only substantial ground for charging them was that if they were parties to a conspiracy as alleged they became responsible for the acts of the Dupont Company as their own. As the jury exonerated the latter company this ground fails. So that even if the ruling was wrong it did no harm unless something more can be found in the case. Portland Gold Mining Co. v. Stratton's Independence, 158 Fed. 63, 85 C. C. A. 393, 16 L. R. A. (N. S.) 677. The ruling did not import that there was no evidence against the Dupont Company, the case against which was put fairly to the jury, but that there was no evidence that the other defendants conspired with it, so far at least as the plaintiff was concerned. These companies did not make black blasting powder and had no interest immediately adverse to the plaintiff. \n\n[248 U.S. 55, 63]\n\u00a0\n The basis of the charge of conspiracy affecting the black blasting powder business was that the Dupont Company directly or through another company was interested in their stock. No ohter is suggested in the declaration and it would be hard to extract any act from the evidence. Certainly none could be found that was more than an infinitesimal fraction of those done by the Dupont Company. Here again the Court was of opinion that the exceptions to be considered should have the whole record behind it, but on the record as it stands we think it sufficiently appears that the plaintiff suffered no real harm.\n The next matter requires but a few words. The plaintiff offered in evidence decrees in a proceeding by the Government finding the Dupont Company guilty under the Sherman Act of an attempt to monopolize. United States v. E. I. Dupont de Nemours & Co. (C. C.) 188 Fed. 127. These of course were held inadmissible. The Court also ruled that the statute of limitations barred recovery for any damage suffered before September 18, 1905, six years before the beginning of the present suit. The plaintiff now contends that the Clayton Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323,  5, 38 Stat. 731 (Comp. St. 1916,  8835e) making admissible such criminal judgments 'hereafter rendered,' in some way should effect our decision upon a ruling made years before, and that by virtue of the same section the running of the statute of limitations was suspended retrospectively as to claims already barred, pending the Government suit. These matters do not need more than a statement of what was argued and what was done.\n Another exception seems to us over critical. Mr. Waddell, the organizer of the plaintiff corporation and chief witness on its behalf, started it directly after leaving the Dupont Company, with which he had been for many years. He knew all the elements of the situation before he embarked on the venture, and did not do so until the Dupont Company had reached the height of its power. The judge remarked in his charge that the plaintiff did \n\n[248 U.S. 55, 64]\n\u00a0\n not stand like a competitor that had been in existence while the defendant's influence was being developed and that had been injured in its business during the course of such development-that the mere existence of the defendant's power as it was when the plaintiff was born was not in itself a cause of action to the plaintiff, but that the plaintiff must show that the defendant uses it power oppressively, if not against the plaintiff, at least in the course of defendant's business. This was innocuous truth. The plaintiff could not be called into being in order to maintain a suit for conduct that made it not pay to be born. Claims for such antenatal detriments are not much favored by the law. See National Council, United American Mechanics v. State Council of Virginia, \n203 \nU.S. 151, 161\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 46.\n Another statement in the charge concerning Mr. Waddell's knowledge of the defendant's power and policy is complained of, but the complaint seems to us based upon a perversion of its meaning. The defendant had put in evidence tending to show that Mr. Waddell organized the plaintiff merely to sell it out to the defendant, without any real intent to compete. The Court said that of course Mr. Waddell had a right to go into business and that this motive was of little moment so far as that was concerned, but that it might have a bearing on the question whether the plaintiff was sufficiently capitalized to meet normal conditions, adding that it did not matter whether it was or not as against a competition forced upon it by unlawful means. This is treated as if it had made the motive an answer to the claim. What it really did was to state correctly that, on the question whether the plaintiff's failure was due to the defendant's oppresion or to the plaintiff's incapacity, the jury in estimating the evidence and finding what the facts were might consider Mr. Waddell's motive if they should find it to have been what the defendants alleged.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that it is not \n\n[248 U.S. 55, 65]\n\u00a0\n necessary to deal specifically with all the details brought up by the dragnet of the plaintiff's exceptions and assignments of error, sixty-nine in number and occupying more than sixty pages of the record. Central Vermont Ry. Co. v. White, \n238 \nU.S. 507, 508\n, 509 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 865, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 252. Several exceptions were taken to the exclusion of statements by third persons of their reasons for refusing or ceasing to do business with the plaintiff. We should be slow to overthrow a judgment on the ground of either the exclusion or admission of such statements except in a very strong case. But the exclusion in this instance was proper. The statement was wanted not as evidence of the motives of the speakers but as evidence of the facts recited as furnishing the motives. Lawlor v. Loewe, \n235 \nU.S. 522, 536\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 170; Elmer v. Fessenden, 151 Mass. 359, 362, 24 N. E. 208, 5 L. R. A. 724. In view of the finding of the jury the rulings as to damages are immaterial and need no discussion here. The defendant put in evidence tending to show that its conduct was not the cause of the plaintiff's failure and its evidence, or the weakness of the plaintiff's prevailed. Our conclusion upon the whole case is that the plaintiff has had a fair trial and that the judgment should not be disturbed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCAMPBELL v. WADSWORTH(1918)\nNo. 72\nArgued: Decided: December 16, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 169, 170]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. Dale Wolfe, of Wewoka, Okl., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Samuel Herrick, of Washington, D. C., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendants in error brought suit to quiet title to the lands in controversy in this case, the facts involved being agreed upon as follows:\n Louis Cox, whose name appears in the final rolls of the Seminole Tribe of Indians, died intestate, on July 4, 1901, and left surviving him the defendants in error, Annie Cox, his widow, now Annie Wadsworth, and two daughters, Maggie Cox, now Maggie Beamore, and Nancy Cox, now Nancy Alexander. These three women were all duly enrolled on the Creek tribal roll in 1890, and in July, 1901, after the death of Cox, upon an application made in May, 1901, they were enrolled as citizens of the Creek Nation by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, but neither of the three appears on the Seminole rolls. Certified copies of the 'final' Seminole roll bearing the name of Louis Cox and of the Creek roll bearing the names of his wife and daughters are in the record. On the former is the notation 'Wife and family Creeks,' and in the latter Louis Cox is described as an enrolled Seminole.\n No allotment of land had been made to Cox at the time of his death, but subsequently the land in controversy was allotted by the United States as his distributive share of the Seminole tribal lands.\n The plaintiff in error claims title through one Lucy Wildcat, the only surviving relative of Cox whose name apears on the approved Seminole roll. The widow and daughters claim as heirs of Louis Cox.\n The decision of the case depends upon the application to the facts thus stated of the second paragraph of the \n\n[248 U.S. 169, 171]\n\u00a0\n agreement between the government of the United States and the Seminole Tribe of Indians, dated October 7, 1899, and ratified by Act of Congress June 2, 1900 (31 Stat. 250, c. 610), the essential parts of which are as follows:\n'First. That the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, in making the rolls of Seminole citizens, pursuant to the Act of Congress approved June twenty-eighth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, shall place on said rolls the names of all children born to Seminole citizens up to and including the thirty-first day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, and the names of all Seminole citizens then living; and the rolls so made, when approved by the Secretary of the Interior, as provided by said Act of Congress, shall constitute the final rolls of Seminole citizens, upon which the allotment of lands and distribution of money and other property belonging to the Seminole Indians shall be made, and to no other persons.\n\n'Second. If any member of the Seminole tribe of Indians shall die after the thirty-first day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety- nine, the lands, money, and other property to which he would be entitled if living, shall descend to his heirs who are Seminole citizens, according to the laws of descent and distribution of the state of Arkansas, and be allotted and distributed to them accordingly: Provided, that in all cases where such property would descend to the parents under said laws the same shall first go to the mother instead of the father, and then to the brothers and sisters, and their heirs, instead of the father.'\n\n Plainly the facts agreed upon bring the case within the scope of the second paragraph thus quoted, and whether Lucy Wildcat, the only surviving Seminole relative of the deceased, or the wife and daughters of Cox, inherited the land in controversy depends upon the effect to be given to the phrase, 'shall descend to his heirs who are Seminole Indians.' \n\n[248 U.S. 169, 172]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court of Oklahoma seemingly had little difficulty in concluding that this expression excluded 'heirs' who were not Seminoles and it adopted unanimously as its own the opinion by the Commission (154 Pac. 60), which found in favor of the plaintiff in error, containing the following:\n'The act under consideration says that such property 'shall descend to his heirs who are Seminole citizens.' Who are Seminole citizens as here designated? Section 1 of the act set out above provides for the enrollment of the Seminole citizens and says that in making out this roll the names of all citizens living on the 31st day of December, 1889, and all the children born to Seminole citizens up to that date, shall constitute the final rolls of Seminole citizens. In section 21 of the Original Curtis Act (Act Cong. June 28, 1898, c. 517, 30 Stat. 502), which provided for the enrollment of the citizens of the Five Civilized Tribes, which included the Seminole Nation, there is a provision which reads as follows:\n\n\"The rolls so made, when approved by the Secretary of the Interior, shall be final, and the persons whose names are found thereon, with their descendants thereafter born to them, with such persons as may intermarry according to the tribal laws, shall alone constitute the saveral tribes which they represent.'\n\n'From the reading of these two sections last above set out it plainly appears that neither the widow of decedent, Louis Cox, nor their two children, can be denominated 'Seminole citizens.' The widow undoubtedly is not so included because she is of the Creek blood and a citizen of that tribe, and the two children are excluded because they were born before December 31, 1899, and were not enrolled as Seminole citizens, and thus do not come within the provisions defining Seminole citizens.'\n\n But upon a rehearing of the case the court 'withdrew' its former opinion and held that Congress intended that \n\n[248 U.S. 169, 173]\n\u00a0\n the words 'Seminole citizens' in the second paragraph of the act should have a more elastic meaning than was in terms given to them in the first paragraph and, by interpreting them so as to include the wife and daughters of the deceased, it found the title to the lands to be in the latter subject to the dower estate of the former.\n This judgment, being within the provisions of section 2 of the Act approved September 6, 1916 (39 Stat. 726, c. 448), amending section 237 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156 [Comp. St. 1916,  1214]), is properly before us for review on writ of error.\n The first paragraph of the argeement, which we have quoted, prescribes the persons whose names shall go upon the Seminole roll and it declares that the rolls os made, when approved by the Secretary of the Interior, 'shall constitute the final rolls' of 'Seminole citizens' and that to these 'and to no other persons' shall allotment of property be made. This definition of 'Seminole citizens' is followed in the second paragraph with the provision that the property of an intestate, such as we have in this case, shall descend to his heirs who are 'Seminole citizens.'\n There is nothing in the act to indicate an intention on the part of Congress or of the tribe that the words, 'Seminole citizens,' as used in the second, shall have any other meaning than that specifically given to them in the first paragraph but, on the contrary, both the natural and the legal inference from their being used in such juxtaposition is that the same meaning shall be given them and that if a different or more comprehensive meaning had been intended it would have been expressed.\n But there are other cogent reasons why courts should not modify these final rolls by liberal interpretation of this statutory provision.\n The rolls of the Seminole Tribe were compiled by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, a quasi judicial tribunal, to which large powers were given by statute for \n\n[248 U.S. 169, 174]\n\u00a0\n that specific purpose, and the action of the Commission, when approved by the Secretary of the Interior, made 'final' by the statute, so conclusively settles all questions within its jurisdiction as to membership in the tribe and as to the rights of the Indians to tribal property, that they are subject to attack, as the judgments of courts are, only for fraud and mistake-of which there is no suggestion in this record. United States v. Wildcat, \n244 U.S. 111\n. 37 Sup. Ct. 561\n\n\n The principal reason given by the Oklahoma Supreme Court for its second conclusion is that, the daughters of Cox being children born to a Seminole citizen prior to the 31st day of December, 1899, were entitled to enrollment as Seminole Indians under the first paragraph of the agreement and if so enrolled would be strictly within the terms of the act and would inherit the land.\n We think it very clear that this reason is not sound.\n The Seminole Tribe was derived from the Creek, and the tribal customs and traditions of the two had much in common. While this record does not show specifically what the tribal custom of the Seminoles was with respect to tribal recognition of children born of mixed marriages, it does show definitely that by the Creek Indians, and it is with enrolled Creek Indians that we are dealing, the children of mixed marriages were treated and enrolled as members of the tribe of their mother, for the names of the daughters of Cox are found on the tribal roll of the Creek Indians of 1890, when they were very young children, and again in 1901, when Maggie was 20 years of age and Nancy was 17, apparently on their own application, they and their mother, were placed by the Commission on the final roll of the Creek Tribe. This Creek roll also shows that the father of the children, Louis Cox, was a Seminole, and the Seminole roll on which Cox's name appears bears the notation, 'Wife and family Creeks.' Thus it is plain that it was not through any mistake or \n\n[248 U.S. 169, 175]\n\u00a0\n oversight that the children of Cox were omitted by the Commission from the Seminole roll and were placed upon the Creek roll, but that this was done for the sufficient reason that tribal custom and tradition required their enrollment as Creeks, and the law nowhere provided for their enrollment in more than one tribe. The final rolls, alike of the Seminoles and of the Creeks, thus made up by the Commission, were placed by the Act of Congress, as we have seen, beyond amendment by the courts on such a record as we have here, and it is impossible for us to conclude that the daughters of Cox were entitled to enrollment as members of the Seminole Tribe, or that having been enrolled as Creeks they may now be given the rights of enrolled ' Seminole citizens.'\n The Supreme Court also says that 'only the most powerful and impelling reasons' could induce it to hold that it was the intention of the Indians to exclude their own children from participation in the distribution of their property after death.\n While it is true that it seems unnatural for the Indians to have preferred more distant relatives to their own children in providing for the descent and distribution of their property, yet from the terms of the act before us, and also from the provisions of the Supplemental Creek Agreement that 'only citizens of the Creek Nation, male and female, and their Creek descendants shall inherit the lands of the Creek Nation' (Act June 30, 1902, c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500), it is clear that with the Indians the interests of the tribe were paramount to those of the family and it was with a knowledge of the mode of life of their primitive people, better and more intimate than the courts can now command, that they determined that this paramount purpose would best be served by giving to children born of mixed marriages the tribal status of their mother.\n As we have said, this record does not show affirmatively that the Seminoles had a custom similar to this one of \n\n[248 U.S. 169, 176]\n\u00a0\n the Creeks, but such is believed to have been the fact. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma, in its first opinion (154 Pac. 60), said:\n'The defendants have presented the additional proposition here that, according to the custom of the Seminole Nation, the blood of the mother determined the tribe to which her offspring belonged, and the fact that the children, plaintiffs here, were not enrolled as Seminole citizens was not due to any neglect of the parents of the said children or of the Commission to have said children enrolled on the Seminole roll, but the law and the custom of the Seminole Tribe were that the children were of the blood of the mother and members of that tribe to which the mother belonged. While we do not find it necessary to pass upon this proposition, and will leave it, as far as this opinion is concerned, an open question, yet we will say that as far as our investigation has led us, we are of the opinion that this last proposition is a correct statement of the law so far as it applies to the facts as presented in the case at bar.'\n\n In Hughes Land Co. v. Bailey, 30 Okl. 194, 196, 120 Pac. 290, the same court, in discussing the rights of two daughters born of the marriage of a Creek man to a Seminole woman, said:\n'By virtue of the citizenship of their mother, they [the daughters] were enrolled as citizens of the Seminole Nation.'\n\n And it may be noted that this custom prevails with the Seminole Indians of Florida, from whom those of Oklahoma are derived. Annual Report, Bureau of American Ethnology, 1883-84, p. 508. But the most persuasive evidence of this custom is, that the federal Commissioners, with, as we have seen, all of the facts as to parentage before them and considered, enrolled the daughters of Cox in the Creek Tribe of their mother and not in the Seminole Tribe of their father. The Commissioners, in making up the rolls which were to be 'final,' were given authority to consult tribal records and rolls \n\n[248 U.S. 169, 177]\n\u00a0\n and 'to adopt any other means deemed necessary to enable them to make up the rolls' (30 Stat. 495,  21), and in their conclusion, arrived at after many years of experience and painstaking investigation, may well be found a cogent and impelling reason for accepting the terms of the statutory agreement as they are plainly written and for refusing to enlarge them by interpretation.\n On its surface this case is typical of those hard cases which proverbially make bad law, but in reality, since the widow and children of Cox, as enrolled Creeks, were entitled each to an allotment in the Creek lands and property (30 Stat. 495,  21; Act March 1, 1901, c. 676, 31 Stat. 861,  3, 28; and 32 Stat. 500,  7, 8 and 9) their being excluded from an inheritance which they did not attempt to claim for a dozen years after the death of Cox, does not present a degree of hardship calling for a strained interpretation of a plain statutory provision limiting inheritances to enrolled Seminole citizens, so that it may include not only persons not so enrolled, but persons who were actually enrolled as Creek citizens.\n The conclusion we are announcing is consonant with prior holdings of this court under similar statutes. Thus, in Washington v. Miller, \n235 U.S. 422\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 119, under the proviso in the supplemental Creek Agreement of June 30, 1902 (32 Stat. 500), that 'only citizens of the Creek Nation, male and female, shall inherit lands of the Creek Nation,' a judgment was affirmed, holding the grantee of a Creek mother entitled, as against the claims of a Seminole father, to lands inherited from the child of their marriage enrolled as a Creek, when, if the father had been an enrolled Creek, he and the mother would have shared the land equally.\n And in McDougal v. McKay, \n237 U.S. 372\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 605, again under the Supplemental Creek Agreement, it was decided that the Creek father of a child born of his marriage with a non-Creek mother, inherited the entire estate of the child, \n\n[248 U.S. 169, 178]\n\u00a0\n which died intestate, although his wife would have taken equally with him had she been an enrolled Creek.\n All statutes of descent and distribution are arbitrary expressions of the purpose of the lawmaking power and that the provisions of such a statute do not happen to meet the notions of justice of a court is not sufficient reason for indulging in an interpretation which modified their plain and unambiguous terms. Especially is this true of these Indian statutes which are a progressive development, embodying concessions to tribal custom and tradition necessary to be made in order to accomplish a practical, though perhaps not an ideal, dissolution of the tribal relation and distribution of the tribal property.\n The rights of this Creek mother cannot rise higher than those of her daughters.\n It results that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCARNEY v. CHAPMAN(1918)\nNo. 281\nArgued: May 1, 1918Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Kirby Fitzpatrick, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. W. C. Duncan, of Ada, Okl., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the defendant in error J. C. Chapman to recover possession of certain land and to have his title quieted against the claims of Lottie Carney, the plaintiff in error, and of the Albersons, the other defendants in error. The right of possession is immaterial now, but there was a judgment quieting the title of the plaintiff against the above named parties which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State and in which error is alleged by Lottie Carney. The land was allotted to John Alberson, a Chickasaw Indian, who was averred by the plaintiff to \n\n[247 U.S. 102, 103]\n\u00a0\n be the lawful son of Charles Puiler, a Chickasaw, and Louisa James, an Indian woman. She died and later Alberson died leaving Puller his sole heir, if Puller was married as alleged. Puller conveyed to the plaintiff. The defendants denied the marriage and if they were right Lottie Carney is Alberson's heir.\n If any federal question is presented in the case it arises under the Act of Congress of May 2, 1890, c. 182,  38, 26 Stat. 81, 98, by which all marriages theretofore 'contracted under the laws or tribal customs of any Indian nation' located in the Indian Territory are declared valid. The date of the supposed marriage was in 1887 and therefore if it complied with the terms of the act it was validated if not valid before. The plaintiff in error, after asking instructions as to what constituted a common law marriage that were given in substance, asked for another that a common law marriage was not recognized by the Chickasaws and that a marriage of Chickasaws without a compliance with their laws was void. Taking all the requests for rulings and the rulings together we are inclined to agree with the Court below that common law marriage and marriage under the customs of the tribe were used as equivalent phrases and to assume in favor of the plaintiff in error that the request means that a marriage of Chickasaws although in accord with their customs was invalid under a Chickasaw Act of October 12, 1876, unless solemnized by a judge or ordained preacher of the Gospel. This assumption would seem to carry with it the implication that the Act of Congress did not validate a marriage in accordance with still prevailing custom if no judge or preacher added his sanction, and so to ask a constr ction of that Act that, again by implication, was refused.\n In this somewhat remote way a federal question is opened, but it cannot profit the plaintiff in error. There was some evidence that Charles Puller and Louisa James held themselves out as man and wife and were reputed \n\n[247 U.S. 102, 104]\n\u00a0\n MARRIED. THERE WAS EVIDENCE ALSO THAT IT was customARy to disregard solemnization before a judge or preacher. It would be going somewhat far to construe the Chickasaw statute as purporting to invalidate marriages not so solemnized. The Act of Congress made valid marriages under either custom or law. Whatever may be the requisites to satisfy that Act the above mentioned evidence warranted a finding that they had been complied with, as is expressly provided by statute for the case of a marriage of a white man with an Indian woman. Act of August 9, 1888, c. 818,  3, 25 Stat. 392 (Comp. St. 1916,  4105). The reason for the rule is stronger here.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHELENTIS v. LUCKENBACH S.S. CO.(1918)\nNo. 657\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 372, 373]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Silas B. Axtell and Arthur L. Burchell, both of New York City ( Fayette B. Dow, of Washington, D. C., of counsel), for petitioner.\n\n\n[247 U.S. 372, 377]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Peter S. Carter and William H. Carter, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[247 U.S. 372, 378]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In December, 1915, petitioner was employed by respondent, a Delaware corporation as fireman on board the steamship J. L. Luckenbach, which it then operated and controlled. While at sea, twenty-four hours out from New York, the port of destination, petitioner undertook to perform certain duties on deck during a heavy wind; a wave came aboard, knocked him down and broke his leg. He received due care immediately; when the vessel arrived at destination he was taken to the marine hospital, where he remained for three months; during that time it became necessary to amputate his leg. After discharge from the hospital, claiming that his injuries resulted from the negligence and an improvident order of a superior \n\n[247 U.S. 372, 379]\n\u00a0\n officer, he instituted a common-law action in Supreme Court, New York county, demanding full indemnity for damage sustained. The cause was removed to the United States District Court because of diverse citizenship. Counsel did not question seaworthiness of ship or her appliances, and announced that no claim was made for maintenance, cure, or wages. At conclusion of plaintiff's evidence the court directed verdict for respondent, and judgment thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 243 Fed. 536, 156 C. C. A. 234. The latter court said:\n'The contract of a seaman is maritime, and has written into it those peculiar features of the maritime law that were considered in the case of The Osceola [\n189 U.S. 158\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 83]; and although, because of these peculiarities, such contracts are almost invariably litigated in admiralty courts, still the contract must be the same in every court, maritime or common law. The only difference between a proceeding in one court or the other would be that the remedy would be regulated by the lex fori. If a seaman, who had been locked up or put in irons for disobedience of orders, were to sue the master for damages in a court of common law, he could not recover like a shore servant, such as a cook or chauffeur, who had received the same treatment. So a seaman, bringing suit in a common- law court for personal injuries, could recover, even if guilty of contributory negligence, although a shore servant suing in the same court could not; and a seaman suing in a common-law court for personal injuries could recover (except in the case of unseaworthiness of the vessel or failure to give proper care and medical attention) only wages to the end of the voyage and the expenses for maintenance and cure for a reasonable time thereafter, whereas in a similar case a shore servant would be entitled to recover full indemnity. Therefore, by virtue of the inherent nature of the seaman's contract, the defendant's negligence and the plaintiff's contributory negligence were totally immaterial \n\n[247 U.S. 372, 380]\n\u00a0\n considerations in this case; the sole question for the jury to determine being whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover because he had not received from the defendant his wages to the end of the voyage and the expense for his maintenance and cure for a reasonable time thereafter.\n\n'Has Congress changed the situation by section 20 of the Seamen's Act [ chapter 153, 38 Stat. 1164, 1185, Comp. St. 1916,  8337a], as the plaintiff contends? He argues that the act makes the master a fellow servant of the seaman, and therefore that Congress intended to make the relation between the seaman and all the officers throughout the same as at common law. But the Supreme Court, in the case of The Osceola, supra, while reserving the question whether the master and seaman were fellow servants, held that it made no difference whatever in respect to the liability of the shipowners for an improvident order of the master which resulted in personal injuries to the seaman . ...\n\n'It follows that whether the master and seaman are fellow servants or not is quite immaterial in the case of a suit for injuries resulting from an improvident order of the master. For this reason the court was right in directing a verdict for the defendant, and the judgment is affirmed.'\n\n In The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158, 175\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 483, 487 (47 L. Ed. 760), a libel in rem to recover damages for personal injuries to a seaman while on board and alleged to have resulted from the master's negligence, speaking through Mr. Justice Brown, we held:\n'1. That the vessel and her owners are liable, in case a seaman falls sick, or is wounded, in the service of the ship, to the extent of his maintenance and cure, and to his wages, at least so long as the voyage is continued.\n\n'2. That the vessel and her owner are, both by English and American law, liable to an indemnity for injuries \n\n[247 U.S. 372, 381]\n\u00a0\n received by seamen in consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship, or a failure to supply and keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship. Scarff v. Metcalf, 107 N. Y. 211 [13 N. E. 796, 1 Am. St. Rep. 807].\n\n'3. That all the members of the crew, except perhaps the master, are, as between themselves, fellow servants, and hence seamen cannot recover for injuries sustained through the negligence of another member of the crew beyond the expense of their maintenance and cure.\n\n'4. That the seaman is not allowed to recover an indemnity for the negligence of the master, or any member of the crew, but is entitled to maintenance and cure, whether the injuries were received by negligence or accident.'\n\n After reference to article 1,  8, and article 3,  2, of the Constitution, we declared in Souther Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205, 215\n, 216 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 524, 528 (61 L. Ed. 1086, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900):\n'Considering our former opinions, it must now be accepted as settled doctrine that, in consequence of these provisions, Congress has paramount power to fix and determine the maritime law which shall prevail throughout the country. ... And further, that in the absence of some controlling statute, the general maritime law, as accepted by the federal courts, constitutes part of our national law, applicable to matters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.'\n\n Concerning extent to which the general maritime law may be changed, modified or affected by state legislation, this was said:\n'No such legislation is valid if it contravenes the essential purpose expressed by an act of Congress, or works material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law, or interferes with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations. This limitation, at the least, is essential to the effective operation of the fundamental purposes for which such \n\n[247 U.S. 372, 382]\n\u00a0\n law was incorporated into our national laws by the Constitution itself. These purposes are forcefully indicated in the foregoing quotations from The Lottawanna,' 21 Wall. 558, 575 (22 L. Ed. 654).\n\n Among such quotations is the following:\n'One thing, however, is unquestionable; the Constitution must have referred to a system of law coextensive with, and operating uniformly in, the whole country. It certainly could not have been the intention to place the rules and limits of maritime law under the disposal and regulation of the several states, as that would have defeated the uniformity and consistency at which the Constitution aimed on all subjects of a commercial character affecting the intercourse of the states with each other or with foreign states.'\n\n The work about which petitioner was engaged is maritime in its nature; his employment was a maritime contract; the injuries received were likewise maritime and the parties' rights and liabilities were matters clearly within the admiralty jurisdiction. Atlantic Transportation Co. v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 60 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 733, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1157. And unless in some way there was imposed upon the owners a liability different from that prescribed by maritime law, petitioner could properly demand only wages, maintenance and cure. Under the doctrine approved in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, no state has power to abolish the well-recognized maritime rule concerning measure of recovery and substitute therefor the full indemnity rule of the common law. Such a substitution would distinctly and definitely change or add to the settled maritime law; and it would be destructive of the 'uniformity and consistency at which the Constitution aimed on all subjects of a commercial character affecting the intercourse of the states with each other or with foreign states.'\n Two acts of Congress are relied upon, and it is said that under each petitioner has the right to recover full indem- \n\n[247 U.S. 372, 383]\n\u00a0\n nity according to the common law. They are: (1) Section 9, Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 76, 77, whereby District Courts of the United States were given exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, 'saving to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common-law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it' (Judicial Code,  24, 256 [Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1092, 1160; Comp. St. 1916,  991(9), 1233]); and (2) section 20 of Act to Promote the Welfare of American Seamen, approved March 4, 1915, c. 153, 38 Stat. 1164, 1185, which provides:\n'That in any suit to recover damages for any injury sustained on board vessel or in its service seamen having command shall not be held to be fellow servants with those under their authority.'\n\n The precise effect of the quoted clause of the original Judiciary Act has not been delimited by this court and different view have been entertained concerning it. In Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen we definitely ruled that it gave no authority to the several states to enact legislation which would work 'material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law or interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations.' In The Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411, 431 (18 L. Ed. 397), we said:\n'That clause only saves to suitors 'the right of a common-law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it.' It is not a remedy in the common-law courts which is saved, but a common-law remedy. A proceeding in rem, as used in the admiralty courts, is not a remedy afforded by the common law; it is a proceeding under the civil law.'\n\n And in Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey, \n177 \nU.S. 638, 644\n, 648 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 824, 827 (44 L. Ed. 921):\n'Some of the cases already cited recognize the distinction between a common-law action and a common-law remedy. Thus in The Moses Taylor , ... it is said of the saving clause of the Judiciary Act: 'It is not a remedy in the common-law courts which is saved, but a \n\n[247 U.S. 372, 384]\n\u00a0\n common-law remedy.\" 'If the suit be in personam against an individual defendant, with an auxiliary attachment against a particular thing, or against the property of the defendant in general, it is essentially a proceeding according to the course of the common law, and within the saving clause of the statute ... of a common-law remedy. The suit in this case being one in equity to enforce a common- law remedy, the state courts were correct in assuming jurisdiction.'\n\n The distinction between rights and remedies is fundamental. A right is a well founded or acknowledged claim; a remedy is the means employed to enforce a right or redress an injury. Bouvier's Law Dictionary. Plainly, we think, under the saving clause a right sanctioned by the maritime law may be enforced through any appropriate remedy recognized at common law; but we find nothing therein which reveals an intention to give the complaining party an election to determine whether the defendant's liability shall be measured by common-law standards rather than those of the maritime law. Under the circumstances here presented, without regard to the court where he might ask relief, petitioner's rights were those recognized by the law of the sea.\n Section 20 of the Seamen's Act declares 'seamen having command shall not be held to be fellow servants with those under their authority,' and full effect must be given this whenever the relationship between such parties becomes important. But the maritime law imposes upon a shipowner liability to a member of the crew injured at sea by reason of another member's negligence without regard to their relationship; it was of no consequence therefore to petitioner whether or not the alleged negligent order came from a fellow servant; the statute is irrelevant. The language of the section discloses no intention to impose upon shipowners the same measure of liability for injuries suffered by the crew while at sea as the common \n\n[247 U.S. 372, 385]\n\u00a0\n law prescribes for employers in respect of their employes on shore.\n The judgment of the court below is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissent. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHENEY BROS.

Objections to the tax based on the commerce clause of the Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3), and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment were overruled by the state court. 218 Mass. 558, 106 N. E. 310. The tax was imposed under St. 1909, c. 490. pt. 3,  56, before the maximum limit was removed by St. 1914, c. 724,  1, and in that respect the case is like Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 U.S. 68\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 15, and unlike International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 U.S. 135\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 292, 62 L. Ed. --. Whether in other respects it is like Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts is the matter to be determined, and this requires that the business done by each of the seven corporations be considered. \n\n[246 U.S. 147, 153]\n\u00a0\n Cheney Brothers Company.\n This is a Connecticut corporation whose general business is manufacturing and selling silk fabrics. It maintains in Boston a selling office with one office salesman and four other salesmen who travel through New England. The salesmen solicit and take orders, subject to approval by the home office in Connecticut, and it ships directly to the purchasers. No stock of goods is kept in the Boston office, but only samples used in soliciting and taking orders. Copies and records of orders are retained, but no bookkeeping is done, and the office makes no collections. The salesmen and the office rent are paid directly from Connecticut and the other expenses of the office are paid from a small deposit kept in Boston for the purpose. No other business is done in the state.\n We do not perceive anything in this that can be regarded as a local business as distinguished from interstate commerce. The maintenance of the Boston office and the display therein of a supply of samples are in furtherance of the company's interstate business and have no other purpose. Like the employment of the salesmen, they are among the means by which that business is carried on and share its immunity from state taxation. McCall v. California, \n136 U.S. 104\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 881; Norfolk & Western R. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n136 U.S. 114\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 958; Crenshaw v. Arkansas, \n227 U.S. 389\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 294; Rogers v. Arkansas, \n227 U.S. 401\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 298. Nor is the situation changed by inferring, as the state court did, that orders from customers in Connecticut sometimes are taken by salesmen connected with the Boston office and, after transmission to and approval by the home office, are filled by shipments from the company's mill in Connecticut to such customers. In such cases it doubtless is true that the resulting sale is local to Connecticut, but the action of the Boston office in receiving the order and transmitting it to the home office partakes more of \n\n[246 U.S. 147, 154]\n\u00a0\n the nature of interstate intercourse than of business local to Massachusetts and affords no basis for an excise tax in that state. International Text Book Co. v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91, 106\n, 107 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 481, 27 L. . A. (N. S.) 493, 18 Ann. Cas. 1103. We think the tax on this company was essentially a tax on doing an interstate business and therefore repugnant to the commerce clause.\n Lanston Monotype Company.\n This is a Virginia corporation which makes typesetting machines in Philadelphia and sells them in interstate commerce. It has a place of business in Massachusetts where it keeps on hand a stock of the several parts of its machines likely to be required for purposes of repair. The stock is replenished weekly and the parts are sold extensively to those who use the machines in that and adjacent states.\n It is apparent, as we think, that a considerable portion of the business of selling and supplying the repair parts is purely local and subject to local taxation.\n Locomobile Company of America.\n This West Virginia corporation conducts an automobile factory in Connecticut and sells its automobiles in interstate commerce. It does an extensive local business in Massachusetts in repairing cars of its own make after they are sold and in use, and also in selling secondhand cars taken in partial exchange for new ones. This local business has some influence on the volume of interstate business done by the company in the state, and its abandonment would tend to reduce the purchases there of the company's automobiles. But this does not make it any the less a local business. It must be judged by what it is rather than by its influence on another business. See Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co. v. Yurkonis, \n238 \nU.S. 439, 444\n, 445 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 902. \n\n[246 U.S. 147, 155]\n\u00a0\n Northwestern Consolidated Milling Company.\n This company was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota, operates flour mills there, and sells the flour to wholesale dealers throughout the county. It has an office in Massachusetts where it employs several salesmen for the purpose of inducing local tradesmen to carry and deal in its flour. These salesmen solicit and take orders from retail dealers and turn the same over to the nearest wholesale dealer, who fills the order and is paid by the retailer. Thus the salesman, although not in the employ of the wholesaler, is selling flour for him. Of course this is a domestic business-inducing one local merchant to buy a particular class of goods from another-and may be taxed by the state, regardless of the motive with which it is conducted.\n Copper Range Company.\n This is a Michigan corporation whose articles of association contemplate that it shall have an office in Boston. It is a holding company and owns various corporate stocks and bonds and certain mineral lands in Michigan. Its activities in Massachusetts consist in holding stockholders' and directors' meetings, keeping corporate records and financial books of account, receiving monthly dividends from its holdings of stock, depositing the money in Boston banks and paying the same out, less salaries and expenses, as dividends to its stockholders three or four times a year. The exaction of a tax for the exercise of such corporate faculties is within the power of the state. Interstate commerce is not affected.\n Champion Copper Company.\n This is another Michigan corporation which maintains an office in Boston pursuant to a provision in its articles of association. It deposits the proceeds of its mining and \n\n[246 U.S. 147, 156]\n\u00a0\n smelting business in Michigan in Boston banks and, after paying salaries and expenses, distributes the balance in dividends from its Boston office. The management of its mine is under the control of a general manager in Michigan and he in turn is under the control of the company's directors. The meetings of the latter, which occur several times in a year, are held in the Boston office. At these meetings the directors receive reports from the treasurer and general manager, vote dividends, elect officers, and authorize the execution of deeds and the like for lands in Michigan. These corporate activities in Massachusetts are not interstate commerce and may be made the basis of an excise tax by that state.\n White Com any.\n This is an Ohio corporation which is conducting a business, conceded to be local, in Massachusetts. On being admitted to do business therein it acquired two pieces of land in Boston and at large cost specially improved and adapted them for use, the one as an automobile service station and the other as a garage. A subsequent change in the statute made the excise tax more onerous than before, without, as it is said, any corresponding change being made in the law relating to domestic corporations. In these circumstances the company insists that by the imposition of the tax, as defined in the statute of 1909, it is denied the equal protection of the laws, and it relies on Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, \n216 U.S. 400\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247. In overruling this objection the state court said (218 Mass. 579, 106 N. E. 319):\n'The real estate acquired by this petitioner is of a kind adapted to a very considerable and increasing business, in which there is general competition. The storage and care of automobiles and the performance of necessary service for their repair, maintenance and operation is a widespread business in which large amounts of capital \n\n[246 U.S. 147, 157]\n\u00a0\n are invested and considerable numbers of persons are engaged. Such establishments are frequent subjects for lease and sale. There is nothing to indicate or to warrant the inference that the petitioner's investment in real estate is not readily salable at reasonable prices. It is not property of a nature irretrievably devoted to a limited and monopolistic use, and not readily availably either for other valuable uses or to other persons ready to devote it to the same uses at prices fairly equivalent, subject to the general vicissitudes of business conditions, to the original investment. The Greene Case related to railroad property, which is not susceptible of use for any other purpose without great loss. In that opinion it was said: 'It must always be borne in mind that property put into railroad transportation is put there permanently. It cannot be withdrawn at the pleasure of the investors. ... The railroad must stay, and, as a permanent investment, its value to its owners may not be destroyed.\"\n\n Assenting, as we do, to what was thus said, it suffices to add, first, that a state does not surrender or abridge its power to change and revise its taxing system and tax rates by merely licensing or permitting a foreign corporation to engage in local business and acquire property within its limits, and, second, that 'a state may impose a different rate of taxation upon a foreign corporation for the privilege of doing business within the state than it applies to its own corporations upon the franchise which the state grants in creating them.' Kansas City, Memphis & Birmingham R. R. Co. v. Stiles, \n242 \nU.S. 111, 118\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 58, 61 (61 L. Ed. 176).\n Bearing in mind that the tax of which these corporations are now complaining was imposed under the statute as it stood in 1913, which was before the maximum limit was removed, it follows from our decision in Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts that the several objections based on the Constitution of the United States are all \n\n[246 U.S. 147, 158]\n\u00a0\n untenable, save in the instance of the Cheney Bros. Company. The tax on that company, as before indicated, was a tax on interstate business and therefore void under the commerce clause.\n Judgment reversed as to Cheney Bros. Company and affirmed as to the other plaintiffs in error. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO & A R. CO. v. U S(1918)\nNo. 640\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs.

A. 138, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment of the District Court against plaintiff in error for one hundred dollars, penalty for violating the Hours of Service Act (chapter 2939, 34 Stat. 1415) by permitting a switch tender to remain on duty more than nine hours. \n\n[247 U.S. 197, 198]\n\u00a0\n Section 2 of the act declares it unlawful for any interstate carrier by railroad to require or permit an employe 'actually engaged in or connected with the movement of any train' to remain on duty longer than sixteen consecutive hours:\n'Provided, That no operator, train dispatcher, or other employe who by the use of the telegraph or telephone dispatches, reports, transmits, receives, or delivers orders pertaining to or affecting train movements shall be required or permitted to e or remain on duty for a longer period than nine hours in any twenty-four hour period in all towers, offices, places, and stations continuously operated night and day, nor for a longer period than thirteen hours in all towers, offices, places, and stations operated only during the daytime, except in case of emergency, when the employes named in this proviso may be permitted to be and remain on duty for four additional hours in a twenty-four hour period on not exceeding three days in any week.'\n\n The cause was tried upon an agreed statement of facts, a jury being waived.\n Plaintiff in error's 'Yard' at Bloomington, Illinois, is seven and three-fourths miles long. During April, 1915, it maintained therein three switch shanties located upon its double track main line, one five hundred feet, another eleven hundred feet and the third a mile north or its passenger station. Trains operated over this portion of the line are under control of the yardmaster and subject to a rule which provides: 'All trains will reduce speed on passing through yard limits and proceed only after the way is seen or known to be clear.' Each of these shanties was continuously operated night and day by two men, alternately on duty therein for twelve hours during every twenty-four.\n'All of the work regularly and generally required of said employes, as well as that required on the days mentioned in said declaration, was in connection with the \n\n[247 U.S. 197, 199]\n\u00a0\n use of certain switches and telephones, which said work pertained to and affected the movements of trains of defendant engaged in interstate commerce; each of said shanties was equipped with a telephone all three being on the same circuit, and connected with the yardmaster's office' At the first shanty eight switches were handled; at the second twelve and two sets of cross-overs; at the third eight switches for south-bound trains and a cross-over one. 'The work of these employes is to throw switches, relieve yard, train and engine crews of this work, and to avoid delays to trains moving through the yard; the telephones are used to permit the yardmaster, who directs all yard movements to keep in closer touch with such movements and to issue instructions or orders to yard, train or engine crews as to the handling of cars or trains, or as to any other work that he may desire performed.' 'The telephones at the three places were installed principally for the purpose of making more convenient communication between the yardmaster's office and said shanties.'\n\n'All instructions or orders received from the yardmaster, as above set forth, were always transmitted by said employes to the engine or train crews, either verbally or by hand signals, and in no case were said employes required to write out said instructions or orders for transmission to these crews.' 'None of the service required of any of said employes on the days mentioned in said declaration was necessitated by reason of any emergency, they were the regular assigned hours of said employes, fixed in that manner by defendant's operating department which acted under instructions received from its legal department.'\n\n The purpose of the statute is to promote safety in operating trains by preventing the excessive mental and physical strain which usually results from remaining too long at an exacting task. B. & O. R. R. Co. v.* \n\n[247 U.S. 197, 200]\n\u00a0\n Interstate Commerce Commission, \n221 \nU.S. 612, 619\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 621. It must be construed and applied in view of that purpose and well- known circumstances attending the practical operation of trains.\n The individuals within the ambit of the proviso's pertinent provisions are marked by the nature of service performed-an 'operator, train dispatcher, or other employe who by the use of the telegraph or telephone dispatches, reports, transmits, receives, or delivers orders pertaining to or affecting train movements.' And the railroad is forbidden to permit one performing such service in 'towers, offices, places and stations continuously operated night and day' to remain on duty therein longer than nine hours in twenty-four. Both the post of duty and character of work are essential elements. If, in due course of his work, an employe while in any of the locations specified uses the telegraph or telephone for sending or receiving messages concerning train movements he may not lawfully remain on duty therein exceeding nine hours during any twenty- four hour period, except in case of emergency.\n Here, the facts disclose the switch tender on duty for twelve consecutive hours in a shanty continuously operated night and day where, by the use of the telephone, he received and delivered orders pertaining to train movements-not mere switching movements within the yard; and in such service mental and physical alertness are of great importance. By permitting this, the railroad violated both language and purpose of the act.\n The judgment below is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO & N W R. CO. v.

C. A. 170.\n The statute forbids an interstate railroad carrier from confining animals in cars longer than thirty-six hours, upon written request, without unloading them for rest, water and feeding 'unless prevented by storm or by other accidental or unavoidable causes which cannot be anticipated or avoided by the exercise of due diligence and \n\n[246 U.S. 512, 515]\n\u00a0\n foresight,' and subjects every such carrier 'who knowingly and willlfully fails to comply' therewith to a penalty. Admitting continuous confinement for more than thirty-six hours petitioner defended upon the ground that it was prevented from unloading within the required period by exculpatory accidental and unavoidable causes.\n It appeared: The animals were loaded at Ringsted, Iowa, 438 miles from destination-Union Stock Yards, Chicago-at 6 p. m. October 4th, and as part of a train the car containing them left Clinton, Iowa, 138 miles from Chicago, at 6 p. m. October 5th. The ordinary schedule time between the latter points is nine hours, but without increase of actual moving speed the run had been made in about six. While the train was passing through Proviso, 16 miles from destination, at 2:48 a. m. October 6th a drawbar came out and derailed a car. A delay of two hours and fifty-two minutes followed-not undue the carrier contends, but unreasonably long the government maintains. Later, at Brighton Park an air hose burst causing further delay of twenty-eight minutes. The car reached the stock yards at 9:05 a. m. October 6th-thirty-nine hours and five minutes after being loaded.\n In its charge to the jury the trial court said:\n'Your inquiry has to do with the transportation of this car of stock from the point of origin out in Iowa to destination, Union Stock Yards, and if, on the evidence in this case, you conclude that the railway company, by the exercise of due diligence, would have gotten that car of stock from the point of origin to Union Stock Yards inside of thirty-six hours, your verdict should be in favor of the United States and against the defendant, even though you should be of the opinion that these two particular things which have been made the subject of most of the contention here were properly handled by the railway company. \n\n[246 U.S. 512, 516]\n\u00a0\n 'Now, in determining this question you take into consideration the distance, among other things, the distance shown by the evidence from the point of origin to destination, what the evidence shows as to the period of time, thirty-nine hours and five minutes consumed from point of origin to destination, not merely from Clinton to Chicago, the whole movement is here for your consideration and to be considered by you in determining whether or not due diligence has been shown by the carrier.\n\n'Now, what is due diligence? Due diligence, as that term is used in this statute means the exercise of foresight bringing to bear on the situation in hand, the transaction in hand, the human intelligence of an average man employed in such business and exercised by a man who has been experienced in railroad business, trained in railroad business so that he knows what should be done in the matter of handling railroads, operating railroads, moving cars-not merely the movement of an engine, the handling of the throttle by an engineer, not merely the handling of the conductor's work, the brakeman's work or the division superintendent's work, but the whole thing involved in the transaction of operation of the railroad in so far as the movement of this train is concerned, and whatever ingenuity, that is to say whatever human intelligence could devise and put in operation, having in mind the practical operation of a railroad, and having in mind the purpose which the law has, to get stock to market within the time mentioned, having in mind the movement of trains, the keeping of a railroad open, what human ingenuity could devise, in so far as human intelligence goes, having the benefit of experience, in the way of safeguards and in the way of provision to get stock from origin to destination within the period of this statutory limit, the railroad company has to do. Of course it is not the law that a railway company may lay out a slow schedule over a long distance and then if just before they get in to desti- \n\n[246 U.S. 512, 517]\n\u00a0\n nation something happens for which they were not prepared or equipped, merely because if that thing had not happened they might have skinned in within the thirty-six limit they are excused; that is not the law.'\n\n The statute must be construed with a view to carrying its humanitarian purpose into effect and the exception in favor of the carrier given proper latitude and enforced in the light of practical railroad conditions. Nothing indicates the running schedule was unduly slow; and the jury were improperly given to understand that, conceding matters were properly handled when accidents occurred at Proviso and Brighton Park, they might nevertheless decide the railroad could have got the car to destination within thirty-six hours if due diligence had been exercised in laying out such schedule. The definition of 'due diligence' in the charge was too exacting and misleading. As applied to the facts due diligence did not require, as the court declared, that 'whatever ingenuity, that is to say whatever human intelligence could devise and put in operation, having in mind the practical operation of a railroad, and having in mind the purpose which the law has, to get stock to market within the time mentioned, having in mind the movement of trains, the keeping of a railroad open, what human ingenuity could devise, in so far as human intelligence goes, having the benefit of experience, in the way of safeguards and in the way of provision to get stock from origin to destination within the period of this statutory limit, the railroad company has to do.'\n We find nothing in the act indicating a purpose to interfere directly with the carrier's discretion in establishing schedules for trains; the design was to fix a limit beyond which animals must not be confined, whatever the schedule, except under the extraordinary circumstances stated. In general, unloading can only take place at specially prepared places or final destination. If in the exercise of ordi- \n\n[246 U.S. 512, 518]\n\u00a0\n nary care prudence and foresight the carrier reasonably expects that following the determined schedule the containing car will reach destination or some unloading place within the prescribed time it properly may be put in transit. Thereafter the duty is on the carrier to exercise the diligence and foresight which prudent men, experienced in such matters, would adopt to prevent accidents and delays and to overcome the effect of any which may happen-with an honest purpose always to secure unloading within the lawful period. If, notwithstanding all this, unloading is actually prevented by storm or accident the reasonable delay must be excused.\n In the Hours of Service Act, 34 Stat. 1415, 1416 (Comp. St. 1916,  8679), there is a previso:\n'That the provisions of this act shall not apply in any case of casualty or unavoidable accident or the act of God; nor where the delay was the result of a cause not known to the carrier or its officer or agent in charge of such employe at the time said employe left a terminal, and which could not have been foreseen. ...'\n\n Construing this, in Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n244 \nU.S. 336, 343\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 635, 637 (61 L. Ed. 1175), we said:\n'It was not the intention of the proviso, as we read it, to relieve the carrier from the exercise of diligence to comply with the general provisions of the act, but only to relieve it from accidents arising from unknown causes which necessarily entailed overtime employment and service. United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141 [10 L. Ed. 689]. It is still the duty of the carrier to do all reasonably within its power to limit the hours of service in accordance with the requirements of the law.'\n\n This general principle should also be followed in construing and applying the provision of the statute here under consideration.\n The judgment below is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, M. & ST.

The prayer is that the plaintiffs in error be required to treat the tracks of the Eastern Company as if they were a part of the terminal systems of the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies, and that they be required to publish and maintain fair and reasonable tariffs applicable to traffic moving over them.\n A hearing upon this petition resulted in findings of fact by the Commission, among others; that the Eastern Company was then operating only one mile of main track and one mile and a half of yard track and sidings in the city of Minneapolis; that the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies each owned one-half of its capital stock and were in control of its operations; and that, assuming to be \n\n[247 U.S. 490, 492]\n\u00a0\n an independent railroad company, the Eastern Company had filed tariffs with the Interstate Commerce Commission and with the Minnesota Commission, pursuant to which it was charging and collecting, in addition to the line rate from point of origin, an extra charge of $1.50 per car for inbound loaded cars and 10 cents per ton, with a minimum of $1.50 per car, for outbound loaded cars, moving over its tracks.\n As conclusions of law the Commission found that the tracks of the Eastern Company were a part of the terminal property of the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies; that it was the legal duty of these companies to deliver cars to and to receive them from industries on the tracks of the Eastern Company without charge other than that made for the line haul; and that the extra charge which the Eastern Company was making resulted in discrimination against inbound shippers of grain to industries located upon its tracks.\n Upon these findings of fact and conclusions of law the Commission entered an order, requiring that the three companies cease charging $1.50 per car for inbound shipments over either the Milwaukee or Omaha lines which are delivered over the Eastern Company's tracks to industries located upon them or to connecting carriers; that the Eastern Company cease from charging any sum for delivering carload shipments of freight moving from connecting carriers to the Milwaukee or Omaha Companies, or moving from mills and elevators located on the Eastern Company's tracks to the Milwaukee or Omaha Companies; and that the Omaha and Milwaukee companies in the future shall operate the tracks of the Eastern Company as a part of the terminal property of each of them in the city of Minneapolis. The order is made applicable only to intrastate shipments of freight.\n On appeal to a state district court the order of the Commission was affirmed and adopted as the order of the \n\n[247 U.S. 490, 493]\n\u00a0\n court, and the decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota affirming his judgment is now before us for review.\n The contention of the railway companies in this court is stated by them 'to be reduced to the single proposition': That the Supreme Court of Minnesota erred in affirming the judgment of the district court in finding, as did the Commission that 'the tracks operated by the Eastern Company are important, convenient and necessary terminal facilities of the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies, and that these companies directly control and operate the Eastern Company.' and in adjudging, 'that the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies be required to operate the Eastern Company's tracks as a part of their terminal property at Minneapolis, without making any extra charge for moving traffic over them.'\n Review by this court is prayed for on the ground that to give effect to the judgment and order of the Minnesota court will deprive each of the three railroad companies of its property without compensation and without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and earnestly insisting that the findings of fact upon which the judgment proceeds are without support in the evidence, the plaintiffs in error urge that it be determined from the entire record before us whether substantial evidence was introduced to sustain the denial of their claimed federal right. Interstate Amusement Co. v. Albert, \n239 \nU.S. 560, 566\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 168; Jones National Bank v. Yates, \n240 \nU.S. 541, 552\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 429.\n Thus, the question presented for our decision is whether the Eastern Company, in form a corporate entity, separate and distinct from the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies, is in reality an independent carrier, exercising an independent control over the railroad to which it holds the legal title and over the conduct of its business affairs, or whether it is a mere agency or instrumentality of the two corporations, which own all of its capital stock, \n\n[247 U.S. 490, 494]\n\u00a0\n through which they collect an extra charge from the public for rendering by indirection a service which as common carriers they are legally required to render without such charge under the conditions of operation which prevail at Minneapolis.\n It is obvious that this is a mixed question of fact and of law, and from the findings of fact made by the Commission and by the district court, which differ only in unimportant details, and from evidence undisputed in the record, we derive the following statement, which we think embraces all that is essential to a decision of the case:\n The Eastern Company is a Minnesota corporation, with an authorized capital stock of $1,000,000, organized in 1878 for the declared purpose of building and operating a railroad from the city of Minneapolis to the city of St. Paul, with branches connecting with all railroads now built or hereafter to be built to or into said cities, and with branches to the mills and manufacturing establishments located therein.\n The formal organization of the company was by a group of millowners, but before any right of way was acquired or construction work done the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies came into exclusive control of the corporation and a board of directors satisfactory to them was elected, with the result that the only road which the company ever built or operated (omitting small fractions) was one mile of main track and one mile and a half of yard track and sidings in the city of Minneapolis. At the time of the trial the Eastern Company served several mills and warehouses and one elevator, it had no stations or freight depots, its only rolling stock was two engines, and the average number of its employes varied from 20 to 30 men. Its tracks are used for interchange by the Milwaukee and Omaha lines, but other companies use them for this purpose to such a limited extent, that the part of the Commission's order relating to such use is \n\n[247 U.S. 490, 495]\n\u00a0\n neglected in the evidence and arguments and in the decisions of the state courts.\n Almost immediately a ter the organization of the Eastern Company, the three companies entered into a written contract, effective for over 39 years, until May 1, 1918, which is of much significance in determining the decisive fact in the case, as we have stated it.\n This contract provides:\n\n\n (1)\n That only 300 shares of the authorized 10,000 shares of capital stock of the Eastern Company shall be issued, and, of these, 75 shares each must be issued to the Omaha and Milwaukee Companies, 145 shares to a trustee for the Eastern Company, and the remaining 5 shares shall be issued as qualifying shares to directors. The 145 trust shares 'shall not be transferable, except by the written consent of all (three) of the said parties hereto, and any transfer thereof without such consent shall be void and of no effect.'\n\n\n (2)\n The Eastern Company shall execute in proper form 150 bonds of $1, 000 each and a mortgage on all property and franchises of the company to secure their payment. The Milwaukee and Omaha Companies agree each to purchase, at 80 per cent. of their par value, one-half the amount of such of these bonds as it may be necessary to issue to pay for the right of way, construction and equipment of the railroad;\n\n\n (3)\n That the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies shall have 'equal and the same rights in and to said railway ... in all respects,' that they shall pay the same charge for switching their respective cars by said railway, and that no partiality or favor shall be shown to either;\n\n\n (4)\n That the superintendent having charge of the operation of the railroad, shall be appointed 'by the consent and mutual agreement of all parties to these presents'; \n\n[247 U.S. 490, 496]\n\u00a0\n (5) That the Eastern Company shall charge all parties one dollar for switching each loaded car, but a rebate of fifty per cent. of this charge shall be made to the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies;\n\n\n (6)\n If any other company having equal facilities with the Eastern Company for reaching mills in Minneapolis shall promptly and satisfactorily do the switching for the second and third parties (the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies) then the Eastern Company with the written consent of the Omaha and Milwaukee Companies, will do switching for such railroad companies over the said railroad of the Eastern Company on the same terms that switching is done for the said second and third parties ( the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies) over such other railroad but without rebate to any company.\n It is quite true, as is argued, that some of the provisions of this contract have been departed from, and that others have been rendered unlawful and void by statutes enacted, and by decisions of courts rendered, since its date. But this does not lessen its evidential value in determining whether the interest of the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies in the Eastern Company was that of mere stockholders in an independent public service corporation or whether they intended to and did exercise the power which they possessed as stockholders to immediately and directly control the property and the conduct of the business of the Eastern Company.\n Whether because the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies distributed each other or for other cause, it is plain that this contract was designed to take away from the board of directors of the Eastern Company, the usual and lawful governing body of a corporation, the normal legal control of the company's affairs in several most important respects. It deprived the board of the power: To issue the capital stock of the company and to finance its affairs; to select a superintendent to operate the company's two \n\n[247 U.S. 490, 497]\n\u00a0\n and one-half miles of track, by requiring that such selection be made only with the consent and mutual agreement of the three companies; to make mutual agreements for the interchange of business with any other company except with the mutual consent of the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies; and it renders one-half (save five shares) of the stock which it permits to be issued, transferable only with the written consent of the Milwauke and Omaha Companies. Thus, the making of this contract was an obvious surrender by the Eastern Company of substantially all freedom of corporate action and an assumption of control over that company by the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies, which converted it largely into a mere agency or instrumentality for doing their bidding.\n That this preliminary program of control was carried forward to realization is abundantly shown by the record.\n An accumulated surplus of $95,000 was distributed by the Eastern Company in the form of stock dividends in 1906, by dividing it equally between the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies, and when the original seven per cent. loan of $150,000 was refunded into a four and one-half per cent. loan the new bonds were taken equally by the two companies. Thus the equal interest of the two owning companies and the financial dependence of the Eastern Company were maintained.\n The management and control of all the operations of the Eastern Company has always been kept in charge of a 'managing committee' of two members, one of whom for many years before the evidence was taken was the general manager of the Omaha Company and the other the general superintendent of the Milwaukee Company. The Eastern Company did not pay either of these men any salary for their services.\n The auditor of the Omaha Company has been the auditor of the Eastern Company, which paid no part of \n\n[247 U.S. 490, 498]\n\u00a0\n his salary, and the established practice has long been for the one bookkeeper of the Eastern Company to take his journal and ledger to the auditor of the Omaha Company monthly for verification.\n Seven of the nine directors of the Eastern Company at the time the evidence was taken were officers either of the Milwaukee or Omaha Company; the eighth, the attorney of the Eastern, had desk room in the Milwaukee Company's legal department, of which he had recently been a member; and the ninth director, the president, was not an employe of either of the two owning companies.\n With the facts thus summarized, it is difficult to conceive of a plan for the control of a jointly owned company and for the operation of a jointly owned track more complete than this one is and it is sheer sophistry to argue that, because it is technically a separate legal entity, the Eastern Company is an independent public carrier, free in the conduct of its business from the control of the two companies which own it and therefore free to impose separate carrying charges upon the public.\n The record further shows that the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies separately own many tracks in Minneapolis, on which large mills and elevators are located, and that they render to such industries 'substantially the same service' as is required in delivering and receiving cars to and from like industries on the Eastern Company's track for which they make no charge whatever in addition to the line-haul rate. The general manager of the Omaha Company, who was one of the two members of the 'managing committee' of the Eastern Company, testifies that the line-haul rate to Minneapolis on the Omaha line 'includes switching to any industry on its tracks' in that city regardless of the relative distance or expense of such delivery; that this rule prevails at all points on the Omaha line; that, generally \n\n[247 U.S. 490, 499]\n\u00a0\n speaking, this is the custom of all railroads, and that if the Eastern tracks were exclusively owned by the Omaha Company deliveries to and from industries located upon them would be made without any switching charge additional to the line-haul rate. The Milwaukee Company also delivers on tracks exclusively owned by it at Minneapolis, with charge additional to the line-haul rate.\n The Eastern Company, assuming the character of an independent common carrier, pursuant to tariffs filed, collects the switching charge, which is objected to, of $1.50 per car on inbound loaded cars and a charge of 10 cents per ton, with a minimum charge of $1.50 per car, on outbound loaded cars, which move over its tracks, in addition to the line-haul rate. But the practice of the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies (with negligible exceptions) is to 'absorb' this extra charge made against outbound cars, so that, as both the Commission and the court find, 'from a practical standpoint shippers on inbound grain are the only persons who have to pay the charge' of the Eastern Company.\n The Eastern Company does not issue bills of lading and does not make any collection from shippers, but charges its switching rate against the Omaha and Milwaukee Companies, and it is paid by them from the line-haul rate on outbound traffic, and from the line-haul rate plus the switching charge, which they also collect, on inbound grain. Under such a system of doing business, the controversy in the case really relates only to the charge of the Eastern Company on inbound grain, for as to all other traffic the charge by the Eastern Company is simply a bookkeeping one which does not involve any extra switching charge to the shipper. Thus, the charge of the Eastern Company, when paid by the shipper in addition to the line-haul rate, is obviously a discrimination against industries located on the Eastern Company's \n\n[247 U.S. 490, 500]\n\u00a0\n tracks when compared with those similarly situated on other industrial spur delivery tracks which are wholly owned by either company.\n This discussion of the evidence in the case renders it very clear that the purpose of the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies from the beginning was to construct and operate but one track to the group of industries to be served, instead of each building and maintaining its own track, and to construct and use that track in common so that each might have the benefit of it as fully as if it were the sole owner. To accomplish this end they resorted to the familiar device of incorporating the Eastern Company, and in order that their purpose might not be defeated in the future, by the design or business necessity of either company, the contract between them which we have discussed, was entered into to prevent the corporate organization of the Eastern Company and the control of its operations from being changed by either owning company without the consent of the other, and the evidence makes it very clear that all through its corporate life the Eastern organization has been consistently used as a mere agency of the two owning companies to accomplish their original purpose.\n Much emphasis is laid upon statements made in various decisions of this court that ownership, alone, of capital stock in one corporation by another, does not create an identity of corporate interest between the two companies, or render the stockholding company the owner of the property of the other, or create the relation of principal and agent or representative between the two. Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Missouri Pacific Railway Co., \n115 U.S. 587\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 194; Peterson v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co., \n205 \nU.S. 364, 391\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 513; United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 413\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 527; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Stickney, \n215 \nU.S. 98, 108\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 66; United States v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co., 238 \n\n[247 U.S. 490, 501]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 516, 529, 530, 35 Sup. Ct. 873. And it is argued that since the order of the Commission requires that the tracks, the title to which is in the Eastern Company, be treated as the property of the stock owning companies, the effect of it, if enforced, will be to deprive the Eastern Company of its property without compensation and to render valueless its capital stock owned by the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies.\n While the statements of the law thus relied upon are satisfactory in the connection in which they were used, they have been plainly and repeatedly held not applicable where stock ownership has been resorted to, not for the purpose of participating in the affairs of a corporation in the normal and usual manner, but for the purpose, as in this case, of controlling a subsidiary company so that it may be used as a mere agency or instrumentality of the owning company or companies. United States v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n220 \nU.S. 257, 273\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 387; United States v. D. L. & W. R. R. Co., \n238 U.S. 516\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 873. In such a case the courts will not permit themselves to be blinded or deceived by mere forms or law but, regardless of fictions, will deal with the substance of the transaction involved as if the corporate agency did not exist and as the justice of the case may require.\n Satisfied as we are by the evidence that the Eastern Company is a completely controlled agency of the two companies which own its capital stock, we agree with the Supreme Court of Minnesota that the fact that the legal title to what are obviously terminal or spur delivery tracks is in the Eastern Company should not be permitted to become the warrant for permitting a charge upon shippers greater than they would be required to pay if that title were in the owning companies. The order of the Commission, affirmed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, so far from being arbitrary, is plainly just, and clearly it does not deprive the plaintiffs in error of their \n\n[247 U.S. 490, 502]\n\u00a0\n property without compensation or without due process of law, by requiring, as it does, that for rate-making purposes the Milwaukee and Omaha Companies shall extend to shippers over their tracks the legal title to which is in the Eastern Company, equality of treatment with that which they give to shippers over their separately owned tracks, where similar service is rendered.\n The claim that an unlawful burden is imposed upon interstate commerce by requiring that the one delivery track here involved shall be treated with respect to intrastate traffic precisely as many other similarly used and situated tracks have always been treated by the owning companies is too unsound to merit consideration.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCISSNA v. STATE OF TENN.(1918)\nNo. 20\nArgued: November 10, 1916Decided: March 11, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 289, 290]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Caruthers Ewing, of Memphis, Tenn., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John P. Bullington, of Memphis, Tenn., and Frank M. Thompson, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for the State of Tennessee.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The state of Tennessee sued Cissna and others in a court of equity of that state, setting up ownership by the state of that portion of the dry lands formerly a part of the bed of the Mississippi river which lay between low-water mark on the Tennessee side and the middle of the river as it flowed prior to the change in the channel made in the year 1876 by the opening of the Centennial Cut-Off; alleging that the defendant Cissna claiming ownership, but having none, and the Muncie Pulp Company acting under him, were cutting and removing timber from a particularly described portion of those lands; and praying for an injunction against further acts of trespass and against the removal of the timber cut, and a recovery of the value of the timber. Cissna pleaded in abatement that the land described in the bill, except a small portion to \n\n[246 U.S. 289, 291]\n\u00a0\n which he disclaimed title, was in the state of Arkansas and not in the state of Tennessee, and hence that the court had no jurisdiction over the controversy. His codefendant having raised a similar issue, the cause came on to be heard before a chancellor, who sustained the pleas to the jurisdiction and ordered that the bill be dismissed. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court of Tennessee, disregarding the form of the pleadings, treated the action as brought to recover the land as well as to stay waste in cutting and removing timber; and deeming that the question of jurisdiction which depended upon the location of the boundary line between Tennessee and Arkansas and the question of the right of the former state to recover the land were practically the same question, considered them together. The facts bearing upon the location of the boundary, recited in the opinion of the court, were substantially the same as those upon which this court passed in the boundary suit of Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 U.S. 158\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 301, 62 L. Ed. --, No. 4, Original, recently decided. The state court held, contrary to the rule laid down by this court in Iowa v. Illinois, \n147 U.S. 1\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 239, and still adhered to, that the boundary line did not follow the middle of the channel of commerce, but was fixed and defined as 'a line along the middle of the main channel of the river equidistant from the visible and permanent banks confining its waters.' The court found that the change made in the channel in the year 1876 at Centennial Cut-Off was an avulsion, and declared that 'the limits of Tennessee and Arkansas, their respective rights in the abandoned channel, and those of individuals who owned lands lying and abutting upon it, all remained as they were before the formation of the new channel.' But, not carrying this into effect, it concluded that at the place where the lands sued for are situate the correct boundary between the states was midway between the banks of the river as they existed in the year 1823 as shown by the Humphreys Map, notwithstanding \n\n[246 U.S. 289, 292]\n\u00a0\n the fact that between that date and the time of the cut-off the river had gradually encroached upon the Tennessee shore, to a large extent in the aggregate; the court holding that the effect of the avulsion was to press back the line between the two states so as to restore to Tennessee what it held before the erosions upon its banks. And since it appeared that complainant had sued only for the land lying on the hither side of the middle of the channel as it was in 1876, and therefore could not recover to the middle of the channel of 1823, the court, on remanding the cause for a hearing upon the answers of defendants, ordered that the bill might be amended so as to make the proper averments to enable the state to recover under the principles laid down n its opinion. State v. Pulp Co., 119 Tenn. 47, 104 S. W. 437.\n The cause was remanded, the pleadings were amended, and the suit remained pending in the trial court, when the state of Arkansas filed its bill in this court against the state of Tennessee to settle the boundary line between these states along that part of the former bed of the Mississippi river which was left dry as a result of the avulsion of 1876, including the portion in dispute in the present case; this being the same action above mentioned as No. 4, Original. The pendency of that action was brought by Cissna to the attention of the trial court in the present case, and made the basis of an application for a stay of proceedings until the boundary line between the states should have been fixed and located by this court. This application was overruled and the cause proceeded, with the result that the chancellor made a decree against Cissna on the merits in conformity with the opinion of the Supreme Court, subject however to an accounting with respect to the amount and value of the timber cut and removed during the pendency of the suit. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court this decree was affirmed, with modifications not necessary to be mentioned, that \n\n[246 U.S. 289, 293]\n\u00a0\n court ordered that a writ of possession be issued to place the complainant state in possession of the tract of land in controversy, and retained the case for an accounting respecting the value of the timber. By way or objection to the entry of a decree pursuant to the accounting that followed, Cissna again called the attention of the court to the boundary suit pending in this court, and prayed for a stay of proceedings in the suit against him upon the ground that any determination by that court not in accordance with the determination of this court would be void. This objection was overruled, a final judgment or decree went against him for upwards of $110,000, and the case was brought here by writ of error under section 237, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156), before the amendment of September 6, 1916 (39 Stat. 726, c. 448,  2 [Comp. St. 1916,  1214]).\n It was first argued at the October term, 1916, when, for reasons stated in \n242 U.S. 195\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 108, it was restored to the docket, and thereafter was heard at the same time with the suit of Arkansas v. Tennessee.\n Our jurisdiction is invoked upon the ground that the decision of the state court of last resort was adverse to the federal rights of plaintiff in error in two respects: (1) In overruling his prayer for a stay of proceedings to await the determination of the suit pending in this court to settle the boundary line between the states; and (2) in coming to an erroneous conclusion upon the merits of the question of the proper location of that boundary. We need not pass upon the first point, since we are of the opinion that we have jurisdiction on the second ground, and that the judgment under review must be reverse.\n The record does not show that Cissna specially set up in the state courts any contention that the decision of the merits turned upon questions of federal law, except as this may appear by inference from the nature of the grounds upon which the decision was rested. But if the Supreme Court of the state treated federal questions as \n\n[246 U.S. 289, 294]\n\u00a0\n necessarily involved and decided them adversely to plaintiff in error, and could not otherwise have reached the result that it did reach, it becomes immaterial to consider how they were raised. Miedreich v. Lauenstein , \n232 \nU.S. 236, 243\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 309; North Carolina R. R. Co. v. Zachary, \n232 \nU.S. 248, 257\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 305, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 159; Mallinckrodt Works v. St. Louis, \n238 \nU.S. 41, 49\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 671.\n The opinion of that court, State v. Pulp Co., 119 Tenn. 47, 104 S. W. 437, shows that it treated the question of jurisdiction presented by the pleas in abatement and the question of the title of the state of Tennessee to the lands in co troversy as both dependent upon the location of the boundary, because the state claimed the lands as a sovereign under the same treaties and acts of Congress by which its western boundary was defined and established; and the court held that the location of this boundary depended upon the interpretation of the Treaty of 1783 between the United States and Great Britain (8 Stat. 80, 82, art. II), the act of cession from North Carolina to the United States made in 1790 (1 Stat. 106, c. 6), the Treaty of 1795 between the United States and Spain (8 Stat. 138, 140, art. IV), the Act of Congress of June 1, 1796, admitting Tennessee into the Union as a State (1 Stat. 491, c. 47), the Louisiana Purchase Treaty of 1803 (8 Stat. 200), and the Act of Congress of June 15, 1836 (5 Stat. 50, c. 100), admitting Arkansas as a State. Upon a consideration of the Treaty of 1783, which employed the expression 'middle of the said river Mississippi' to define the western boundary of the United States, and interpreting this in view of the use of the same expression in the previous Treaty of 1763 between Great Britain, France, and Spain (3 Jenkinson's Treaties, 177), and declaring that the treaty with Spain, which provided that the western boundary of the United States should be 'in the middle of the channel or bed of the river,' was not only an interpretation of the former treaties, but superseded them, and construing the phrase 'middle of the main channel,' employed in the act ad- \n\n[246 U.S. 289, 295]\n\u00a0\n mitting Arkansas, as introducing no new meaning, the court held that the expression 'middle of the river,' by true interpretation, meant not the middle of the channel of commerce, but a line midway between the visible and fixed banks of the stream, and that any general rule of international law to the contrary must yield to the intent which the court deemed to be expressed in the treaties and acts of Congress referred to.\n Since the decision adverse to plaintiff in error turned so clearly and essentially upon questions of federal law, we have jurisdiction to review the resulting judgment. And as the conclusion reached by the state court upon the question of interpretation is directly opposed to that reached by us in Arkansas v. Tennessee upon a consideration of the same pertinent treaties and acts of Congress, we need only refer to our opinion in that case for a statement of the grounds upon which we hold that the state court erred.\n Two additional errors entered into the judgment, so intimately connected with the question of interpretation as to be inseparable from it.\n The first of these was a decision to the effect that the question of boundary had been settled by the duly constituted authorities of the two states, by judicial decisions, legislation, long acquiescence, exercise of jurisdiction, and other acts amounting to an agreement or convention defining the limit between the states to be the line midway between the visible banks of the river. Obviously, whether two states of the Union, either by long acquiescence in a practical location of their common boundary, or by agreement otherwise evidenced, have definitely fixed or changed the limits of their jurisdiction as laid down by the authority of the general government in treaty or statute, is in its nature a federal question. We have stated briefly, in Arkansas v. Tennessee, the reasons why we are unable to concur with the state court in its decision upon this point. \n\n[246 U.S. 289, 296]\n\u00a0\n The remaining error arose in the determination of the consequences of the avulsion of 1876. It is a part of the law of interstate boundaries, that where a running stream forms the boundary, if the bed and channel are changed by the natural and gradual processes of erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the varying course of the stream; while if the stream suddenly leaves its old bed and forms a new one, the resulting change of channel works no change of boundary, which remains in the middle of the old channel although no water be flowing in it. Arkansas v. Tennesse , supra. A correct application of this rule to changes in the Mississippi is necessary in order that proper effect may be given to the treaties and acts of Congress by which that river was established as an interstate boundary, and hence this is a question of federal law. The state court acknowledged the rule in theory, but departed from it in fact. Starting with the Humphreys map as showing the location of the banks of the river as they were in 1823, the date to which the earliest records related, and finding from the evidence that between that date and the time of the avulsion there has been gradual erosions from the Tennessee bank at the place where the land in controversy is situate, to an extent sufficient in the aggregate to increase the width of the river from a little less than a mile to between 1 1\/4 and 1 1\/2 miles, the court held that the subsequent emergence of the bed of the river at this place, consequent upon the avulsion of 1876, had the effect of pressing back the line between the states to the middle of the old channel as it ran in 1823, so as to restore to Tennessee what it held before the erosions from its banks. This result was reached by grafting upon the acknowledged ruel as to boundary streams an exception deduced from the rule of the common law that lands once swallowed by the sea, if afterwards exposed by its recession, are restored to the former owner if they can be identified. As we have pointed out in \n\n[246 U.S. 289, 297]\n\u00a0\n Arkansas v. Tennessee, it is a misapplication of this doctrine to treat it as forming an exception to the established rule respecting the effect of erosion, accretion, and avulsion upon the course of a boundary stream.\n We conclude, therefore, that the court erred in awarding to the state of Tennessee a recovery of any land or damages for cutting and removing timber from any land lying without the limits of the state as defined in our opinion in Arkansas v. Tennessee, supra, being a line drawn along the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Mississippi river (as distinguished from a line midway between the visible and fixed banks of the stream) as it was at the time when the current ceased to flow therein as a result of the avulsion of 1876, and without regard to changes in the banks or channel that had occurred through the natural and gradual processes of erosion and accretion prior to the avulsion.\n It results that the judgment of the state court must be\n Reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER v. DENVER UNION WATER CO.(1918)\nNo. 294\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n Water Co. \n246 U.S. 178\n (1918) ]\n\n\n[246 U.S. 178, 180]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James A. Marsh, Norton Montgomery, and Edward C. Stimson, all of Denver, Colo., for city and county of Denver.\n Messrs. Clayton C. Dorsey and Gerald Hughes, both of Denver, Colo., for Denver Union Water Co.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We have here an appeal and a cross-appeal from a final decree made in a suit in equity brought by the Denver Union Water Company against the city and county of Denver and the members of its council and other public officials, for the purpose of restraining the enforcement of an ordinance passed March 3, 1914, fixing the rates for water perm tted to be charged thereafter by the company, upon the ground that they did not afford a fair and reasonable compensation, based upon the value of the property of complainant necessarily used in the service, and hence amounted to a taking of private property without due process of law within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. The city and county of Denver is a municipal corporation having broad powers of self-government, including the power on the part of five per cent. of the electors to initiate an ordinance by petition. For convenience it will be referred to as the city.\n An answer having been filed, putting the cause at issue, the District Court, by consent of parties, appointed a special master, 'with all of the powers conferred upon the master under the rules of practice for the courts of equity of the United States, and subject to the further orders of this court, ... for the purpose of taking all testimony in the suit and reporting to the court said testimony, his findings of fact and such conclusions of law as he may deem essential to the proper advisement of \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n the court.' After a full hearing he made an elaborate report, sustaining complainant's main contention. The city and the Public Utilities Commission, defendants, filed numerous exceptions to his findings and conclusions, raising questions respecting certain elements that entered into his valuation of complainant's plant. Complainant, while declaring that it did not consent to a review of the report so far as it was conclusive under the order of reference, filed exceptions, subject to such ruling as the court might make respecting its reviewability. Upon these exceptions the cause came on to be heard, whereupon the court, being of the opinion that under the terms of the order appointing the special master his findings of fact were not open for its consideration, and that no material questions of law were raised that could be considered without an examination of the facts, ordered that the exceptions of both parties be struck out, confirmed the master's report, and passed a final decree in favor of complainant in accordance with his findings. Defendants appealed to this court, presenting assignments of error based upon the overruling by the District Court of their exceptions to the master's report. Complainant filed a cross-appeal presenting assignments of error for consideration only in the event that defendants' assignments of error, or some of them, should be sustained.\n In our opinion, the District Court erred in declining to pass upon the questions raised by the exceptions. Although no opinion was filed, the ruling appears to have been based upon the theory that because the order of reference was made by consent of parties, the conclusions of the master were not open to question. Kimberly v. Arms, \n129 \nU.S. 512, 524\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 355, and Davis v. Schwartz, \n155 \nU.S. 631, 633\n, 636 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 237, are cited in support, but they are distinguishable. In the former case, the reference, made by consent of the parties, authorized the master to hear the evidence and decide all the issues between them, and it \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 182]\n\u00a0\n was because of this that the court held the findings were not merely advisory, as in the ordinary case, but were to be taken as presumptively correct, 'subject, indeed, to be reviewed under the reservation contained in the consent and order of the court, when there has been manifest error in the consideration given to the evidence, or in the application of the law, but not otherwise,' and that the findings ought to have been treated as 'so far correct and binding as not to be disturbed unless clearly in conflict with the weight of the evidence upon which they were made.' Davis v. Schwartz is to the same effect. In the present case, the consent given to the order of reference was conditioned by the terms of the order itself, which, as we have seen, limited the functions of the master to the taking of testimony and reporting it to the court together with his findings of fact and conclusions of law for the advisement of the court.\n The error of procedure, however, does not necessitate sending the case back to the District Court. The issues were fully heard before the master, all proffered evidence was admitted, the exceptions taken to his findings raise no serious questions of fact, we have before us in the record the evidence and all other materials necessary for judgment, and will simply proceed to do what the District Court ought to have done, namely, consider the report and pass upon the exceptions, and make such decree as is equitable in the premises.\n It was admitted before the master, and is not here controverted, that the company is the sole owner of the waterworks, plant, and system in question, including lands, diversion works, reservoirs, filters, conduits, distribution works, and other apparatus, and is serving the city and its inhabitants with water, that no other waterworks or system of distribution exists in the city, and that although the city has power to construct a system of its own (subject to a limit of cost that will be mentioned be- \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 183]\n\u00a0\n low), it has not commenced to do so. It was, however, contended by defendants, in the answer and upon the hearing before the master-and the contention is here renewed-that as to such of the company's water diversion rights as had been acquired by it or its predecessors by original appropriation and user (as distinguished from those acquired by purchase) the right to the water itself was not the property of the company but of the city; and this upon the theory that, under the law of appropriation as it obtains in Colorado, the right of diversion belonged to those for whose use and benefit the appropriation was made, the company being entitled to compensation only for its services as carrier in distributing the water by means of the physical system owned by it.\n The report of the special master shows, what is not disputed, that his investigation of the matters referred to him was most painstaking and thorough. In estimating the value of the company's property, he adopted the following method, with the practical consent of the parties: Lands and water rights were appraised at their present market values; estimates of the cost of reproducing the structures were made, and, from this cost, allowance for accrued depreciation was deducted so as to determine the reasonable value of the structures in their present condition; and in estimating the cost of reproduction it was assumed that the work would be done under contract after fair competitive bidding, and with reasonable costs for engineering and superintendence in addition to the contract cost. Separate consideration was given to the various tracts of land owned by the company, and the various water rights, diversion works, reservoirs, conduits, distribution pipes, personal property, and other items constituting the plant. He found the plant to be in excellent condition, supplying water abundantly in excess of the needs of the community and under a proper pressure, and found its entire value to be $13,415,899, in which \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 184]\n\u00a0\n only elements seriously questioned by the city were: (a) The disputed water diversion rights, which he held to be the property of the company and valued at $1,998,117; and (b) an item of $800,000 for 'going concern' value, allowed by the master upon the ground that the company had 'an assembled and established plant doing business and earning money,' according to the principle laid down by this court in Des Moines Gas Co. v. City of Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 165\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 811. He made no allowance for franchise value or for any permanent right to maintain the waterworks in the streets of the city; but he did value the plant as capable of use and actually in use in the public service, and found that a new plant capable of serving the public with like efficiency could not be built for $13,415,899-a finding to which no exception was taken. The master further found that the net earnings of the company under the ordinance of 1914, after making proper allowances for operating expenses, taxes, and depreciation, would be $488,820, or only 3.64 per cent. of the reasonable value of the plant; while the prevailing rate of interest for secured loans on business and residence properties in Denver was about 6 per cent., with higher rates for loans less adequately secured.\n Defendants now insist that the company is occupying the streets and performing its service merely at sufference; that its rights arose solely out of a franchise ordinance adopted in 1890 and which expired in 1910; and that the city now has the right to exclude the company from its streets, and hence the right to fix the terms upon which it shall continue to do business, and that the value to the company of the property under these circumstances is what it would bring for some other use in case the city should build its own plant-in other words, as to a large part of the property, 'junk value.' Of course, it is a necessary corollary that the company may discontinue its service at will. \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 185]\n\u00a0\n We are unable to regard the case as capable of being thus disposed of upon the basis of 'junk value' for complainant's property.\n In the first place, no such question is presented, either by the pleadings, the master's report, the exceptions, or the assignments of error. The bill averred that complainant was 'entitled to have its property devoted to the public use of supplying the city and county of Denver and its inhabitants with water remain unimpaired in value, and to receive for the water supplied and services rendered a reasonable return upon the value of the property so devoted to said uses, and a sufficient amount to protect said property against depreciation and other impairments of value.' The answer admitted complainant's ownership of the system of waterworks (except that as to certain of the water rights it was denied upon legal grounds that have been indicated), and admitted that 'complainant is entitled to have its property devoted to the public use of supplying the city and county of Denver and its inhabitants with water remain unimpaired in value, so far as its actual use in supplying the city and county of Denver and its inhabitants with water is concerned, and to receive for the services rendered in supplying such water a reasonable return upon the value of the property devoted to such use, and a sufficient amount to protect said property against depreciation and other impairments of value in connection with such use and such water service.' The answer further alleged that the rates fixed by the ordinance of 1914 'are fair, reasonable, just, and will produce for complainant a fair, reasonable, and adequate return upon the capital actually invested by complainant in its water system and carrying service.' The master's report shows that no question was made before him but that the plant should be valued as a plant in use, except as it was contended that the item of $800, 000 for going concern value ought to be eliminated on the \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 186]\n\u00a0\n ground that such an element of value, admittedly existent in a 'purchase case,' could not be considered in a 'rate case,' and on the further ground that the company's franchise had expired. This latter point was made the basis of one of the exceptions. Aside from this, the exceptions were devoted mainly to the contention, already mentioned, that the company's water rights, other than those which had been purchased, were the property not of the company but of the city. It was at no time contended that any element of value except 'going concern value' ought to be excluded because of the expiration of the franchise. Defendant's assignments of error are based upon the exceptions, and raise no other question.\n But, supposing the question were properly raised, we are convinced that by the true intent and meaning of the ordinance of 1914 new rights were conferred upon the company of such a nature that in considering the effect of the provisions limiting rates, the plant must be valued not as 'junk' but as property useful and in use in the public service.\n It is true the title and preamble of the ordinance contain indications of a purpose to treat the company as a mere tenant by sufferance of the streets, but its enacting provisions do not carry out this purpose; and the measure must be construed as a whole, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of its adoption, and with proper regard for the consequences that would result from giving to it the meaning contended for by the city.\n Under the ordinance of 1890 the company had a franchise which expired April 10, 1910, at which time the city had an option either to purchase the works at an appraised valuation, or to renew the contract for a period of twenty years. After its expiration litigation ensued as a result of which this court held, in May, 1913, that the city was under no obligation to accept either option, and that its failure to renew the contract did not amount to an elec- \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 187]\n\u00a0\n tion to purchase the plant. Denver v. New York Trust Co., \n229 \nU.S. 123, 138\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 657. Meanwhile fruitless negotiations were conducted looking to a purchase of the plant by the city, but leaving the parties far apart upon the question of valuation. The city on May 17, 1910, adopted a charter amendment whereby it cerated the Public Utilities Commission, directed that an offer of $7,000,000 be made for the property of the company, and provided that in case of its rejection steps should be taken to construct a water system owned and operated by the city at a cost not to exceed $8,000,000. The water company rejected the offer of $7,000, 000; but the city did not commence-has not yet commenced-the construction of its own water system. The company continued to supply water to the city and its inhabitants at the rates charged during the continuance of the ordinance of 1890. In August, 1913-after our decision in the case just mentioned-the city and the Public Utilities Commission appointed a commission of three to inspect, examine, and report upon complainant's water system, and after an investigation, during which complainant gave this commission every reasonable opportunity for inspection and examination of its records and data, the commission, on January 14, 1914, made a unanimous report to the effect that complainant's system was in excellent working condition, adequate for supplying the city's present needs, and worth, exclusive of going-concern value or water rights, something over $10,000,000, and declaring that it would take five years, without allowance for delays in legal proceedings, for the city to construct a new system of its own, and would cost $12,750,000. After this report, and on February 17, there was submitted to the electors and taxpaying electors of the city a contract by which the city was to purchase complainant's water system and properties at a price to be fixed by appraisers including the Public Utilities Commission who were to act for the \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 188]\n\u00a0\n city, which contract complainant agreed to accept and abide by if favorably voted on by the taxpaying electors. It was rejected. Prior to the first of February the ordinance now in question, greatly reducing the rates, was prepared at the instance of the Public Utilities Commission, circulated as an initiated bill under the appropriate provision of the city charter, received the signatures of more than five per cent. of the electors, but only 5,593 in all,1 was filed with the city clerk about a week after the election just mentioned, was introduced in the city council, published once, and passed by the council on March 3, without amendment and without hearings; that body having acted either in the belief that, since the measure was presented with the signatures of a sufficient number of the citizens, it was mandatory upon the council to pass it, or else that they had no other option except to refer it to a vote of the people, which was not done. See Speer v. People, 52 Colo. 325, 343, 122 Pac. 768. W remark upon the legislative procedure simply because of its bearing upon the interpretation of the measure, which, as we shall see, lacks certainty in its enacting clauses.\n The practical situation existing at the time of its enactment is sufficiently clear from what has been said. The answer admits the averment of the bill that complainant has been and is compelled to continue to serve the city and its inhabitants with water, because there is no other supply of water available, and a cessation of its service would result in great suffering, damage, and loss of life. The city is located in a semi- arid region, and is and for nearly a half century has been absolutely dependent upon the continued operation of complainant's system. The termination of the legal franchise in 1910 did not absolve the city from its duty to the inhabitants. At the time of the enactment of the ordinance of 1914 the company's plant had been in use for four years since the expiration \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 189]\n\u00a0\n of the former franchise; the city, while endowed with the power to construct a system of its own, but only if it could be done at a cost not exceeding $8,000,000, had not yet commenced the construction of such a system, had just been officially advised that one could not be constructed for less than $12,750,000, and nevertheless had rejected a proposition to purchase complainant's system at an appraised value.\n It is in the light of all these circumstances that the provisions of the ordinance of 1914 must be read. There is a preamble reciting that since 1910 the company had been without franchise and a mere tenant by sufferance of the streets, and that, while it had been supplying the city and its inhabitants with water, it had done so 'at rates that are excessive and that should be reduced and regulated accordingly'; and there is a declaration that the enactment is made without recognizing the company's right to occupy the streets or to continue its service, but for the purpose of regulating and reducing its charges 'during the time it shall further act as a water carrier and tenant by sufferance of said streets.' But the enacting provisions, in the terms employed and by necessary intendment, are inconsistent with these declarations, and must be taken to override them. The first section establishes, as the maximum charges permitted to be made by the company, a detailed schedule of 'semiannual water rates payable in advance on the first day of May and November of each year.' The various uses are specified, and many of these are of kinds that cannot be discontinued on brief notice. There is a special rate for irrigation by the season, May 1 to November 1. There is a provision for meter rates, payable monthly, with a clause requiring the company to instal a meter for any person desirous of using water by meter. Section 2 provides that for hydrants, including 'those which may thereafter be ordered by the council to be set upon existing mains or upon ex- \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 190]\n\u00a0\n tensions thereof,' the city shall pay annual rentals. And section 4 imposes fines upon the company and its agents for any violation of the ordinance.\n Of course, these provisions are of themselves inexplicit; but in attributing a meaning to them the choice is between a liberal construction that preserves the substantial rights of both parties and a strict construction highly penal and destructive in its effect upon both. The subject-matter was a prime necessity of life, for which there was no substitute available. The very act of regulating the company's rates was a recognition that its plant must continue, as before, to serve the public needs. The fact that no term was specified is, under the existing circumstances, as significant of an intent that the service should continue while the need existed as of an intent that it should not be perpetual. Without attributing to the initiators and to the city council a purpose to subject the inhabitants to grave danger of disease or worse, e cannot read the enacting provisions as leaving the company actually without the right to maintain its plant in the city thereafter, for necessarily this would leave it at liberty to discontinue the service at will. The alternative, which we adopt, is to construe the ordinance as the grant of a new franchise of indefinite duration, terminable either by the city or by the company at such time and under such circumstances as may be consistent with the duty that both owe to the inhabitants of Denver. It recognizes the dependence of the city upon this plant, by necessary implication confers upon the company whatever privileges may be necessary to enable it to continue serving the public, in effect requires it to furnish water, and in terms prohibits it from exceeding the specified rates.\n In this situation, there can be no question of the company's right to adequate compensation for the use of its property employed, and necessarily employed, in the pub- \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 191]\n\u00a0\n lic service; nor can it be doubted that the property must be valued as property in use. It involves a practical contradiction of terms to say that property useful and actually used in a public service is not to be estimated as having the value of property in use, but is to be reckoned with on the basis of its 'junk value.' Nor is the question of value for present purposes greatly affected, if at all, by the fact that there is neither right nor obligation to continue the use perpetually, or for any long period that may be defined in advance. The reason is not obscure: the cost and detriment to a property owner attributable to the use of his property by the public, and the value of the service rendered by the property to the public, are measured day by day, month by month, year by year, and are little influenced by the question how long the service is to continue. The cost of the service includes the use of the plant, but, ordinarily, not its destruction, except through the slow processes of wear and tear and obsolescence, for which graduated depreciation allowances are made. The whole calculation is a matter of income, not capital, accounting; and the cost and value of the use of a given property for a stated period is the same whether the use is to be continued after the expiration of the period or not. If the period is extended, compensation for the use is extended proportionately.\n What we have said establishes the propriety of estimating complainant's property on the basis of present market values as to land, and reproduction cost, less depreciation, as to structures. That this method was fairly applied by the special master hardly is disputed by appellants, except as they contest the items allowed for 'going-concern value' and for the water rights acquired by complainant and its predecessors by original appropriation. With respect to the former item, we adhere to what was said in Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 U.S. 153\n, \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 192]\n\u00a0\n 165, 35 Sup. Ct. 811, 815 (59 L. Ed. 1244):\n'That there is an element of value in an assembled and established plant, doing business and earning money, over one not thus advanced, is self-evident. This element of value is a property right, and should be considered in determining the value of the property, upon which the owner has a right to make a fair return when the same is privately owned although dedicated to public use.'\n\n As was then observed, each case must be controlled by its own circumstances. In the present case, the master expressly declared that his detailed valuation of the physical property and water rights included no increment because the property constituted an assembled and established plant, doing business and earning money; and a careful examination of his very elaborate report convinces us that this is true. The amount allowed by him on this account is not open to serious question from the standpoint of appellants.\n The only remaining question of serious moment is the allowance of $1, 998,117 for the value of water rights acquired by original appr priation as distinguished from acquisitions by purchase.\n The master found that these appropriations were made at times when the company or its predecessor held franchise contracts with the city calling for a supply of water to the inhabitants; that these contracts were limited to short periods, while the use by private consumers was under simple permits or licenses for periods of six months, at rates paid in advance, and under expressed conditions that terminated their right to use the water on violation of the reasonable rules of the company. The parties agree that such a diversion and beneficial use of the unappropriated water of a natural stream is sufficient to initiate and perfect a right to continue to use beneficially the volume of water so appropriated. Complainant contends, and the master held, that the ownership of the \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 193]\n\u00a0\n appropriation under such circumstances may be fixed by contract between the one who diverts and the one who beneficially applies the water, and that under the circumstances of the case, upon a proper application of the rule adopted by the Supreme Court of Colorado in City of Denver v. Brown, 56 Colo. 216, 138 Pac. 44, the water rights in question were owned by complainant.\n Appellants contend that under the Constitution of Colorado (article 16,  5), and under the law as established by repeated decisions of the Supreme Court, the right to the use of water is not permitted to be acquired by appropriation from the natural streams for purposes of sale or rental; that there is no ownership of the water or right to the use of it except by those actually applying it to a beneficial use; that not only must application to a beneficial use be united to diversion in order to render the right of appropriation complete, but that where a carrying company diverts water for the beneficial use of others it acts as the agent or quasi trustee of the consumers for the protection of their rights, and is not itself the owner of the rights of diversion.\n In support of this view, Wheeler v. Northern Colorado Irrigation Co., 10 Colo. 582, 17 Pac. 487, 3 Am. St. Rep. 603; Farmers' High Line Canal & Reservoir Co. v. Southworth, 13 Colo. 111, 21 Pac. 1028, 4 L. R. A. 767; Combs v. Agricultural Ditch Co., 17 Colo. 146, 28 Pac. 966, 31 Am. St. Rep. 275; Wyatt v. Irrigation Co., 18 Colo. 298, 33 Pac. 144, 36 Am. St. Rep. 280; White v. Highline Canal Co., 22 Colo. 191, 43 Pac. 1028, 31 L. R. A. 828; Ind. Ditch Co. v. Agr. Ditch Co., 22 Colo. 513, 45 Pac. 444, 55 Am. St. Rep. 149; Wright v. Platte Valley Irrigation Co., 27 Colo. 322, 61 Pac. 603, and some other cases are cited; it being insisted that they establish the rule contended for, and that their authority is not overthrown, but on the contrary recognized, by City of Denver v. Brown, 56 Colo. 216, 138 Pac. 44. The question is one of great consequence, and is not free from difficulty. It ought not to be passed upon unless the exigencies of the case require it. \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 194]\n\u00a0\n We find it unnecessary to determine it. As we have shown, the master found the value of complainant's entire plant, including these water rights, to be $13,415,899. Deducting $1,998,117, the entire value of the disputed rights, there remains a valuation of $11,417,782. No part of this is seriously disputed except the item for going concern value, upon which we laready have passed. The master found that the net earnings of the company under the ordinance of 1914 would be $488,820. No question is made about this, except some slight criticism of the depreciation charges that enter into the calculation; a criticism that we cannot sustain. The net return, therefore, is found to be only 4.2812 per cent. of the value of the plant, excluding the disputed water rights; while there is no controversy over the master's finding that the prevailing rate of interest for secured loans on business and residence properties in Denver is about 6 per cent., with higher rates for loans less adequately secured. As was declared in Willcox v. Consolidated Gas o., \n212 \nU.S. 19, 48\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 192, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1134, the question of the rate of compensation that may be regarded as sufficient depends greatly upon circumstances and locality. In that case we held (\n212 U.S. 50\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 192, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034, 48 L. R. A. [ N. S.] 1134) that complainant was entitled to 6 per cent. on the fair value of its property devoted to the public use. We have no hesitation in holding that the return yielded by the ordinance now before us is clearly inadequate, and amounts to a taking of complainant's property without due process of law, contrary to the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment in that regard, even excluding from consideration the disputed water rights.\n The decree of the District Court will be modified so as to overrule, instead of striking out, the exceptions taken by defendants to the master's report, and as so modified it will be affirmed.\n Modified and affirmed. \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 195]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES dissenting.\n This is a bill to restrain the enforcement of an ordinance of the City and County of Denver, passed on March 3, 1914, fixing the rates for water permitted to be charged thereafter to the city and its inhabitants. After the coming in of the answer the case was referred to a special master, there was an investigation of the usual kind, a report and afterwards a final decree for the Water Company, vitiated by the judge's assumption that he was bound by the master's findings of fact. But I need not dwell upon this mistake, because in my opinion the decision ought to be reversed upon a more important ground. In some instances it would be proper to send back the case for further consideration, Wilson Cypress Co. v. Del Pozo, \n236 \nU.S. 635, 657\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 446; Brown v. Fletcher, \n237 U.S. 583\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 750; Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. v. Simon, \n246 U.S. 46\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 275, 62 L. Ed. --, decided today; but that is unnecessary when there is disclosed a fundamental bar to the bill, and I may add that, if this be the fact, no omission to raise the point in technical form would induce this Court to enter a decree contrary to the manifest equities of the case. Rule 35 (33 Sup. Ct. xviii).\n The Water Company occupied the streets of Denver with its pipes under an ordinance of April 10, 1890, and it is not denied that the franchise granted by that ordinance had expired. Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., \n229 U.S. 123\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 657. I am of opinion that the ordinance complained of does not grant a new term. Perhaps an instrument could be framed that granted while it said that it did not. But this ordinance qualifies all that follows by a preamble that recites that the Water Company is 'without a franchise and a mere tenant by sufferance of the streets of the City and County of Denver' and then, 'without in any manner recognizing said Denver Union Water Company's right to occupy the streets of the City and County of Denver, or to continue its service as a water carrier, \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 196]\n\u00a0\n for the purpose of regulating and reducing the charges made by it during the time it shall further act as a water carrier and tenant by sufferance of said streets,' goes on to fix the rates. It seems to me plain that the rates subsequently established even though purporting to be monthly or semi-annual are established subject to the preliminary declaration, and to the chance of the practically improbable earlier termination of the license or tenancy at sufferance. The ordinance does not attempt to require the Company to furnish water but simply fixes a limit to its charges while it does furnish it as such tenant at sufferance. While the service continues it is charged with a public interest and is subject to regulation by law. The question at the bottom of the case is what elements, if any, the Company has a constitutional right to have taken into account in determining whether the rates ordained are confiscatory, and, more generally, whether it has any constitutional right at all in the matter of rates.\n We must assume that the Water Company may be required, within a reasonable time, to remove its pipes from the streets. Detroit United Railway v. Detroit, \n229 \nU.S. 39, 46\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 697. And, to illustrate the problem, it may be asked how a company in that situation can assert a constitutional right to a return upon the value that those pipes would have if there under a permanent right of occupation, as against a city that is legally entitled to reduce them to their value as old iron by ordering them to be removed at once. In view of that right of the city, which if exercised, would make the Company's whole plant valueless as such, the question recurs whether the fixing of any rate by the city could be said to confiscate property on the ground that the return was too low.\n I understand that the Water Company has a right to stop furnishing water, corresponding to the right of the city to order out the pipes. It is hard to see how prop- \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 197]\n\u00a0\n erty could be confiscated by the establishment of almost any rate when whatever value it would have over above that dependent upon the use of the pipes would remain to the Company if it stopped using them and therefore was in the Company's hands to preserve. The ordinance of the city could mean no more than that the Company must accept the city's rates or stop- and as it could be stopped by the city out and out, the general principle is that it could be stopped unless a certain price should be paid. Lloyd v. Dollison, \n194 \nU.S. 445, 449\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 703; Ashley v. Ryan, \n153 \nU.S. 436, 443\n, 444 S., 14 Sup. Ct. 865. See Denver v. New York Trust Co., \n229 \nU.S. 123, 141\n, 142 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 657. It is true that this principle has not been applied in cases where the condition tended to bring about a state of things that there was a predominant public interest to prevent, but I see no ground for the application here of anything to be deduced from Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 190; Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 56\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 232, or Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Manufacturing Co., \n243 U.S. 502\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 416, L. R. A. 1917E, 1187\n\n\n It may be said that to argue from such abstract rights is to discuss the case in vacuo-that practically the Company cannot stop furnishing water without being ruined, or the city stop receiving it without being destroyed. And no doubt this is true-but it also is true and not quite as tautologous as it seems, that the law knows nothing but legal rights. Something more than the strong probability that an enjoyment will continue must be shown in order to make an otherwise lawful uncompensated interference with it a wrong. See Matter of City of Brooklyn, 143 N. Y. 596, 616, 38 N. E. 983, 26 L. R. A. 270; Id., \n166 U.S. 685\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 718. Or conversely if a legal title is taken it must be paid for in full notwithstanding a strong probability that the enjoyment of the property will continue long undisturbed. Howe v. Weymouth, 148 Mass. 605, 606, 607, 20 N. E. 316. So here the mutual dependence of the parties upon each \n\n[246 U.S. 178, 198]\n\u00a0\n other in fact does not affect the consequences of their independence of each other in law. The question before us is not what would be a fair compensation as between a necessary customer and a necessary seller, but simply whether the property of the company is taken without due process of law by the city's fixing rates for a service, while it continues, that the Company may discontinue at will and the city may order tomorrow to stop. I am of opinion that it is not. See Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 340\n, 341 S., 13 Sup. Ct. 622; Appleton Water Works Co. v. Railroad Commission, 154 Wis. 121, 136, 137, 142 N. W. 476, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 770, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 1160. Whatever may be the duty of the City toward its inhabitants, that cannot enlarg its obligations to the Company or of the Company to it after the franchise of the latter has expired, or change the meaning of an ordinance that to my mind is plain upon its face. I presume that if it be necessary the City or the Legislature can take the water works by eminent domain.\n The question is different from that which would arise upon a franchise having but a short time to run but still in force. It might be argued that the short life was a fact to be considered, as no doubt it would be in some connections. See Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 344\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 622; West Springfield v. West Springfield Aqueduct Co., 167 Mass. 128, 135, 44 N. E. 1063; Kennebec Water District v. Waterville, 97 Me. 185, 205, 54 Atl. 6, 60 L. R. A. 856. Or it well may be that while a limited franchise is in force the very fact that the Company has to rely upon the returns during the life of the franchise to reimburse its outlay and give it whatever profit it can make, entitles it to returns during that period unaffected by the approach of the end. There is no such question here.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The population of the city, by the census of 1910, was 213,381. \n\n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF CINCINNATI v. CINCINNATI & HAMILTON TRACTION CO.(1918)\nNo. 10\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1918\n\n\n Traction Co \n245 U.S. 446\n (1918) ]\n\n\n[245 U.S. 446, 448]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Constant Southworth, Charles A. Groom and Walter M. Schoenle, all of Cincinnati, Ohio, for appellant.\n Messrs. Lawrence Maxwell, Alfred C. Cassatt, Ellis G. Kinkead, and George H. Warrington, all of Cincinnati, Ohio, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.\n The Cincinnati & Hamilton Traction Company is owner and the Ohio Traction Company lessee and operator of an electric railway line extending from Vine street, \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 449]\n\u00a0\n Cincinnati, northward along Erkenbrecher avenue, Carthage pike, Wayne avenue, Springfield pike, etc., some five or six miles to the city limits. It was built in sections or links under grants, ordinances, permissions, contracts, etc., whose validity, effect, and continuation have given rise to conflicting contentions, based primarily upon different interpretations of statutes and laws of Ohio. April 21, 1914, the city council passed the ordinance copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[245 U.S. 446, 450]\n\u00a0\n Shortly before the ordinance was to become effective, appellee companies-both Ohio corporations-filed a bill in the United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, wherein they set out their interest in the railway, the various grants, ordinances, contracts, etc., under which it had been constructed, together with rights claimed. It then alleged:\n'Notwithstanding the contract rights of plaintiffs as hereinabove set forth, the \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 451]\n\u00a0\n defendant, the city of Cincinnati on or about the 21st day of April passed ... [the ordinance copied ante]. In and by said ordinance said city repudiated the grants aforesaid and thereby impaired and attempted to impair the obligations of the aforesaid contracts and each of them, in violation of article 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States, and the enforcement of said ordinance will deprive plaintiffs of their property without due process of law and without compensation, in \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 452]\n\u00a0\n violation of the Constitution of the United States, and particularly article 14 in amendment thereto.' 'The defendant, the city of Cincinnati, by its agents and employes, under the pretended authority of the ordinance of the city of Cincinnati aforesaid, thereaten to and will, unless restrained by order of this court, interfere with and prevent the maintenance and operation by plaintiffs of said electric street railway over the routes described in the grants aforesaid and under authority and in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, which will cause great and irreparable injury to these plaintiffs for which they have no adequate remedy at law.'\n\n It prayed:\n'That the court decree said ordinance passed April 21, 1914, to be null and void, and that the defendant, the city of Cincinnati, and its officers, agents, and employes, be enjoined by a restraining order, preliminary injunction, and final decree, from interfering or attempting to interfere in any way with the maintenance and operation, or either, by the plaintiff, or either of them, of said line of electric street railway or any part thereof, and from enforcing or attempting or taking any steps to enforce the pretended ordinance of the city of Cincinnati aforesaid, or any part thereof, and from taking any action which would alter, impair, limit, or destroy the right and title of plaintiffs under their said grants and contracts.'\n\n Answering, the city denied jurisdiction of the court; that the bill stated a cause of action; that complainant companies had any right to operate a railway on Erkenbrecher avenue or over portions of Carthage pike or over streets and roads formerly in the village of Hartwell, etc., and further:\n'The defendant denies that under the authority of said ordinance, or otherwise, it will, unless restrained by this court, interfere with or prevent the maintenance and operation by the plaintiffs, or either of them, of said electric street railway, or cause any damage \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 453]\n\u00a0\n or injury of any kind to the plaintiffs, or either of them, and defendant avers that the enforcement of said ordinance is only authorized and will only be sought by and through an order of a court of competent jurisdiction first had and obtained, and after a hearing on due and reasonable notice to all interested parties.'\n\n Having finally heard the cause upon a record presenting many difficult problems arising under local laws, the trial court sustained its jurisdiction, adjudicated in favor of the companies in respect of the grants, ordinances, and contracts relied upon, and granted an injunction as prayed. The city was appealed and the questions presented below have again been elaborately discussed before us.\n There is radical disagreement concerning interpretation and effect of the ordinance of April 21st. Counsel for appellees maintain:\n'The city does not seek to eject plaintiffs from the occupancy of any particular part of the streets in question, but undertakes by the ordinance complained of to require plaintiff, in disregard of its rights under existing contracts, some of which the ordinance assumes may be good, either to abandon its line over the route in question, or to operate it on a day-to-day license and at a reduced fare.' 'The question therefore is not whether there is one bad link, but whether there is one good link, because, if there is a good link, the ordinance impairs its obligation.'\n\n'All parts of the ordinance go into operation at once at 'the earliest period allowed by law,' which is 30 days after it is filed with the mayor. The day the ordinance takes effect it gives to passengers the right to a reduced fare and transfers; and at the same time the companies, by operating on the said streets, are deemed to have accepted all the terms of the ordinance, which apply to all the links. This operation of the ordinance, and these results, do not await any litigation or any adjudication of any kind.'- \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 454]\n\u00a0\n\n\n'While section 5 authorizes and directs the city solicitor in the event of noncompliance to take the proper legal proceedings to enforce the ordinance, they might not be taken, and the operation of the ordinance does not await the beginning or outcome of such proceedings, nor is the city precluded by section 5 from enforcing it in any other way, by tearing up the tracks or otherwise.'\n\n In the brief for appellant it is said:\n'These two provisions [sections 3 and 5] clearly indicate that the rights of the city must be and will be established only after an orderly procedure through the courts, and it was contemplated and directed that this should be through legal proceedings brought by the solicitor.' 'The fair reading of section 4 is that the operation of the cars over the portion of the line where it is adjudged appellees have no franchise shall be an acceptance of the ordinance.'\n\n During the oral argument here counsel for the city expressly affirmed that, properly construed and except as it authorized proceedings in court, the ordinance could have no effect prior to a judicial determination of the parties' rights; that until this was had no other steps could be taken, or would be attempted, to enforce the ordinance, and noncompliance therewith would in no wise injuriously affect the appellees; and, moreover, that the above-quoted paragraph from the answer was intended to express that view.\n We think the jurisdiction of the court below was properly invoked, and that it had power to adjudicate the issues presented. Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' St. Ry. Co., \n184 U.S. 368\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 410; Owensboro v. Cumberland Telephone Co., \n230 U.S. 58\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 988.\n As the cause is here upon appeal, it is subject to review upon both law and facts; we should grant the relief proper under circumstances now disclosed. Wiscart v. Dauchy, 3 Dall. 321, 327; Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, \n174 \nU.S. 1, 37\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 580; Daniell's Ch. Pl. & Pr. (5th Ed.) *1484, *1489; Elliott v. Toeppner, \n187 \nU.S. 327, 334\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 133. \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 455]\n\u00a0\n The answer failed to set out with adequate precision, if at all, what counsel now claim were the powers of the city's officers under, and its purposes in respect of, the ordinance; otherwise a different result might have been reached in the trial court. Accepting and, for all purposes of the cause, relying upon representations and admissions of counsel for the city as above detailed, we conclude that the decree below should be modified so as to exclude from it any finding concerning validity of franchises involved or rights claimed by appellees and to limit the affirmative relief granted to an injunction restraining the city (1) from taking any steps to enforce the ordinance (except institution of necessary court proceedings) prior to final adjudication of controversies involved, and (2) from ever setting up a claim that appellees' sontinued operation of cars over streets now used pending such final adjudication does or will amount to an acceptance of the ordinance by appellees, or in any way prejudice their rights.\n As modified, the decree below is affirmed. Appellant will pay all costs.\n Modified and affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n The opinion and and decree announced in this case seem to me so unsupported by the record and so unusual in character that I am impelled, reluctantly, to state my reasons for dissenting from both.\n The court finds that the District Court had and that this court now has jurisdiction in the case such as to warrant permanently enjoining the city of Cincinnati in the two respects stated in the opinion, and with instructions to limit its decree to such an injunction the case is remanded to the District Court, leaving open for further litigation the validity and effect of the ordinance of April 21, 1914 (copied in the margin of the court's opinion) and of prior grants claimed by the plaintiffs. \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 456]\n\u00a0\n Assuming, as we must, that if the District Court had jurisdiction of the cause, it had authority to go forward and completely dispose of the controversy, this action taken by the majority of the court seems to me to be anomalous if not unprecedented.\n But my dissent goes also upon the more fundamental ground that the District Court did not have, and that this court does not now have, any jurisdiction over the case, for reasons which I stall state as briefly as I may.\n The bill alleges that the plaintiffs and the defendant are all Ohio corporations, and after setting out in detail the grants which had been made to the plaintiffs over the various routes described in the ordinance of April 21, 1914, it continues in paragraphs 13 and 14, as follows:\n (13) Notwithstanding the contract rights of plaintiffs as hereinabove set forth, the defendant, the city of Cincinnati, on or about the 21st day of April, 1914, passed a certain alleged ordinance entitled, 'An Ordinance No. -- specifying the terms and conditions upon which the Cincinnati and Hamilton Traction Company and the Ohio Traction Company, as its lessee, may operate street cars on certain streets of the city, and authorizing the city solicitor to take legal proceedings to enforce this ordinance,' a copy of which is hereto attached, marked Exhibit A, and made a part hereof. In and by said ordinance said city repudiated the grants aforesaid, and thereby impaired and attempted to impair the obligations of the aforesaid contracts and each of them, in violation of article 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States, and the enforcement of said ordinance will deprive plaintiffs of their property without due process of law and without compensation, in violation of the Constitution of the United States and particularly article 14 in amendment thereof.'\n'(14) The defendant, the city of Cincinnati, by its \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 457]\n\u00a0\n agents and employes, under the pretended authority of the ordinance of the city of Cincinnati aforesaid, threatens to and will, unless restrained by the order of this court, interfere with and prevent the maintenance and operation by plaintiffs of said electric street railway over the routes described in the grants aforesaid and under authority and in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, which will cause great and irreparable injury to these plaintiffs for which they have no adequate remedy at law.'\n\n Since there is no diversity of citizenship, there must be found in these two paragraphs, if anywhere in the bill, the assertion of federal right sufficient to give jurisdiction to the district court.\n Confining our attention to paragraph 13. It seems to me very clear that this paragraph simply alleges that the city passed the ordinance copied in the margin of the court's opinion, and thereby 'authorized the city solicitor to take legal proceedings to enforce it.' This allegation is emphasized by making the ordinance, by reference, a part of the bill, which in section 5 specifically provides that, if the plaintiffs shall fail or refuse to comply with the terms of the ordinance, 'the city solicitor be and he hereby is authorized and directed to take such legal proceedings as may be proper and necessary to enforce the provisions of this ordinance.' or to require the company to remove their tracks from the streets. The making of this declaration by ordinance, it is averred, impaired the obligation of the grants, the contract rights, which the plaintiffs claim they had when the ordinance was passed. No action other than the passing of the ordinance had been taken by the city when the bill for injunction was filed; in fact, the ordinance did not become effective for 30 days after the bill was filed.\n It has been decided by this court, within recent years, at least twice, that for a municipal corporation to thus \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 458]\n\u00a0\n assert by resolution or by ordinance that a claim of contract right against it is not valid and to direct its legal representative to test in the courts the right so asserted neither impairs the obligation of the contract assailed nor deprives the persons claiming under it of their property without due process of law.\n In Des Moines .v Des Moines City Railway Co., \n214 U.S. 179\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 553. it was asserted as a ground of federal jurisdiction that a resolution of the Des Moines city council was a law which impaired the obligation of the contract which the railway company claimed to have with the city, and that, if given effect, it would deprive the company of its property without due process of law. The Circuit Court overruled an objection to its jurisdiction and granted an injunction against the enforcement of the resolution. This resolution, in terms, ordered the railway companies to remove their tracks, poles, and wires from the streets, and in case of failure to do so within a time stated, the city solicitor was 'instructed to take such action as he shall deem advisable and necessary to secure the enforcement of the resolution.' In a unanimous decision, this court reverses the lower court, saying:\n'We are of opinion that this is not a law impairing the rights alleged by the appellee, and therefore that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court cannot be maintained. Leaving on one side all questions as to what can be done by resolution as distinguished from ordinance under Iowa laws, we read this resolution as simply a denial of the appellee's claim and a direction to the city solicitor to resort to the courts if the appellee shall not accept the city's views. The resolution begins with a recital that questions as to the railway company's rights have been raised, and ends with a direction to the city solicitor to take to enforce the city's position. The only action to be expected from a city solicitor is a suit in court. We cannot take it to have been within the meaning of the \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 459]\n\u00a0\n direction to him that he should take a posse and begin to pull up the tracks. The order addressed to the companies to remove their tracks was simply to put them in the position of disobedience, as ground for a suit, if the city was right.'\n\n Since the court 'lays on one side' the distinction between a resolution and an ordinance, this decision seems clearly to rule the case at bar.\n Again, in Defiance Water Co. v. Defiance, \n191 U.S. 184\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 63, a claim to federal jurisdiction was based on a resolution of an Ohio city council which it was claimed impaired the obligation of a contract which the water company had with the city. But this court, while finding that the record disclosed the city as claiming that the water company did not have a valid contract with the city and that a suit to test its validity had been instituted in a state court by the city solicitor, nevertheless held that the action so taken was not obnoxious to the prohibition of the federal Constitution, and the case was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n The ordinance involved in this case, like the one in the Des Moines Case, having regard to all of its provisions, even including its title, seems very clearly to be no more than an assertion on the part of the city council of what it considers the rights of the city to be with authority and direction to the city solicitor to resort to the courts to test the validity of the claims made if they are denied by the traction companies, and the cases cited are authority sufficient, if indeed authority be needed, to justify the conclusion that such an expression of purpose to resort to the courts of the country and to abide by their decision is not a law impairing the obligation of a contract, within the meaning of the Constitution.\n A careful reading of this ordinance, especially of sections 3 and 5, makes it convincingly clear that the writer of it must have had in mind the decisions which we have cited, \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 460]\n\u00a0\n and that he has attempted, successfully it seems to me, to keep clearly within the law established by them.\n The allegation in paragraph 14 of the bill that the city and its agents and employes threaten to interfere with and prevent the operation of the street railways states no invasion of a federal right, unless such action is threatened under warrant of an invalid ordinance. If the ordinance is valid, it can add nothing to the other allegations of the bill, and, if invalid, it is futile.\n It is impossible for me, also, to share in the interpretation given to section 4 of the ordinance, which makes it the subject of special injunctive relief. The section provides that the continuing to operate cars on the streets in controversy 'shall be deemed an acceptance of this ordinance and of all of the terms thereof.' Considering the ordinance as a whole, and not as if it were a group of independent provisions, if this section has any meaning at all, it cannot be more than an assertion on the part of the city, that if the companies, without formal acceptance, but without protest, should continue to operate the lines of railway, such action would be taken as implying an acceptance of the burdens as well as of the benefits of the ordinance. But such an implication of acceptance certainly could not prevail in any court against an assertion to the contrary by the companies.\n If the companies really have contract rights in the streets, as they claim that they have, such rights cannot be impaired by the exercise of them, and if they do not have such rights, this declaration of the section cannot harm them, and therefore it cannot properly serve as a basis, either for jurisdiction or for an injunction.\n Thus considering the question of jurisdiction as depending wholly upon the form of the allegations of the bill, it seems very clear that the federal courts are without jurisdiction in the case.\n If, now, we consider the answer in the case, we shall \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 461]\n\u00a0\n find the strongest possible confirmation of the conclusion just arrived at.\n The first paragraph of the answer denies the jurisdiction of the court and asserts that it is apparent on the face of the bill that it seeks to prevent the city of Cincinnati from resorting to the state courts for a decision of the controversy, and the answer to paragraph 13 of the bill, quoted above, is a special denial. Then follows this paragraph of the answer:\n'(13) The defendant denies that under authority of said ordinance, or otherwise, it will, unless restrained by this court, interfere with or prevent the maintenance and operation by the plaintiffs, or either of them, of said electric street railway, or cause any damage or injury of any kind to the plaintiffs' or either of them, and defendant avers that the enforcement of said ordinance is only authorized and will only be sought by and through an order of a court of competent jurisdiction first had and obtained, and after a hearing on due and reasonable notice to all interested parties.'\n\n It is difficult to imagine how a clearer statement than this could be framed on the part of the city, that the enforcement of the ordinance is only authorized and will only be sought by and through an order of a court of competent jurisdiction.\n When to all this we add that not one word of evidence was offered on the trial tending to sustain the allegations of paragraph 14 of the bill that the defendant threatened and intended to interfere with and unless enjoined would prevent the operation of the street railways, it becomes very clear that we have before us an utterly unsubstantial and purely paper attempt to carry into the federal courts a case which, because of its 'many difficult problems arising under local laws,' is peculiarly one for first decision in the state courts, with the right of revision in this court as provided for by law. \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 462]\n\u00a0\n It has been for many years the constant effort, repeatedly declared, of Congress and of this court, to prevent the evasion of the Constitution and laws of the United States by bringing into the federal courts controversies between citizens of the same state (Bernard's Township v. Stebbins, \n109 \nU.S. 341, 350\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 252), and it is because of my conviction that the integrity of the jurisdiction of the federal courts can best be preserved by refusing to extend it to doubtful cases that this dissent is written thus at length. My conclusion is that the plea of the defendant to the jurisdiction of the District Court should have been sustained on the face of the bill, but that, if doubt were entertained as to this, then when the plaintiffs rested without attempting to prove their allegations of intended interference by the city with the operation of the roads, it became the duty of the District Court to proceed no further, but to dismiss the case, for the reason that it did not really and substantially involve a controversy properly within the jurisdiction of the court. Judicial Code,  37 (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1098 [Comp. St. 1916,  1019]).\n There remains to be added only this: That, even if agreement were possible with the conclusion that the court has jurisdiction in the case, nevertheless I could not agree with the judgment rendered, for the reason that it seems to me very clear that the principal grant on which the plaintiffs rely, that from the county commissioners dated March 23, 1889, expired on March 23, 1914, before the ordinance complained of was passed. My reason for this conclusion is that the Supreme Court of Ohio in 1905 held the Ohio act of 1883 (80 Ohio Laws, p. 173) invalid because in violation of section 26 of article 2 of the state Constitution. Railway Co. v. Railway Co., 5 Ohio Cir. Ct. R. (N. S.) 583, affirmed 73 Ohio St. 364, 78 N. E. 1122. This is conclusive on all federal courts. If unconstitutional in 1905, the act was unconstitutional in 1889, when the grant by the commissioners was made, and therefore \n\n[245 U.S. 446, 463]\n\u00a0\n sections 3439 and 2502 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio of 1880 were then in force and imposed the limitation of 25 years on all grants by county commissioners. The doctrine that rights acquired before cannot be impaired by a change of judicial decision has no application to this case, for the reason that there was no settled principle of decision in Ohio in cases such as we have here, where counties were concerned, prior to 1889, or at any other time, but, as the decisions abundantly prove each case as it arose was disposed of on its own peculiar facts, e. g., State v. Powers, 38 Ohio St. 54 (1882), overruled in State ex rel. v. Shearer, 46 Ohio St. 275, 20 N. E. 335 (1889).\n For the reasons here given and upon the authorities cited, my conclusion is that the decree of the District Court should be reversed, and the case remanded, with instructions to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] An Ordinance No. ___.\n Specifying the terms and conditions upon which the Cincinnati & Hamilton Traction Company and the Ohio Traction Company, as its lessee, may operate street cars on certain streets of the city, and authorizing the city solicitor to take legal proceedings to enforce this ordinance.\n Whereas, the Ohio Traction Company, as lessee of the Cincinnati & Hamilton Traction Company, is new operating street cars on certain streets of the City of Cincinnati; and\n Whereas, on portions of the streets so occupied and used alleged grants have heretofore expired and on other portions, including that part of Carthage pike formerly known as Springfield pike there never have been any grants and said companies have no longer any right to occupy the same: Now, therefore,\n Be it ordained by the council of the city of Cincinnati, state of Ohio:\n Section 1.

CO.(1918)\nNo. 225\nArgued: Decided: April 15, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 413, 414]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. E. Stricklett and Frederick W. Schmitz, both of Covington, Ky., for appellant.\n Messrs. Alfred C. Cassatt, Richard P. Ernst, and Frank W. Cottle, all of Cincinnati, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by the appellee to restrain the City of Covington from carrying out an ordi- \n\n[246 U.S. 413, 415]\n\u00a0\n nance of July 14, 1913, that provides for the grant of a twenty-year franchise for a street railway over certain streets to the best bidder. The plaintiff claims a right by grant and contract over the same streets, which will be interfered with, and sets up article 1,  10, and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. The defendant says that the plaintiff's grant has expired, and that if it purports to be perpetual it was beyond the power of the city. These are the two propositions argued. The District Court granted the injunction as prayed and the city appealed.\n We will consider first the scope of the ordinances and contract under which the plaintiff makes its claim. On January 21, 1870, Edward F. Abbott, S. J. Redgate and their associates were incorporated, with perpetual succession, as the Covington and Cincinnati Street Railway Company, with power to construct railways in the City of Covington along such streets as the council might grant the right of way to, and along such roads out of the city as the companies owning the roads might cede the right to use. The company was authorized to purchase and hold such routes and railway tracks as might be deemed necessary for its use, and to connect with and use the tracks of other railways in the vicinity upon equitable terms. Just before their incorporation, on December 13, 1869, an ordinance was passed by the city granting, according to the terms of a contract executed on December 23, 1869, to Abbott and Redgate, 'their associates, successors and assigns,' 'all the right and authority that [the city had] the capacity to grant, to construct, hold and operate a street railroad upon and along' the streets named. The only provision for a termination of the rights conveyed was in case of a failure of the grantees to keep their covenants. On December 28, 1874, an ordinance was passed extending the time for completing the work under the Abbott contract, \n\n[246 U.S. 413, 416]\n\u00a0\n renewing the terms of the same but somewhat changing the route, and on January 28, 1875, another authorized an extension to a suspension bridge across the Ohio. On May 1, 1875, Abbott and his associates conveyed all their rights under the foregoing ordinances and contract to the corporation that they had formed, and the title of the corporation was recognized by an ordinance of June 21, 1875. On January 25, 1876, Abbott and others were incorporated with perpetual succession as the South Covington and Cincinnati Street Railway Company, the appellee, with substantially the same powers that were granted to the Covington and Cincinnati Company, and on December 20, 1876, the last-named corporation conveyed its rights to the appellee. The latter has whatever rights were acquired by Abbott, as was recognized by an ordinance of October 13, 1881\n\n\n As there is no hint at any limitation of time in the grant to Abbott, and on the other hand the city grants all the right and authority that it has the capacity to grant, there can be no question that the words taken by themselves purport a grant in perpetuity more strongly than those held to have that effect in Owensboro v. Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co., \n230 U.S. 58\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 988. The fact chiefly relied upon to narrow their operation is found in the terms of 'an ordinance prescribing the terms and conditions of street passenger railroads within the City of Covington' passed on December 15, 1864, before the dealings with Abbott. By section 13 'all contracts made under the provisions of this ordinance shall be for the term and period of twenty-five years.' It is contended that this by implication governs later transactions. But there is little ground for even an argument upon the point. The ordinance is providing for proposals and a contract with the best bidder, concerning routes contemplated by a rival of the Covington and Cincinnati, the Covington Street Railway Company incorporated on February 9, \n\n[246 U.S. 413, 417]\n\u00a0\n 1864 (afterwards bought up by the appellee). The contracts referred to in section 13 are primarily at least contracts of those who should acquire the franchises offered, such as in fact were made. In no sense is the Abbott contract a contract under that ordinance. It was a contract under the ordinance of 1869, which established its substance and even its form. The ordinance of 1864 did not address itself to the construction or scope of future ordinances, but only of certain contracts of which Abbott's was not one. We regard the matter as too plain to be pursued into greater detail. This part of our decision covers all the grants to Abbott including the right to lay tracks to the suspension bridge.\n There were extensions of the plaintiff's rights by acts of the Legislature of March 13, and April 5, 1878 (Laws 1877-78, cc. 423, 813), in general terms that there seems to be no reason for supposing more limited in time than the original grant. See section 3. The only part of this branch of the case needing further discussion concerns the rights acquired by the plaintiff through the purchase of its rival's, the Covington Street Railway's, lines. This company, under the ordinance of 1864 that we have mentioned got a franchise limited to twenty-five years, but with provisions that there should be a new bid after that time and that the successful bidder, if other than the Covington Street Railway Company, should purchase its property upon a valuation. It did not lose the value of that property by the ending of its right of use. On June 8, 1882, the plaintiff, already having a general authority by its charter, was authorized by 'an ordinance granting the right of way over certain streets ... to' the plaintiff, to contract with the Covington Street Railway Company for the right of way held by the latter and to occupy and use the streets specified in the contract of that road with the city 'subject to the conditions, limitations and restrictions contained in the ordinances regulating its (the plaintiff's) right to \n\n[246 U.S. 413, 418]\n\u00a0\n the streets now occupied by said South Covington and Cincinnati Street Railway Company.' This grant was on condition that the plaintiff should remove the tracks by which it connected with the suspension bridge under the ordinance of January 28, 1875, and give up its rights to the same, which as we have said were r ghts in fee. It got other access to the bridge over the Covington Street Railway line, but we agree with the district judge that it is not to be supposed that it would give up its perpetual right for a franchise having eight years to run over a less convenient route, so far as this part of its purchase was concerned. We agree also that the language of the ordinance conveys more than a license to purchase what the vendor had. The title and the operative words import a grant and the reference to the ordinances regulating the plaintiff's right in the streets adopts as the measure these, not the contract with the selling road. The ordinance was followed by the contemplated contract in July, 1882. Some further grants need no special mention. We are of opinion that the plaintiff's right in this part of its system also is a right in fee.\n The question of the power of the city to grant a perpetual franchise needs but few words. By statute the streets were 'vested in the city' and the authorities of the city were given 'exclusive control over the same' and in another section the council was given 'exclusive power to establish and regulate ... all sidewalks, streets, alleys, lanes, spaces and commons of the city.' Acts 1849-50, c. 237, art. 1,  2, p. 239, and article 2,  19, p. 247. No decision of the State Court is brought to our attention that calls for any hesitation in following the authority of Owensboro v. Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co., \n230 U.S. 58\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 988, and pronouncing the authority complete. Wolfe v. Covington & Lexington R. R., 15 B. Mon. (Ky.) 404. A street railroad is one of the ordinary incidents of a city \n\n[246 U.S. 413, 419]\n\u00a0\n street and stands on a different footing from the steam roads habitually run over separate rights of way. See, also, Act of March 13, 1878, c. 423, and Act of April 5, 1878, c. 813,  1, 3.\n Decree affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissenting.\n I have so recently stated my reasons for not concurring in opinions which seemed to me, by inference and construction, to raise limited, into perpetual, grants of rights in city streets, that I shall not repeat them here (City of Owensboro, Kentucky, v. Owensboro Water Works Co., \n243 \nU.S. 166, 174\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 322; Northern Ohio Traction & Light Co. et al. v. State of Ohio, decided January 28, 1918, \n245 U.S. 574\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 196, 62 L. Ed. --), but shall confine myself to a brief statement of the facts and conclusions of law which lead me to dissent from the court's opinion in this case.\n The opinion of the court begins with the grant to Abbott et al., in December, 1869, but in my judgment that grant cannot be correctly interpreted without beginning five years earlier, in 1864, with an ordinance passed by the city, which is general in its terms and is described in the record of council as 'an ordinance defining the obligations of any company or individual to whom privilege may be granted to use the streets of the city for street railroad purposes.' It is entitled, 'An ordinance prescribing the terms and conditions on street passenger railroads within the City of Covington.' This ordinance contained these provisions:\n'This ordinance shall continue and be in force from and after its passage. All contracts under the provisions of this ordinance shall be for the term and period of twenty-five years.'\n\n And so far as the record shows it has never been repealed.\n Pursuant to the terms of this general ordinance, a contract was entered into as of March 9, 1865, with the Covington Street Railway Company, giving it the right to \n\n[246 U.S. 413, 420]\n\u00a0\n operate a street railway on designated streets, again 'for the period of twenty-five years from its date.'\n More than four years later, on May 13, 1869, Abbott and others made an application to the council for a franchise and the company holding the prior grant, which was then operating a railway, protested against the making of a grant to Abbott, and warned the city that it claimed the right to operate on all its streets and that another grant could not lawfully be made.\n But at the meeting at which this protest was filed, without any special authority from the Legislature, this grant was made to Abbott. It is from the language of this grant that the court derives a perpetual franchise, and it reads:\n'Be it ordained by the city council of Covington that all the authority and right that the city of Covington has the capacity to be, and the same is hereby granted to E. F. Abbott et al. ... to construct, hold and operate a street railroad,' upon designated streets.\n\n I cannot bring myself to think that this is the language men would use who were intending to grant perpetual rights in city streets, but rather it seems to be the cautious describing of what the councilmen thought a doubtful right under a doubtful remnant of authority, remaining after the grant to the other company which was threatening litigation if this further grant were made, and that they thought it subject to the limitation of twenty-five years in the general ordinance of 1864. And be it noted that this grant, made without special authority from the Legislature, is dated December 13, 1869; that the Covington & Cincinnati Street Railway Company, the predecessor of the defendant in error, was not chartered for more than a year after the date of this grant to Abbott, from which all the rights of the defendant in error are claimed to flow; and that it did not acquire the grant \n\n[246 U.S. 413, 421]\n\u00a0\n until 1875 in which year the first construction work was done under it.\n Some twenty years after the grant to Abbott the city of Covington granted, this time to the Cincinnati Covington & Rosedale Company, a franchise which was expressly limited to fifty years and which, recognizing that the general ordinance of December 15, 1864, was still effective, required that the grantee should conform to all the requirements of that ordinance 'except in so far as the same has been repealed.'\n In the street railroad case of Louisville City Ry. Co. v. City of Louisville, 8 Bush (Ky.) 415, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, construing the charter of the city of Louisville, granting jurisdiction over streets, in scope, not less than that granted by the Covington charter, declared:\n'Under the general power of a municipal government to control and regulate the use of the streets of a city, it cannot grant to any person or corporation the right to lay down a railway in a street . ... The right of the general council to contract with a railway company grows out of the special acts of the Legislature heretofore quoted.'\n\n Whether this statement was necessary to the decision of the case then under consideration or not, in the following year it was paraphrased and adopted in a Covington Street Ry. Co. Case, 9 Bush (Ky.) 127, and, almost twenty years after that it was again approved in a Covington Case, 90 Ky. 390, 14 S. W. 361.\n Thus, during the entire period covered by the grants here involved, it was the law of the state, as its highest court understood and announced it, that the city of Covington did not have, under its charter, power to make a street railway grant, 'without special authority so to do from the Legislature.'\n That this was also the opinion of the Legislature of the \n\n[246 U.S. 413, 422]\n\u00a0\n state and of that part of the bar of the state concerned with the grants here involved is conclusively shown by the fact that in the charter of every one of the three street railway companies concerned herein there is a special grant of power to the city of Covington to make the contemplated contract for the use of its streets for street railway purposes.\n This obscurely worded grant, thus made to Abbott without special legislative authority, is not helped out by subsequent recognition by the city, for we find the parties, almost from the beginning of its term, dealing with each other constantly at arm's length, the city claiming that the grant was, at most, limited to twenty-five years, and the railway company claiming it to be perpetual.\n For instan e, as early as 1887, when the right to use electric power was granted, a typical provision was inserted in the ordinance, accepted in writing by the company:\n'That nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to nor shall it give to said railway any further or longer time than it now has to operate its lines.'\n\n Again, in 1892, for a reduction of fare and other considerations the city agrees 'for the period of twenty years after the acceptance of this ordinance' not to offer for sale any of the rights or franchises of the defendant in error in the said streets; and it was not until after the expiration of this period that the proposition to grant a new franchise was made, which the decision of the court permanently enjoins.\n This is sufficient of detail to indicate why I am of opinion that the meager and equivocal grant of 1869 should not be regarded as helped out by the subsequent dealings of the assignees of it with the city.\n Under the circumstances thus presented, with limited franchises granted before and after this grant to individuals, but never one unlimited in terms with the city contending always that this franchise was for twenty-five \n\n[246 U.S. 413, 423]\n\u00a0\n years only, and with the courts, Legislature, and bar of the state united in thinking that there was no power in the municipality to make even a limited street railroad grant without special legislative warrant, I cannot bring myself to consent to construe, as the court does, an obscurely worded clause of a single sentence, found in a grant to individuals, of the right to construct an insignificant horse railroad, which the son of the grantee in an affidavit alleges required an expenditure of only $48,000, so as to impose upon the municipality 'the unspeakable burden' of a perpetual franchise to operate street railroads in its streets.\n Fully realizing the futility, for the present, of dissenting from what seems to me to be an unfortunate extension of the doctrine of the Owensboro Case, \n230 U.S. 58\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 988, I deem it my duty to record my dissent, with the hope for a return to the sound, but now seemingly neglected, doctrine of Blair v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 400, 463\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 427, declaring that a corporation which would successfully assert a private right in a public street must come prepared to show that it has been conferred 'in plain terms,' 'in express terms,' and that any ambiguity in the terms of the grant must be resolved in favor of the public and against the corporation 'which can claim nothing which is not clearly given.' The reason given by the court for this rule is that 'grants of this character are usually prepared by those interested in them,' and that 'it serves to defeat any purpose, concealed by the skillful use of terms, to accomplish something not apparent on the face of the act.' This is declared to be 'sound doctrine which should be vigilantly observed and enforced.'\n Believing that the application of this wise rule to the decree before us must result in its reversal, I dissent from the opinion of the court.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF MITCHELL v. DAKOTA CENTRAL TEL CO.(1918)\nNo. 198\nArgued: Decided: April 15, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 396, 397]\n\u00a0\n The Dakota Central Telephone Company, herein called the telephone company, brought suit against the city of Mitchell, herein called the city, to enjoin it from enforcing or attempting to enforce a resolution or ordinance of the city passed March 17, 1913, terminating the right of the telephone company to maintain and operate the company's system of telephones, and requiring the removal of its poles, etc., from the streets, and to declare the resolution or ordinance unconstitutional and void.\n The bill alleges the following facts, which are the basis of the contentions of appellant. We state them narratively:\n The telephone company is a South Dakota corporation, and under section 554 of the Civil Code of the state has been given the power to operate telegraph and telephone lines within the towns and cities of the state and to use the public grounds, streets, alleys and highways subject to control of the proper municipal authorities as to which of them the lines shall run over and across, and the places where the poles to support the wires shall be located.\n Since its incorporation the company has acquired by purchase and construction certain lines of telephone and certain telephone exchanges and has been engaged as a common carrier in transmitting telephone messages, is so engaged in about 85 cities, and has about 265 telephone \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 398]\n\u00a0\n stations, other than exchanges, situated in South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota, and has also, outside of the lines situated in cities and towns, about 85 exchanges, about 265 stations and about 5,000 miles of telephone lines.\n May 11, 1898, the city granted by ordinance to F. E. Elce and his associates, heirs and assigns, a right to use the streets and alleys of the city for the maintenance of a public telephone system. The right granted was not exclusive.\n Elce duly accepted the terms and conditions of the ordinance and installed a local telephone system and conducted and operated it until on or about July 8, 1904\n\n\n The Dakota Central Telephone Lines, a South Dakota corporation, was given by ordinance dated March 21, 1904, and numbered 174, authority to use the streets of the city for the purpose of operating long distance telephone lines within and through the city 'for supplying the citizens of Mitchell, and the public in general, facilities to communicate by lond distance or other electrical devices with parties residing near or at a distance from Mitchell.' In consideration of the ordinance the city was given the right to string wires on the poles of the company for fire alarm purposes.\n The ordinance proved insufficient for its purpose and on June 6, 1904, a new ordinance was passed. The latter ordinance amended section 1 of the other so as to enable communication 'with parties residing in, near or at a distance from Mitchell.' The word in italics was the amendment. And the word 'lines' in ordinance No. 174 was changed to the word 'system' in ordinance No. 180.\n At the time the last ordinances (Nos. 174 and 180) were assed the telephone instruments then in general use could not be used successfully for long distance conversations, but there had been developed instruments for such conversations. Such telephones were then known \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 399]\n\u00a0\n as 'long distance telephones' and were only supplied to subscribers at telephone exchanges by special arrangement with the individual subscribers, who desired an instrument efficient for both local and long distance conversations. At said time, however, the art had so far advanced that the public in general were demanding the installation of 'long distance telephones' in local telephone exchanges.\n Long prior to the adoption of ordinances 174 and 180 the Southern Dakota Telephone Company had constructed in the city of Mitchell and other towns and cities of the state and had secured the consent of Mitchell to the construction in that city of such lines, commonly known as 'toll lines' as distinguished from telephone exchanges. In 1903 the Dakota Central Telephone Lines purchased those toll lines and was operating them at the time of and long prior to the adoption of ordinances 174 and 180.\n That company, relying upon the consent of the city as expressed in ordinance 174, purchased from Elce the property then and now known as the Mitchell Telephone Exchange, consisting of the poles and other property as well as certain real property used in connection therewith. After entering into the contract to purchase and upon discovering the insufficiency of ordinance 174, the company applied to the city for ordinance 180, and when it was passed completed the purchase from Elce and took possession of the property and owned and operated the exchange with all other exchanges until October 2, 1904, when it sold all of its rights to complainant, Dakota Central Telephone Company, and the latter company has since continuously operated the exchange and toll lines.\n Thereafter there was such improvement in telephone instruments and appliances that it became desirable to reconstruct the telephone exchange in the city, and in order to install a telephone system known as the 'Automatic' \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 400]\n\u00a0\n it became necessary to put in permanent underground ways in which to place the wires and cables and otherwise construct and install expensive instruments, and in order to be secure in making such extensive improvements the company applied for and obtained permission by ordinance 'to place, construct and maintain through and under the streets and alleys, and public grounds of said city, all conduits, manholes and cables proper and necessary for supplying to the citizens of said city and the public in general communication by telephone and other improved appliances.' (This is referred to hereafter as the resolution of April 10, 1907.)\n Relying on the ordinance (resolution) and the other ordinances, the company began to reconstruct and extend its telephone exchange in the city, and continued such work until the plant was thoroughly prepared for the installation of the 'Automatic System.' As part of the improvements the company erected a fireproof exchange building, it and the system causing an expenditure of $100,000. The system is now in operation and has about 1, 100 subscribers, all of whom are in direct communication and can communicate with persons at all the exchanges and stations of the company's telephone system in South Dakota and Minnesota.\n The company has complied with all of the requirements of the ordinance and has acquired a vested right to maintain and operate the exchange and lines described.\n The company owns and operates lines from the city to other cities and other states than South Dakota (these are all mentioned in the bill) and the tolls for such interstate communication amount to more than $4,000 a month. It has also contracted with the United States government whereby it receives and transmits and delivers the messages of the officers of the Weather Bureau to 32 cities and towns situated on its lines in South Dakota. \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 401]\n\u00a0\n It also furnishes telephone service to other officers of the government in various towns and cities and places, and that this service may not be interfered with it seeks relief.\n The city, assuming it had the right to require the removal of the company's lines and exchange from the city and from the streets and alleys therein, and assuming that the rights of the company would expire May 11, 1913, and further assuming the right to terminate the company's rights, did, on March 17, 1913, notify and request it to remove from the city its poles, wires, cables, fixtures and apparatus of every kind and description used by it in the construction, maintenance and operation of its local telephone exchange or system in the city and that if it failed to do so, the city would take steps to secure the immediate removal of the described instruments.\n At the same meeting the city adopted two other resolutions, one called 'Telephone Resolution,' by which it declared the right of the company terminated from and after May 11, 1913, and in which it directed the officers of the city not to contract with the company for telephone service and on the said date to terminate all relations with the company; the other, called 'Fire Alarm Resolution,' which also declared the rights of the company terminated May 11, 1913, and then provided for the fire alarm service to take the place of that supplied by the company.\n The threatened removal and consequent destruction of the company's telephone system and the deprivation of rights will cause the company damage to the amount of $110,000.\n Besides the above facts the bill alleges that the ordinance or resolution of the city for the removal of the poles and lines of the company has the force and effect of a law of South Dakota within the intent and meaning \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 402]\n\u00a0\n of section 10, art. 1, of the Constitution of the United States and, so construed, is a law impairing the obligation of the contracts existing between the company and the city.\n That the value of the company's exchange and lines consists largely in installing the poles, wires, and other apparatus; that if taken down the salvage will be nominal and that therefore the removal thereof will deprive the company of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. That the wrongs done and threatened will also obstruct and interfere with the dispatch and transmission of interstate business in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the act of Congress regulating interstate commerce.\n An injunction was prayed.\n The answer of the city in most part tenders only issues of law; in other words, the effect of the ordinances of the city. The following facts, however, are averred, stated narratively: The company, for a long time after the passage of ordinances 174 and 180, made no claim that its local exchange was not maintained and operated under ordinance 135 (ordinance of Elce) or that that ordinance was in any way repealed or superseded or modified by the other ordinances or that the company was operating a local telephone system under those ordinances, but, on the contrary, the company has complied with all of the terms and conditions of ordinance 135.\n The company has frequently negotiated with the city for a renewal or extension of its franchise from and after May 11, 1913, but a renewal or extension has not been granted; and both the company and the city have construed ordinance 135 as in full force and effect and it has in no way been repealed, superseded or modified.\n The company did not inform the city or any of its officers of its desire to install an automatic telephone \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 403]\n\u00a0\n system and made the improvement with full knowledge of the city's attitude, and in the early part of the year 1913 the company attempted to force the automatic system into the city, regardless of the wishes of the municipal authorities, by securing the consent of the individual citizens thereof to the installation of such telephones, and immedia ely upon learning of such attempt the city council, March 26, 1912, passed separate resolutions defining the city's attitude.\n The company is operating two systems in the city, a local and a long distance system, the former under ordinance 135 (that granted to Elce), and the latter under ordinances 174 and 180; that the rights under ordinance 135 expired May 11, 1913, that the resolutions of which the company complains apply only to ordinance 135, that is, to the local telephone exchange, and do not and were not intended to apply to the long distance system, and the city expressly denies any purpose or intention to interfere with or molest the company in the maintenance and operation of the long distance system.\n The city pleads a judgment rendered in a suit in which it was complainant against the company, by which the rights that the latter now asserts were adjudicated against it, and prays, by reason of the premises, that the bill of the company be dismissed.\n After hearing, upon a stipulation of certain facts and oral testimony, a decree was entered adjudging the ordinance of the city of March 17, 1913, unconstitutional and void in that it impaired the obligations of the contract contained in ordinance 180, in violation of section 10, art. 1, of the Constitution of the United States, and deprived the company of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, and enjoined the city from enforcing the ordinance.\n This appeal was then allowed. \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 404]\n\u00a0\n Messers. Louritz Miller, of Mitchell, S. D. and Edward E. Wagner, of Sioux Falls, S. D., for appellant.\n Mr. T. H. Null, of Huron, S. D., for appellee.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 396, 406]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Counsel agree that the issues on this appeal are: (1) The jurisdiction of the District Court. (2) The scope and interpretation of ordinances Nos. 174 and 180. (3) Whether the judgment pleaded by the city is res judicata.\n The first proposition needs but little comment. The company attacked the ordinance or resolution of the city requiring the company to remove its poles and wires from the streets as an impairment of the contract constituted by other ordinances and hence invoked against the city the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States and also, on account of the asserted destruction of its property, urged in its protection the due process clause. The city combated both propositions. The District Court, however, sustained both, resting its decision upon the opinion of the Supreme Court of the state in a suit by the city against the telephone company. City of Mitchell v. Dakota Central Telephone Co., 25 S. D. 409, 127 N. W. 582. We shall presently consider this case. For the disposition of the present contention it is enough to say the case was brought by the city to recover a percentage of gross receipts of the company as provided in ordinance 135. In resistance the company contended that the provision was inserted without authority and was illegal and void and contended besides that its rights in the streets were not derived from the city but from section 554 of the Civil Code of the state and that it was not competent for the city to impose conditions upon the \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 407]\n\u00a0\n company. The court rejected the contentions and held that under the Constitution of the state the city had the right to grant or withhold its consent to the use of its streets, and it necessarily had the right to grant the same upon such terms and conditions as it might to choose to impose.\n Applying the case, the District Court sustained the validity of ordinance No. 135, but decided that it expired by limitation of time in May 1913, and that necessarily the rights granted by it terminated on that date, and that the company's rights, if it had any, were derived from ordinance 180 and the resolution of April 10, 1907.1 The court considered the former a valid exercise of the p wer of the city and a contract between it and the company which was impaired by the subsequent resolutions.\n It will be seen, therefore, that the company invoked rights under the Constitution of the United States and the District Court considered them to be substantial, not formal, and accordingly exercised jurisdiction.\n The second and third propositions mingle in discussion. The District Court decided, as we have said, that ordinance 180 constituted a contract between the city and the company, and, exerting the right to interpret it, further decided that it gave the company the right to occupy the streets and compelled an injunction against the city's resolution and attempt to remove it. We shall spend no time in vindication of the exertion of the right; it is an established right of the federal courts, when the \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 408]\n\u00a0\n contract clause of the Constitution of the United States is invoked, and we pass immediately to the consideration of ordinance No. 180. As we have seen, it was preceded by some years by ordinance No. 135, and by some months by ordinance No. 174. It was passed, it is contended, to complete the latter; in what respect we shall presently consider.\n The case centers upon the ordinance. The telephone company contends that it gives the company the right to operate not merely long distance lines, but a local telephone exchange within the city. In other words, the contention is that it superseded ordinance No. 135 and became a new source of right, a right both of long distance and local exchange. The city opposes this construction and insists that it, the ordinance, confers only the right to maintain a long distance system; that the right to a local exchange was given by ordinance No. 135 and expired with the expiration of that ordinance, May, 1913. And the city urges that its characterization of ordinance No. 180 was sustained by the Supreme Court of the State in City of Mitchell v. Dakota Central Telephone Company, supra.\n Counsel are at odds as to the case. It, as we have seen, was brought by the city against the company to recover a certain percentage of the gross receipts of the company, provided to be paid by section 4 of the ordinance No. 135. One of the defenses of the company was that that ordinance was in effect repealed and superseded by ordinance No. 180 so far as it related to the payment of the percentage of the gross proceeds of the company. The Supreme Court decided against the defense, reversing the judgment of the trial court. The court, in answer to the contention of the company, held that ordinance No. 180 did not 'have the effect of repealing, qualifying, or modifying ordinance No. 135, and the fact that the defendant [the company] paid the 10 per cent. on its gross proceeds for two years subsequently to the adoption of ordinance \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 409]\n\u00a0\n No. 180 clearly shows that it did not claim, for a time, at least, that ordinance No. 180 in any manner affected the prior ordinance. ... There is clearly no inconsistency between the two ordinances; one being for a local city telephone system, and the other being for a long distance telephone system.'\n The court also decided that the resolution of the city of April 10, 1907, had not the effect of repealing ordinance No. 135, but had only the purpose of giving to the company permission to place its wires underground instead of stretching them on poles in the streets.\n The decision would seem to need no comment. It clearly adjudged that the ordinances had different purposes, and that ordinance No. 135 was not repealed in any particular by No. 180, the former applying to the local system and the latter to the long distance system.\n The District Court, however, did not give the decision this broad effect but considered that it concluded only 'that the two ordinances did not cover so exactly the same field and scope that it could be fairly said that the city intended by the passage of ordinance No. 180 to repeal ordinance No. 135.' It is not very obvious how ordinance No. 135 could exist for one purpose and not for all the purposes for which it was enacted; how it could exist for the exaction of a revenue from the system and not exist for the system; how it could coexist for nine years with No. 180 and yet have been superseded by the latter. Besides the Supreme Court distinguished between the two ordinances, declaring that there was no inconsistency between them, 'one being for a local city telephone system, and the other being for a long distance telephone system.' The decision, indeed, gave emphasis to the distinction. From the operation of one a revenue was exacted, upon the other no condition was imposed.\n It is, however, alleged in the bill that the company had \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 410]\n\u00a0\n by certain enumerated acts acquired a vested right to maintain and operate its telephone exchange and lines, and to secure its peaceable enjoyment of such rights as against the wrongful acts of the city it brought this suit. This idea is not pressed in the argument and is not sustained by the stipulated facts. The case is rested upon 'the scope and interpretation to be placed upon ordinances Nos. 174 and 180,' the contention being that they constitute a contract the obligation of which the resolution of the city requiring the removal of its, the company's, poles and wires from the streets, impairs. And such was the decision of the District Court. The basis of the contention and decisions is that those ordinances superseded ordinance No. 135, taking the place of the latter, giving all the rights of a local exchange as the latter did and adding to them the rights of a long distance system; and this conclusion is deduced from the words of the ordinances and explanatory circumstances, the necessary connection, it is said, and the utility of the local system to the long distance system.\n First as to the title of the ordinances and the words of each that are said to be determinative of their meaning. The title of No. 174 is as follows:\n'An ordinance to grant permission to the Dakota Central Telephone Lines (Inc.), their successors and assigns, the right to erect poles and fixtures, and to string wires for the purpose of operating long distance telephone lines, within and through the city of Mitchell, South Dakota.'\n\n Section 1 provides that 'the right and privilege given' shall be for a period of twenty years 'for supplying the citizens of Mitchell, and the public in general, facilities to communicate by long distance telephone or other electrical devices with parties residing near or at a distance from Mitchell, and all such rights to be continued on the conditions therein named.'\n The title of ordinance No. 180 is exactly the same as \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 411]\n\u00a0\n that of No. 174, except that the word 'lines' of the latter is changed to the word 'system' by the former. Section 1 of No. 180 is the same as section 1 of No. 174, except certain immaterial changes and except the word 'in' in the provision expressing the purpose of the granted privilege to be 'to communicate by long distance telephone or other electrical devices, with parties residing in, near or at a distance from Mitchell . ...'\n Stress is put upon the words 'system,' 'within,' 'through,' 'in,' and 'near,' and it is insisted that they were necessarily intended to accommodate the residents of the city and to give them the facilities of local and long distance telephone service and that something more was intended than to give them a mere right to carry long distance telephone wires through the city.\n The contention has its strength and persuaded the District Court, but it is countervailed by other considerations. Undoubtedly the inducement of ordinances Nos. 174 and 180 was to give to the residents of the city long distance telephone facilities, but it cannot be said that granting such right inevitably or even naturally repealed or superseded the right to operate a local system which was given and then existed under ordinance No. 135, and which then had nine years to run. Besides, the decision of the Supreme Court is a factor of controlling strength. I explicitly decided that ordinances 135 and 180 had distinct purpose and operation and that the latter did not repeal or supersede the former. The issue was tendered by the company and the decision upon it is conclusive against the company.\n But if the decision be not given that extent, as it was not by the District Court, and if it be considered that the latter court had a right, as a federal court, to determine the existence of a contract and its elements, such right does not preclude a deference to the views of the state court, which, moveover, have the support of principles \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 412]\n\u00a0\n declared by this court, that grants of rights and privileges by the state or of any of its municipalities are strictly construed 'and whatever is not unequivocally granted is withheld; nothing passes by mere implication.' Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n200 \nU.S. 22, 34\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 224; Blair v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 400, 471\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 427.\n The contentions of the company in the case at bar rest entirely upon implication, the implication of a repeal of one ordinance by another, which is never favored, though the ordinances expressed different purposes and could, and did coexist for such purposes; and this implication is made to depend upon another, that is, that the ordinary meaning of the words 'long distance telephone' used in ordinance No. 180 is translated to signify and derive meaning from the function of the instrumentalities employed, such as transmitters, receivers, poles, wires, switching devices and battery systems, etc.\n We may conclude the discussion with the observation that if ordinance No. 180 had been intended to embrace and continue the right granted by ordinance No. 135 and to grant a further right of a long distance telephone system, there was a simple and direct way of doing it, clear to every understanding, and it would not have been left to be collected from disputable circumstances and the function of instruments known only to experts. At any rate, as it has been so left, the ambiguity resulting must be resolved against the telephone company. It should have taken care that the right it sought was clearly defined.\n It will be observed that the city expressly declares that it does not intend to interfere with or molest the telephone company in the maintenance and operation of the long distance system, and that the resolution or ordinance of which the company complains is directed only to the telephone system provided for in ordinance No. 135. After certain recitations and whereases it is \n\n[246 U.S. 396, 413]\n\u00a0\n as follows:\n'Be it further resolved that said Dakota Central Telephone Company be, and it is hereby notified and requested forthwith, on the 11th day of May, 1913, to remove from the streets, avenues, alleys and public grounds of the city of Mitchell, South Dakota, all of its poles, wires, cables, fixtures and apparatus of every kind and description used by it in the construction, maintenance and operation of its local telephone exchange or system in the city of Mitchell, South Dakota.'\n\n Whatever is necessary, therefore, for the maintenance and operation of the long distance system provided for in ordinance No. 180 is not intended to be disturbed. We must leave the adjustment, however, to the District Court.\n Decree of the District Court reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Be it resolved, by the city council of the city of Mitchell, South Dakota, that the right is hereby granted to the Dakota Central Telephone Company, their successors or assigns, to place, construct, and maintain through and under the streets, alleys and public grounds of said city all conduits, manholes and cables proper and necessary for supplying to the citizens of said city and the public in general communication by telephone and other improved appliances.' \n\n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCLEVELAND-CLIFFS IRON CO. v.

Belden, all of Cleveland, Ohio, for Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co.\n Messrs. S. W. Shaull, of Tropico, Cal., and C. C. Daniels, of New York City, for Arctic Iron Co.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The certificate upon which this case is before us contains what are denominated findings of fact grouped under eighteen paragraphs covering eight pages of the record. Upon these findings we are asked to instruct as to six propositions of law, really amounting to twelve since each is twofold, that is, stated in the alternative. But we are of opinion that we may not instruct as to these propositions for the following reasons:\n In the first place, because we think it is clear that the statements which are declared in the certificate to be findings of fact are in no true sense entitled to that characterization, since the statements amount but to a narrative of facts mixed with questions of law so interblended, the one with the other, as to cause it to be impossible to conclude as to either the law or the facts without a separation of the two, a duty which we may not be called upon to perform in giving instructions upon questions of law propounded under the statute controlling that subject.\n In the second place, because even if the admixture of law and fact which inheres in the recitals in the certificate be overlooked, the recitals nevertheless, in and of themselves, fail to distinguish between facts which are merely evidential and those which are ultimate and which for that reason would be susceptible of furnishing support \n\n[248 U.S. 178, 180]\n\u00a0\n for the legal propositions as to which instructions are asked.\n It is true, indeed, that the statute gives us the discretion, when a case is certified, to direct the sending up of the whole record, but obviously the exercise of that discretionary power is not called for by a case where the certificate is of such a character as not to be embraced by the statute.\n It must be, therefore, that this case affords no ground for directing the sending up of the whole record since here the certificate is inadequate to sustain the right to answer the questions stated. To hold to the contrary would be to cause a mistaken exercise of the right to certify specific questions to become the instrument by which the division of powers made by the statute would be disregarded.\n The views which we have stated are in accord with the settled rules concerning the power to certify which have prevailed from the beginning. See Dillon v. Strathearn Steamship Co., \n248 U.S. 182\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 83, this day decided, and the authorities therein cited. It follows that the certificate must be and is dismissed.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n I greatly regret that I cannot concur in the conclusion of the court just announced.\n That the certificate of the Circuit Court of Appeals is longer and more detailed than is usual is sufficiently explained by the unusual character of the facts in the case and of the questions of law involved. The certificate concludes with this statement:\n'However, we consider that No. 5 presents a question of law which is, in the view most favorable to plaintiff, the ultimate one; and we desire that this question be answered, without prejudice from the inclusion of others in this certificate, if it shall be thought that the inclusion of the \n\n[248 U.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n others is not in accordance with the practice of the supreme court in this respect.'\n\n Question No. 5 is in the alternative, viz.:\n'5a. When it appeared that the Cliffs had interests and desires pertaining to the new lease which might conflict with the course Kaufman and Breitung desired the Arctic to take, did the Cliffs and Mather perform every duty which by law rested upon him as director of the Arctic and through him upon the Cliffs when Mather withdrew from any further participation in the matter and notified Kaufman and Breitung that they could go ahead and make for the Arctic a contract satisfactory to them, and that the Cliffs and Mather would acquiesce therein? or\n\n'5b. Was it the duty of Mather as director in the Arctic, either to disclose to Kaufman and Breitung what he had done and the knowledge he had acquired as an officer of the Cliffs and on behalf of the Cliffs, or else to resign as a director in the Arctic?'\n\n While these two questions run into each other and could, perhaps, have been written as one, nevertheless, in my judgment, each presents a question of law, arising upon recited facts, and each is stated with sufficient precision to bring it within the terms of section 239 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [Comp. St. 1916,  1216]) and Rule 37 of this court (32 Sup. Ct. xiv), and I therefore think that these two questions, at least, should have been answered, or that this court should have required that the whole record of the case be sent up for its consideration. \n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOHN v.

Bennet, of Albany, Ga., Alexander Akerman and Charles Akerman, both of Macon, Ga., and John D. Pope and H. A. Peacock, both of Albany, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1902 and 1905 the bankrupt took out two policies on his life in the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company, loss under one payable to his 'executors, administrators or assigns,' under the other to his sister and brother with full power in the assured 'while this policy is in force and not previously assigned, to change the present beneficiary or beneficiaries.' By formal written instruments dated July 15, 1910, he assigned both policies to his wife 'if she outlives me, otherwise to may estate, with full power to the insured to change the beneficiary or surrender this policy to said company at any time, this to be done by instrument in writing under his hand and seal to be recorded at the home office of the company.'\n While both policies were in the bankrupt's possession, the trustee demanded them in order that their cash surrender value might be secured and distributed under Bankruptcy Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544 ( Comp. St.  9585-9656). The bankrupt defended upon two grounds: First, that the cash surrender value was not property which could have been transferred by him prior \n\n[248 U.S. 450, 452]\n\u00a0\n to bankruptcy; and, second, that the assignment to his wife could not be defeated by the trustee because protected by section 2498, Georgia Code 1910, which provides:\n'The assured may direct the money to be paid to his personal representative, or to his widow, or to his children, or to his assignee; and upon such direction given, and assented to by the insurer, no other person can defeat the same. But the assignment is good without such assent.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held both grounds of defense bad. 236 Fed. 882, 150 C. C. A. 144. As to the first its ruling accords with the doctrine recently announced in Cohen v. Samuels, \n245 U.S. 50\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 36. In respect of the second that court declared:\n'Nothing in the terms of the statute, especially when they are considered in the light of the circumstances of its enactment, indicates that it had any other purpose or effect than to deny to any one other than the assured himself the power to defeat a direction by him to pay to his personal representative, or to his widow, or to his children, or to his assignee, the money payable in a life policy issued to him. The provision does not purport to make every such direction by the assured irrevocable by him, or to invalidate a stipulation in a life policy giving the assured the right to change the beneficiary at any time during the continuance of the policy. The statute puts a direction by the assured to pay to his widow on the same footing as one to pay to his assignee. If a policy is assigned as security for a debt which the assured pays during his life, certainly the statute is not to be given the effect of putting it out of the power of the assured to change the beneficiary upon the reassignment of the policy to him by the satisfied creditor. Nothing in its terms justifies giving it a different operation or effect in the case of a direction to pay to the widow. We are not of opinion that the provision quoted had the effect of conferring on the \n\n[248 U.S. 450, 453]\n\u00a0\n bankrupt's wife, as the result of her having been named as the beneficiary, a vested and indefeasible interest in policies by the terms of which the beneficiaries could be changed by the bankrupt at any time.'\n\n And we approve its conclusion.\n Petitioner has not complained here of the action below concerning a third policy, issued by the New York Life Insurance Company.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOM.

Spooner, of New York City, for State of West Virginia.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 565, 589]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A rule allowed at the instance of Virginia against West Virginia to show cause why in default of payment of the judgment of this court in favor of the former state against the latter, an order should not be entered directing the levy of a tax by the Legislature of West Virginia to pay such judgment, and a motion by West Virginia to dismiss the rule is the matter before us.\n In the suit in which the judgment was rendered Virginia, invoking the original jurisdiction of this court, sought the enforcement of a contract by which it was averred West Virginia was bound. The judgment which resulted was for $12,393,929.50 with interest and it was based upon three propositions specifically found to be established: First, that when territory was carved out of the dominion of the state of Virginia for the purpose of constituting the area of the state of West Virginia, the new state, coincident with its existence, became bound for and assumed to pay its just proportion of the previous public debt of Virginia. Second, that this obligation of West Virginia was the subject of a contract between the two states made with the consent of Congress and was incorporated into the Constitution by which West Virginia was admitted by Congress into the Union and therefore became a condition of such admission and a part of the very governmental fiber of that state. Third, that the sum of the judgment rendered constituted the equitable proportion of this debt due by West Virginia in accordance with the obligations of the contract.\n The suit was commenced in 1906 and the judgment rendered in 1915. The various opinions expressed during the progress of the cause will be found in the reported \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 590]\n\u00a0\n cases cited in the margin,1 in the opinion in one of which (\n234 U.S. 117\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 889) a chronological statement of the incidents of the controversy was made.\n The opinions referred to will make it clear that both states were afforded the amplest opportunity to be heard and that all the propositions of law and fact urged were given the most solicitous consideration. Indeed, it is also true that in the course of the controversy, as demonstrated by the opinions cited, controlled by great consideration for the character of the parties, no technical rules were permitted to frustrate the right of both of the states to urge the very merits of every subject deemed by them to be material.\n And controlled by a like purpose before coming to discharge our duty in the matter now before us we have searched the record in vain for any indication that the assumed existence of any error committed has operated to prevent the discharge by West Virginia of the obligations resulting from the judgment and hence has led to the proceeding to enforce the judgment which is now before us. In saying this however we are not unmindful that the record contains a suggestion of an alleged claim of West Virginia against the United States, which was not remotely referred to while the suit between the two states was undetermined, the claim referred to being based on an assumed violation of trust by the United States in the administration of what was left of the great domain of the Northwest Territory-a domain as to which, before the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, Virginia at the request of Congress transferred to the government of the Confederation all her right, title and interest in order to allay discord between the states, as New York had previously done and as Massachusetts, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 591]\n\u00a0\n subsequently did. \n2\n It is obvious that the subject was referred to in connection with the duty of West Virginia to comply with the requirements of the judgment upon the hypothesis that if the United States owed the claim and if in a suit against the United States recovery could be had, and if West Virginia received its share, it might be used, if sufficient, for discharging the judgment and thus save West Virginia from resorting to other means for so doing.\n That judicial power essentially involves the right to enforce the results of its exertion is elementary. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 23; Bank of the United States v. Halstead, 10 Wheat. 57; Gordon v. United States, \n117 U.S. 697\n, 702. And that this applies to the exertion of such power in controversies between states as the result of the exercise of original jurisdiction conferred upon this court by the Constitution is therefore certain. The many cases in which such controversies between states have been decided in the exercise of original jurisdiction make this truth manifest. \n3\n Nor is there room for con- \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 592]\n\u00a0\n tending to the contrary because in all the cases cited the states against which judgments were rendered conformably to their duty under the Constitution voluntarily respected and gave effect to the same. This must be unless it can be said that because a doctrine has been universally recognized as being beyond dispute and has hence hitherto in every case from the foundation of the government been accepted and applied, it has by that fact alone now become a fit subject for dispute.\n It is true that in one of the cited cases (South Dakota v. North Carolina, \n192 U.S. 286\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 269) it was remarked that doubt had been expressed in some instances by individual judges as to whether the original jurisdiction conferred on the court by the Constitution embraced the right of one state to recover a judgment in a mere action for debt against another. In that case, however, it is apparent that the court did not solve such suggested doubt, as that question was not involved in the case then before it and that subject was hence left open to be passed on in the future when the occasion required. But the question thus left open has no bearing upon and does not require to be considered in the case before us, first, because the power to render the judgment as between the two states whose enforcement is now under consideration is as to them foreclosed by the fact of i  rendition. And second, because while the controversy between the states culminated in a decree for money and that subject was within the issues, nevertheless the generating cause of the controversy was the carving out of the dominion of one of the states the area composing the other and the resulting and expressly assumed obligation of the newly created state to pay the just proportion of the pre-existing debt, an ob- \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 593]\n\u00a0\n ligation which as we have seen rested in contract between the two states, consented to by Congress and expressed in substance as a condition in the Constitution by which the new state was admitted into the Union. In making this latter statement we do not overlook the truism that the Union under the Constitution is essentially one of states equal in local governmental power which therefore excludes the conception of an inequality of such power resulting from a condition of admission into the Union. Ward v. Race Horse, \n163 U.S. 504\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 1076. But this principle has no application to the question of power to enforce against a state when admitted into the Union a contract entered into by it with another state with the consent of Congress since such question but concerns the equal operation upon all the states of a limitation upon them all imposed by the Constitution and the equal application of the authority conferred upon Congress to vivify and give effect by its consent to contracts entered into between states.\n Both parties admit that West Virginia is the owner of no property not used for governmental purposes and that therefore from the mere issue of an execution the judgment is not susceptible of being enforced if under such execution property actually devoted to immediate governmental uses of the state may not be taken. Passing a decision as to the latter question, all the contentions on either side will be disposed of by considering two subjects: first, the limitations on the right to enforce inhering in the fact that the judgment is against a state and its enforcement against such governmental being; and second, the appropriateness of the form of procedure applicable for such enforcement. The solution of these subjects may be disposed of by answering two questions which we propose to separately state and consider.\n\n 1. \nMay a judgment rendered against a state as a state be enforced against it as such, including the right to the ex- \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 594]\n\u00a0\n tent necessary for so doing of exerting authority over the governmental powers and agencies possessed by the state?\n On this subject Virginia contends that as the Constitution subjected the state of West Virginia to judicial authority at the suit of the state of Virginia, the judgment which was rendered in such a suit binds and operates upon the state of West Virginia, that is, upon that state in a governmental capacity, including all instrumentalities and agencies of state power, and indirectly binding the whole body of the citizenship of that state and the property which by the exertion of powers possessed by the state are subject to be reached for the purpose of meeting and discharging the state obligation. As then, the contention proceeds, the Legislature of West Virginia possesses the power to tax and that body and its powers are all operated upon by the judgment, the inability to enforce by means of ordinary process of execution gives the right and sanctions the exertion of the authority to enforce the judgment by compelling the Legislature to exercise its power of taxation. The significance of the contention and its scope are aptly illustrated by the reference in argument to the many decided cases holding that where a municipality is empowered to levy specified taxation to pay a particular debt, the judicial power may enforce the levy of the tax to meet a judgment rendered in consequence of a default in paying the indebtedness. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n On the other hand, West Virginia insists that the defendant as a state may not as to its powers of government reserved to it by the Constit tion be controlled or limited by process for the purpose of enforcing the \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 595]\n\u00a0\n payment of the judgment. Because the right for that end is recognized to obtain an execution against a state and levy it upon its property, if any, not used for governmental purposes, it is argued, affords no ground for upholding the power by compelled exercise of the taxing authority of the state to create a fund which may be used when collected for paying the judgment. The rights reserved to the states by the Constitution, it is further insisted, may not be interfered with by the judicial power merely because that power has been given authority to adjudicate at the instance of one state a right asserted against another, since although the authority to enforce the adjudication may not be denied, execution to give effect to that authority is restrained by the provisions of the Constitution which recognize state governmental power.\n Mark, in words a common premise-a judgment against a state and the authority to enforce it-is the predicate upon which is rested on the one hand the contention as to the existence of complete and effective, and the assertion on the other of limited and inefficacious power. But it is obvious that the latter can only rest upon either treating the word 'state' as used in the premise as embracing only a misshapen or dead entity, that is, a state stripped for the purpose of judicial power of all its governmental authority, or if not, by destroying or dwarfing the significance of the word 'state' as describing the entity subject to enforcement, or both. It needs no argument to demonstrate that both of these theories are incompatible with and destructive of the very numerous cases decided by this court to which we have referred. As it is certain that governmental powers reserved to the states by the Constitution-their sovereignty-were the efficient cause of the general rule by which they were not subject to judicial power, that is, to be impleaded, it must follow that when the Constitution gave original \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 596]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction to this court to entertain at the instance of one state a suit against another it must have been intended to modify the general rule, that is, to bring the states and their governmental authority within the exceptional judicial power which was created. No other rational explanation can be given for the provision. And the context of the Constitution, that is, the express prohibition which it contains as to the power of the states to contract with each other except with the consent of Congress, the limitations as to war and armies, obviously intended to prevent any of the states from resorting to force for the redress of any grievance real or imaginary, all harmonize with and give force to this conception of the operation and effect of the right to exert, at the prayer of one state, judicial authority over another.\n But it is in substance said this view must be wrong for two reasons: ( a) Because it virtually overrides the provision of the Constitution reserving to the states the powers not delegated, by the provision making a grant of judicial power for the purpose of disposing of controversies between states; and (b) because it gives to the Constitution a construction incompatible with its plain purpose, which was while creating the nation, yet at the same time to preserve the states with their governmental authority in order that state and nation might endure. Ultimately the argument at its best but urges that the text of the Constitution be disregarded for fear of supposed consequences to arise from enforcing it. And it is difficult to understand upon what ground of reason the preservation of the rights of all the states can be predicated upon the assumption that any one state may destroy the rights of any other without any power to redress or cure the resulting grievance. Nor further can it be readily understood why it is assumed that the preservation and perpetuation of the Constitution depend upon the ab- \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 597]\n\u00a0\n sence of all power to preserve and give effect to the great guaranties which safeguard the authority and preserve the rights of all the states.\n Besides, however, the manifest error of the propositions which these considerations expose, their want of merit will be additionally demonstrated by the history of the institutions from which the provisions of the Constitution under review were derived and by bringing into view the evils which they were intended to remedy and the rights which it was contemplated their adoption would secure.\n Bound by a common allegiance and absolutely controlled in their exterior relations by the mother county, the colonies before the Revolution were yet as regards each other practically independent, that is, distinct one from the other. Their common intercourse more or less frequent, the contiguity of their boundaries, their conflicting claims in many instances of authority over undefined and outlying territory, of necessity brought about conflicting contentions between them. As these contentions became more and more irritating, if not seriously acute, the necessity for the creation of some means of settling them became more and more urgent if physical conflict was to be avoided. And for this reason, it is to be assumed, it early came to pass that differences between the colonies were taken to the Privy Council for settlement and were there considered and passed upon during a long period of years, the sanction afforded to the conclusions of that body being the entire power of the realm, whether exerted through the medium of a royal decree or legislation by Parliament. This power, it is undoubtedly true, was principally called into play in cases of disputed boundary, but that it was applied also to the complaint of an individual against a colony concerning the wrongful possession of property by the colony alleged to belong to him is not disputed. This general situation as to the disputes between the colonies and the power to dispose of them by \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 598]\n\u00a0\n the Privy Council was stated in Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 739, et seq., and will be found reviewed in the authorities referred to in the margin. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n When the Revolution came and the relations with the mother country were severed, indisputably controversies between some of the colonies of the greatest moment to them had been submitted to the Privy Council and were undetermined. The necessity for their consideration and solution was obviously not obscured by the struggle for independence which ensued, for, by the ninth of the Articles of Confederation an attempt to provide for them as well as for future controversies was made. Without going into detail it suffices to say that that article in express terms declared the Congress to be the final arbiter of controversies between the states and provided machinery for bringing into play a tribunal which had power to decide the same. That these powers were exerted concerning controversies between the states of the most serious character again cannot be disputed. But the mechanism devised for their solution proved unavailing because of a want of power in Congress to enforce the findings of the body charged with their solution, a deficiency of power which was generic because resulting from the limited authority over the states conferred by the Articles of Confederation on Congress as to every subject. That this absence of power to control the governmental attributes of the states for the purpose of enforcing findings concerning disputes between them gave rise to the most serious consequences and brought the states to the very verge of physical struggle and resulted in the shedding of blood and would, if it had not been for the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, it \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 599]\n\u00a0\n may be reasonably assumed, have rendered nugatory the great results of the Revolution, is known to all and will be found stated in the authoritative works on the history of the time. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Throwing this light upon the constitutional provisions, the conferring on th  court of original jurisdiction over controversies between states, the taking away of all authority as to war and armies from the states and granting it to Congress, the prohibiting the states also from making agreements or compacts with each other without the consent of Congress, at once makes clear how completely the past infirmities of power were in mind and were provided against. This result stands out in the boldest possible relief when it is borne in mind that not a want of authority in Congress to decide controversies between states, but the absence of power in Congress to enforce as against the governments of the states its decisions on such subjects, was the evil that cried aloud for cure, since it must be patent that the provisions written into the Constitution, the power which was conferred upon Congress and the judicial power as to states created, joined with the prohibitions placed upon the states, all combined to unite the authority to decide with the power to enforce-a unison which could only have arisen from contemplating the dangers of the past and the unalterable purpose to prevent their recurrence in the future. And, while it may not materially add to the demonstration of the result stated, it may serve a useful purpose to direct attention to the probable operation of tradition upon the mind of the framers, shown by the fact that, harmonizing with the practice which prevailed during the colonial period in the \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 600]\n\u00a0\n Privy Council, the original jurisdiction as conferred by the Constitution on this court embraced not only controversies between states but between private individuals and a state-a power which following its recognition in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, was withdrawn by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment. The fact that in the Convention, so far as the published debates disclose, the provisions which we are considering were adopted without debate, it may be inferred, resulted from the necessity of their enactment as shown by the experience of the colonies and by the specter of turmoil if not war which, as we have seen, had so recently arisen from the disputes between the states, a danger against the recurrence of which there was a common purpose efficiently to provide. And it may well be that a like mental condition accounts for the limited expressions concerning the provisions in question in the proceedings for the ratification of the Constitution which followed, although there are not wanting one or two instances where they were referred to which when rightly interpreted make manifest the purposes which we have stated. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The state, then, as a governmental entity having been subjected by the Constitution to the judicial power under the conditions stated, and the duty to enforce the judgment by resort to appropriate remedies being certain even although their exertion may operate upon the governmental powers of the State, we are brought to consider the second question, which is:\n\n 2. \nWhat are the appropriate remedies for such enforcement?\n Back of the consideration of what remedies are appropriate, whether looked at from the point of view of the exertion of equitable power or the application of legal remedies extraordinary in character (mandamus, etc.) lies \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 601]\n\u00a0\n the question what ordinary remedies are available, and that subject must necessarily be disposed of. As the powers to render the judgment and to enforce it arise from the grant in the Constitution on that subject, looked at from a generic point of view, both are federal powers, and comprehensively considered are sustained by every authority of the federal government, judicial, legislative or executive, which may be appropriately exercised. And confining ourselves to a determination of what is appropriate in view of the particular judgment in this cause, two questions naturally present themselves: (a) The power of Congress to legislate to secure the enforcement of the contract between the states; and (b) the appropriate remedies which may by the j dicial power be exerted to enforce the judgment. We again consider them separately.\n\n\n (a)\n The power of Congress to legislate for the enforcement of the obligation of West Virginia.\n The vesting in Congress of complete power to control agreements between states, that is, to authorize them when deemed advisable and to refuse to sanction them when disapproved, clearly rested upon the conception that Congress as the repository, not only of legislative power, but of primary authority to maintain armies and declare war, speaking for all the states and for their protection, was concerned with such agreements, and therefore was virtually endowed with the ultimate power of final agreement which was withdrawn from state authority and brought within the federal power. It follows as a necessary implication that the power of Congress to refuse or to assent to a contract between states carried with it the right, if the contract was assented to and hence became operative by the will of Congress, to see to its enforcement. This must be the case unless it can be said that the duty of exacting the carrying out of a contract is not, within the principle of McCulloch v. Maryland, \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 602]\n\u00a0\n 4 Wheat. 316, relevant to the power to determine whether the contract should be made. But the one is so relevant to the other as to leave no room for dispute to the contrary.\n Having thus the power to provide for the execution of the contract, it must follow that the power is plenary and complete, limited of course as we have just said by the general rule that the acts done for its exertion must be relevant and appropriate to the power. This being true it further follows, as we have already seen, that by the very fact that the national power is paramount in the area over which it extends, the lawful exertion of its authority by Congress to compel compliance with the obligation resulting from the contract between the two states which it approved is not circumscribed by the powers reserved to the states. Indeed the argument that the recognition of such a power in Congress is subversive of our constitutional institutions from its mere statements proves to the contrary, since at last it comes to insisting that any one state may by violating its obligations under the Constitution take away the rights of another and thus destroy constitutional government. Obviously if it be conceded that no power obtains to enforce as against a state its duty under the Constitution in one respect and to prevent it from doing wrong to another state, it would follow that the same principle would have to be applied to wrongs done by other states, and thus the government under the Constitution would be not an indissoluble union of indestructible states but a government composed of states each having the potency with impunity to wrong or degrade another-a result which would inevitably lead to a destruction of the union between them. Besides it must be apparent that to treat the power of Congress to legislate to secure the performance by a state of its duty under the Constitution, that is, its continued respect for and obedience to that instrument, as coercion, comes back \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 603]\n\u00a0\n at last to the theory that any one state may throw off and disregard without sanction its obligation and subjection to the Constitution. A conclusion which brings at once to the mind the thought that to maintain the proposition now urged by West Virginia would compel a disregard of the very principles which led to the carving out of that state from the territory of Virginia; in other words, to disregard and overthrow the doctrines irrevocably settled by the great controversy of the Civil War, which in their ultimate aspect find their consecration in the amendments to the Constitution which followed.\n Nor is there any force in the suggestion that the existence of the power in Congress to legislate for the enforcement of a contract made by a state under the circumstances here under consideration is incompatible with the grant of origina jurisdiction to this court to entertain a suit between the states on the same subject. The two grants in no way conflict but co-operate and co-ordinate to a common end; that is, the obedience of a state to the Constitution by performing the duty which that instrument exacts. And this is unaffected by the fact that the power of Congress to exert its legislative authority as we have just stated it also extends to the creation of new remedies in addition to those provided for by section 14 of the Judiciary Act Sept. 24, 1789 (1 Stat. 81, c. 20, now section 262, Judicial Code [Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1162; Comp. St. 1916,  1239]) to meet the exigency occasioned by the judicial duty of enforcing a judgment against a state under the circumstances as here disclosed. We say this because we think it is apparent that to provide by legislative action additional process relevant to the enforcement of judicial authority is the exertion of a legislative and not the exercise of a judicial power.\n This leaves only the second aspect of the question now under consideration.\n\n\n (b)\n The appropriate remedies under existing legislation.\n The remedy sought, as we have at the outset seen, is \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 604]\n\u00a0\n an order in the nature of mandamus commanding the levy by the Legislature of West Virginia of a tax to pay the judgment. In so far as the duty to award that remedy is disputed merely because authority to enforce a judgment against a state may not affect state power, the contention is adversely disposed of by what we have said. But this does not dispose of all the contentions between the parties on the subject, since on the one hand it is insisted that the existence of a discretion in the Legislature of West Virginia as to taxation precludes the possibility of issuing the order, and on the other hand it is contended that the duty to give effect to the judgment against the state, operating upon all state powers, excludes the legislative discretion asserted and gives the resulting right to compel. But we are of opinion that we should not now dispose of such question and should also now leave undetermined the further question, which as the result of the inherent duty resting on us to give effect to the judicial power exercised we have been led to consider on our own motion; that is, whether there is power to direct the levy of a tax adequate to pay the judgment and provide for its enforcement irrespective of state agencies. We say this because, impelled now by the consideration of the character of the parties which has controlled us during the whole course of the litigation, the right judicially to enforce by appropriate proceedings as against a state and its governmental agencies having been determined, and the constitutional power of Congress to legislate in a twofold way having been also pointed out, we are fain to believe that if we refrain now from passing upon the questions stated, we may be spared in the future the necessity of exerting compulsory power against one of the states of the Union to compel it to discharge a plain duty resting upon it under the Constitution. Indeed, irrespective of these considerations, upon the assumption that both the re- \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 605]\n\u00a0\n quirements of duty and the suggestions of selfinterest may fail to bring about the result stated, we are nevertheless of the opinion that we should not now finally dispose of the case, but because of the character of the parties and the nature of the controversy, a contract approved by Congress and subject to be by it enforced, we should reserve further action in order that full opportunity may be afforded to Congress to exercise the power which it undoubtedly possesses.\n Giving effect to this view, accepting the things which are irrevocably foreclosed-briefly stated, the judgment against the state operating upon it in all its governmental powers and the duty to enforce it viewed in that aspect-our conclusion is that the case should be restored to the docket for further argument at the next term after the February rece s. Such argument will embrace the three questions left open: 1. The right under the conditions previously stated to award the mandamus prayed for. 2. If not, the power and duty to direct the levy of a tax as stated. 3. If means for doing so be found to exist, the right, if necessary, to apply such other and appropriate equitable remedy by dealing with the funds or taxable property of West Virginia or the rights of that state as may secure an execution of the judgment. In saying this, however, to the end that if on such future hearing provided for the conclusion should be that any of the processes stated are susceptible of being lawfully applied (repeating that we do not now decide such questions) occasion for a further delay may not exist, we reserve the right, if deemed advisable, at a day hereafter before the end of the term or at the next term before the period fixed for the hearing, to appoint a master for the purpose of examining and reporting concerning the amount and method of taxation essential to be put into effect, whether by way of order to the state Legislature or direct action, to secure the full execution of the \n\n[246 U.S. 565, 606]\n\u00a0\n judgment, as well as concerning the means otherwise existing in the state of West Virginia, if any, which by the exercise of the equitable powers in the discharge of the duty to enforce payment may be available for that purpose.\n And it is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Virginia v.

WOOD(1918)\nNo. 833\nArgued: Decided: May 6, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Hannis Taylor, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, conformably to the Selective Draft Law of May 18, 1917 ( 40 Stat. 76, c. 15), was called to compulsory military duty and in December, 1917, was \n\n[247 U.S. 3, 4]\n\u00a0\n engaged in performing it at Camp Funston, Kansas. On the 3d of that month he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to be directed to the general commanding the camp to discharge him from further service. The ground of the petition was that although Congress had the power to call the citizens of the United States, the national militia, to compulsory service in virtue of the militia clause of the Constitution (article 1,  8), that power was limited to the character of services specified in the militia clause, viz.: 'To execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.' Further alleging that it had been officially declared that the call to service for which the draft had been made under the act was avowedly for the purpose of military duty in a foreign country, it was charged that the call was illegal and the right to the writ existed. Before the allowance of a rule on the petition, through the United States district attorney the general who was named as respondent in the petition moved to dismiss because the facts alleged constituted no ground for the relief which was prayed and hence as a return stating such facts would require a discharge of the rule for habeas corpus if issued, none should be ordered. On the 20th of December the matter was submitted by consent of the United States district attorney and the petitioner to the court for its action upon the petition and the motion to dismiss. On the 4th of January, 1918, the court sustained the motion of the district attorney and dismissed the petition. In the opinion by which this conclusion was sustained it was pointed out, conformably to the statement which we have made concerning the petition that the--\n'petitioner, after affirming the validity of said Conscription Act of May 18, 1917, pleads what he calls his constitutional immunity from military service beyond the territorial limits of the United States. Such claim of constitutional immunity rests upon the contention that no conscription act can be \n\n[247 U.S. 3, 5]\n\u00a0\n passed except under that part of section 8, art. 1, of the Constitution which provides that 'the Congress shall have power ... to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.' ...'\n\n On the day the judgment was rendered, January 4th, an appeal to this court was prayed and allowed, the assignments of error then made for that purpose reasserting the want of power in Congress to require a citizen to render compulsory military service beyond the territorial limits of the United States.\n When on December 3d the petition was filed in the lower court, various cases calling in question the constitutionality of the Selective Draft Law of May 18, 1917, were on the docket of this court and approaching hearing and were argued here on December 13th and 14th before the decision below was rendered, January 4th, sustaining the motion to dismiss. Before that argument, however, at the request of counsel for the present appellant permission was given to file a brief in those cases as a friend of the court and such brief was filed and considered in passing upon the cases which were decided on January 7, 1918. Selective Draft Cases, \n245 U.S. 366\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 159, 62 L. Ed. --.\n Coming to consider the elaborate contentions and arguments supporting them made in the present case, it is indisputable that they all rest upon the assumption as to the exclusive character of the delegation made to Congress by the militia clause (article 1,  8) and the restriction as to the use of the military force raised under such delegation resulting from the provisions in the clause relied upon, that is, the prohibition of compulsory service beyond the territorial limits of the United States. But we are of opinion that we are not now called upon to consider these contentions as a matter of original inquiry because the fundamental mistake upon which all the \n\n[247 U.S. 3, 6]\n\u00a0\n arguments rest and the error in the conclusion which they are advanced to sustain were pointed out and conclusively established by the decision sustaining the Selective Draft Law recently announced in the Selective Draft Cases, \n245 U.S. 366\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 159, 62 L. Ed. --. This result is apparent since on the face of the opinion delivered in those cases the constitutional power of Congress to compel the military service which the assailed law commanded was based on the following propositions: (a) That the power of Congress to compel military service and the duty of the citizen to render it when called for were derived from the authority given to Congress by the Constitution to declare war and to raise armies. (b) That those powers were not qualified or restricted by the provisions of the militia clause and hence the authority in the exercise of the war power to raise armies and use them when raised was not subject to limitations as to use of the militia, if any, deduced from the militia clause. And (c) that from these principles it also follows that the power to call for military duty under the authority to declare war and raise armies and the duty of the citizen to serve when called were coterminous with the constitutional grant from which the authority was derived and knew no limit deduced from a separate and for the purpose of the war power wholly incidental if not irrelevant and subordinate provision concerning the militia found in the Constitution. Our duty to affirm is therefore made clear.\n But before so ordering we must notice a suggestion made by the government that because of impertinent and scandalous passages contained in the brief of the appellant the brief should be stricken from the files. Consi ering the passages referred to and making every allowance for intensity of zeal and an extreme of earnestness on the part of counsel, we are nevertheless constrained to the conclusion that the passages justify the terms of censure by which they are characterized in the \n\n[247 U.S. 3, 7]\n\u00a0\n suggestion made by the government. But despite this conclusion which we regretfully reach, we see no useful purpose to be subserved by granting the motion to strike. On the contrary we think the passages on their face are so obviously intemperate and so patently unwarranted that if as a result of permitting the passages to remain on the files they should come under future observation, they would but serve to indicate to what intemperance of statement an absence of self-restraint or forgetfulness of decorum will lead and therefore admonish of the duty to be sedulous to obey and respect the limitations which an adhesion to them must exact.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCRAMP & SONS v. CURTIS TURBINE CO.(1918)\nNo. 393\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 28, 29]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Clifton V. Edwards, of New York City, and Abraham M. Beitler, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 28, 33]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederick P. Fish, Charles Neave, and William G. McKnight, all of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 28, 35]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The history of this suit from its commencement up to the development of the controversy now before us, will be shown by an examination of the decided cases referred to in the margin. \n1\n We shall therefore not recur to that which has gone before but confine our statement to the things essential to an understanding of the phase of the issue which we must now decide.\n Under proposals submitted by the Navy Department the petitioner, the Cramp Company, in 1908 contracted to build two torpedo boat destroyers, Nos. 30 and 31, and in 1911 further contracted to build four such boats, Nos. 47, 48, 49 and 50. The specifications submitted by the department as to structure, engines, etc., were comprehensively detailed and the contracts were based either upon the acceptance of such specifications or upon such changes suggested by the contractor as met the approval of the Navy Department. The contracts contained an express provision, which is in the margin,2 protecting the govern- \n\n[246 U.S. 28, 36]\n\u00a0\n ment against any claims which might arise from the infringement by the contractor of the rights of any patentee, if any such rights there were.\n The Turbine Companies filed their bill against the Cramp Company to recover damages and profits accruing from the infringement of certain patents on turbine engines which the Cramp Company had placed in the boats built under the contract of 1908. Ultimately this claim of infringement was upheld by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 211 Fed. 124, 127 C. C. A. 522. On the hearing which then ensued before a master as to damages and profits, the Turbine Companies urged their claim and tendered their proof concerning the same, covering the four destroyers, Nos. 47, 48, 49 and 50, built under the contract of 1911, upon the ground of an infringement like that which had been committed as to the boats built under the contract of 1908. Rubber Co. v. Goodyear, 9 Wall. 805. The inquiry was objected to on the ground of its irrelevancy because liability for infringement under the contract of 1911 was to be tested by a different rule from that which was applicable to the boats contracted for in 1908 in consequence of the applicability to the 1911 contracts of the Act of Congress of June 25, 1910, c. 423, 36 Stat. 851. Under that law, it was insisted:\n'The United States, by act of eminent domain, acquired a license to use the invention of all existing patents, and, therefore, the transactions under the contracts for torpedo boat destroyers Nos. 47, 48, 49 and 50, being merely the building of devices for a licensee under the patent in suit, were licensed transactions, and consequently are not within the scope of this accounting.'\n\n The master overruled the objection but thereafter on request certified the subject to \n\n[246 U.S. 28, 37]\n\u00a0\n the District Court where his ruling was held to be wrong on its merits and reversed. On a rehearing the court sustained the view which it had previously taken of the subject by a reference to a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. v. Simon (D. C.) 227 Fed. 906; Id., 231 Fed. 1021, 145 C. C. A. 656; (D. C.) 232 Fed. 166. Application was then made to the Circuit Court of Appeals by certiorari to review this ruling and by mandamus to compel the master to proceed with the hearing in accordance with the claims of the Turbine Companies. Finding that the ruling in the Marconi Case was pending in this court for review, the Court of Appeals postponed deciding the issue of statutory construction to await the decision of this court, but directed the accounting to proceed as to both classes of contracts in such a manner as to enable the authoritative ruling on the statute when made by this court to be applied without confusion or delay. 238 Fed. 564, 151 C. C. A. 500. The writ of certiorari on which the case is now before us was then allowed and this and the Marconi Case referred to by the court below were argued and submitted upon the same day.\n The single question is, did the provisions of the Act of 1910 operate without more to confer upon the United States a license to use the patents of the Turbine Companies; and if so, was the Cramp Company as a contractor authorized to avail itself of the license by using the patent rights of the Turbine Companies without their consent? Avowedly on the very face of the act its purpose was not to weaken the rights of patentees, but to further secure them. This results not only from the title of the law (An act to provide additional protection for owners of patents of the United States, and for other purposes), but further from the report of the committee of the House of Representatives where the act originated which stated that such was the purpose intended to be accomplished \n\n[246 U.S. 28, 38]\n\u00a0\n by the act. (House Report No. 1288, 61st Congress, 3d Session.) The conflict between the purpose thus intended and the construction now claimed for the act is evident unless it can be said that to confer by anticipation upon the United States by a law universally and automatically operating a license to use every patent right is a means of giving effect to a provision of a statute avowedly intended for the further securing and protecting of such patent rights.\n But passing deducing the meaning of the act from its title and the report of the committee by which it was drafted, it is apparent that the significance which the contention affixes to it is directly in conflict with the text (which is in the margin3), since that text expressly declares that the object of the act is to secure compensation for patentees whose rights have been 'used by the United States without license'-the very antithesis of a right by license o use all patents which is the purpose attrib- \n\n[246 U.S. 28, 39]\n\u00a0\n uted to the act by the argument. And this is made clearer by considering that the statute itself in directing the proceedings which must be resorted to in order to accomplish its avowed purpose, exacts the judicial ascertainment of conditions which would be wholly negligible and irrelevant upon the assumption that the statute intended to provide in favor of the United States the general license right which the argument attributes to it. This conclusion cannot be escaped when it is considered that if the license, which it is insisted the act in advance created, obtained in favor of the United States, the inquiry into the question of infringement by the United States for which the statute provides would be wholly superfluous and indeed inconsistent with the assumption of the existence of the supposed license.\n But let us in addition pass these latter considerations and come not only to demonstrate the error of the construction asserted but to make manifest the true meaning of the statute from a twofold point of view; that is, first, from an analysis of the context of the statute as elucidated by the indisputable principles which at the time of the adoption of the act governed the subjects with which it dealt, and, second, from the consideration of the context and the effect upon it of the ruling in Crozier v. Krupp, \n224 U.S. 290\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 488.\n At the time of the enactment of the law of 1910 the following principles were so indisputably established as to need no review of the authorities sustaining them, although the leading cases as to all the propositions are referred to in the margin. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n (a)\n That rights secured under the grant of letters pat- \n\n[246 U.S. 28, 40]\n\u00a0\n ent by the United States were property and protected by the guarantees of the Constitution and not subject therefore to be appropriated even for public use without adequate compensation.\n\n\n (b)\n That although the United States was not subject to be sued and therefore could not be impleaded because of an alleged wrongful taking of such rights by one of its officers, nevertheless a person attempting to take such property in disregard of the constitutional guarantees was subject as a wrongdoer to be controlled to the extent necessary to prevent the violation of the Constitution. But it was equally well settled as to patent rights, as was the case with all others, that the right to proceed against an individual, even although an officer, to prevent a violation of the Constitution did not include the right to disregard the Constitution by awarding relief which could not rightfully be granted without impleading the United States, or, what is equivalent thereto, without interfering with the property of the United States possessed or used for the purpose of its governmental functions.\n\n\n (c)\n That despite the want of authority to implead the United States, yet where an officer of the United States, within the scope of an official authority vested in him to deal with a particular subject, having knowledge of existing patent rights and of their validity, appropriated them for the benefit of the United States by the consent of the owner, express or implied, upon the conception that compensation would be thereafter provided, the owner of the patent right taken under such circumstances might, under the statute law of the United States permitting suits against the United States on contracts express or implied, recover by way of implied contract the compensation which might be rightly exacted because of such taking.\n\n\n (d)\n That where an officer of the United States in dealing with a subject within the scope of his authority infringed patent rights by a taking or use of property for \n\n[246 U.S. 28, 41]\n\u00a0\n the benefit of the United States without the conditions stated justifying the implication of a contract, however serious might be the infringement or grave to the holder of the rights the consequences of such infringement, the only redress of the owner was again t the officer, since no ground for implying a contract and securing compensation from the United States obtained.\n Coming to consider the statute in the light of these principles, there would seem to be no room for controversy that the direct and simple provision, 'that whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of the United States shall hereafter be used by the United States without license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use the same, such owner may recover reasonable compensation for such use by suit in the Court of Claims,' embraces and was intended alone to provide for the discrepancy resulting from the divergence between the right in one case to sue on an implied contract and the non-existence of a right to sue in another. And this meaning becomes irresistible when the concordance which it produces between the title and the report of the committee is considered on the one hand, and the discord which would arise on the other from reading into the statute the theory of automatic and general license as to every patent which the argument presses. Observe that the right to recover by implied contract as existing prior to 1910 and the right to recover given by that act both rest upon the possession and exertion of official authority, although from the absence of definition in the statute the precise scope of the official power possessed in order to bring the authority into play is not specified but is left to be deduced from the application of general principles. Observe further that, resting thus upon the exercise of official power it was not assumed before the act of 1910 or under that act, that the official authority would consciously and intentionally be exerted so as to violate the Constitution \n\n[246 U.S. 28, 42]\n\u00a0\n by wrongfully appropriating private property. This follows from a twofold point of view: First, because the basis of the right to sue on implied contract is the fact that official power recognizing the patent right and the at least implied assent of the owner, had acted in reliance upon the fact that adequate compensation would follow the taking. And second, because in conferring the right to prove infringement, the act of 1910 obviously contemplates the possibility of the commission of official error or mistake on that subject and afforded a remedy for its correction and resulting compensation. Thus it is true to say that under both views the theory of its universal and automatic appropriation by the United States of a license to use all patent rights is unsupported, since both views assume that official authority would not be willfully exerted so as to violate the Constitution, and this although it be that the act of 1910 embraces the exceptional case where, because of some essential governmental exigency or public necessity, the authority of the United States is exerted to take patent rights under eminent domain in reliance upon the provision to recover the adequate compensation which the act of 1910 affords. And this fundamental characteristic at once exposes the want of foundation for the contention that because the statute made provision for giving effect to acts of official power in taking patent rights under the conditions stated and even when necessary of curing defects in the exertion of such power, therefore it is to be assumed that the statute conferred upon all who contracted with the United States for the performance of work a right to disregard and take without compensation the property of patentees. This must be, since the making of a contract with the United States to perform duties in favor of the United States does not convert the contractor into an official of the United States qualified to represent it and to entail obligations on it which under the terms of the statute can alone rest \n\n[246 U.S. 28, 43]\n\u00a0\n upon official action and the discharge of official duty. The and the resulting obligation to perform and the resulting obligation to perform duties in favor of the United States by necessary implication impose the responsibility of performance in accordance with the law of the land; that is, without disregarding the rights or appropriating the property of others. A contractor with the United States, therefore, is in the very nature of things bound to discharge the obligation of his contract without violating the rights of others, and merely because he contracts with the United States is not vested with the power to take the property of others upon the assumption that as a result of the contract with the United States he enjoys the right to exercise public and governmental powers possessed by the United States.\n Nor is there any foundation for the assumption that the ruling in Crozier v. Krupp, \n224 U.S. 290\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 488, is in conflict with these self-evident propositions and by necessary implication sanctions the theory of universal license in favor of the United States as to all patent rights and the asserted resulting authority in contractors with the United States for the purpose of the execution of their contracts to disregard and appropriate all such rights.\n Stated as briefly as we possibly can the case was this: In the arsenals of the United States guns and gun carriages were constructed containing appliances which it was asserted infringed patent rights of the Krupp Company. A bill was filed against Crozier, who was Chief of Ordinance of the United States, to enjoin the alleged violation of the asserted patent rights. Crozier demurred to the amended bill on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction because the suit was one against the United States. The trial court dismissed the bill. The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia reversed because, although it fully conceded there was no jurisdiction over the United States and no power to interfere with its pub- \n\n[246 U.S. 28, 44]\n\u00a0\n lic property or duties, it yet considered that there was jurisdiction to restrain the individual, although an officer, from continuing to take property without compensation in violation of the Constitution. A certiorari was granted. It was stipulated in the cause that the structures complained of had been made in all the arsenals of the United States by Crozier, the Chief of Ordinance, and by the United States, and that the United States had asserted the right, and proposed to continue, to make the guns and gun carriages in the future for its governmental purposes and denied the violation of any patent right. It was also stipulated that the Chief of Ordinance had made no profits and that all claims were waived except the claim of right to a permanent injunction at the termination of the suit to prevent the use of the appliances in the future. And that was the solitary issue which here arose for decision.\n It was held that in view of the admission as to the nature and character of the acts done by the United States and further in view of the power of the United States to take under eminent domain the patent rights asserted, the provisions of the statute affording a right of action and compensation were adequate to justify the exercise of such power. In accordance with this ruling it was decided that there was no right to an injunction against the Chief of Ordinance as an individual and the parties if their rights had been infringed were relegated to the compensation provided under the act of 1910. In reaching this conclusion the statute was critically considered principally for the purpose of determining whether the right to recover compensation which the act afforded was adequate to fulfill the requirements of compensation for rights taken as protected by the Constitution. It is true in the analysis which was made of the statute for this purpose it was said that the consummated result of the act of 1910 in any particular case was to confer upon the United States a license to use the patent right (page 305). \n\n[246 U.S. 28, 45]\n\u00a0\n But the use of the word 'license' affords no room for holding that it was decided that the statute provided for the appropriation by anticipation and automatically of a license to the United States to u e the rights of all patentees as to every patent. And clearer yet is it that the use of the word 'license' affords no ground for the proposition that the statute invested every person contracting with the United States for the furnishing of material or supplies or for doing works of construction with public powers and transferred to them the assumed license to violate patent rights to the end that they might be relieved of the obligations of their contracts and entail upon the United States unenumerated and undetermined responsibility upon the assumption that the United States would be ultimately liable for the patent rights which the contractors might elect to take. Through abundance of precaution, however, we say that if any support for such contentions be susceptible of being deduced from the use of the word 'license' in the passage referred to, then the word must be and it is limited, as pointed out by the context of the opinion and by what we have said in this case, to the nature and character of use which was contemplated by the statute and which is consonant with the execution of its limited though beneficent purpose and not destructive of the same.\n Under the view which we have stated it follows that the court below did not err in ordering the accounting under the 1911 contracts to proceed so that the statute when correctly construed might be applied. To the end, therefore, that effect may be given to such accounting as ordered by the court below our decree will be\n The order of the Circuit Court of Appeals to the extent that it directed the accounting to be made on the basis therein stated is affirmed and the decree of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] International Curtis Marine Turbine Co. v.

Whether the tax constitutes an unconstitutional restraint or burden on interstate commerce is the matter for decision.\n The company is an Illinois corporation and operates plants in Iowa, Missouri and Kansas for slaughtering live stock and converting the same into fresh meats and other articles of commerce. It sells the products throughout the United States, maintains branch houses in several states, including three in Minnesota, and owns a line of refrigerator cars wherein the products are shipped to the branch houses and places of consumption. Under a contractual arrangement it supplies these cars to the railroads for use in such transportation and receives therefor a fixed compensation per mile of travel. In the territory embracing Minnesota this compensation or rental is one cent per mile whetehr the cars be loaded or empty. Usually the cars are moved to particular destinations with loads of the company's products and are returned empty to be loaded again, but where it is practicable to do so the railroads are free to carry other freight in them on the \n\n[246 U.S. 450, 452]\n\u00a0\n return trip. The company pays the usual tariff rates for the transportation of its products, just as though the railroads owned the cars, and also bears the expense of all repairs save such as become necessary through negligent handling by the railroads. The use made of the cars in Minnesota consists in transporting the company's products (a) across the state from points without on one side to points without on another, (b) from points without to points within the state and the reverse, and (c) between points within the state. Of their total mileage in the state 90 per cent. is in interstate and 10 per cent. in intrastate transportation. The average number of cars in the state per day ranges from 10 to 12.\n The cash value of each car, as a separate article of tangible property, is from $700 to $900, and the intangible property incident to their combined use under the contractual arrangement with the railroads is also, as the record shows, of substantial value. The tax in question is all that is assessed against the company in respect of the cars or the intangible property. It has other tangible property in the state, not pa t of its car line, whereon it pays the usual local taxes.\n The receipts of the railroads from shipments carried in these cars in Minnesota, less the compensation or rental paid to the company, are added to the other gross earnings of the railroads from business in the state and the total is taken as the value for purposes of taxation of the property which the railroads own or operate in the state for railway purposes.\n As construed and applied by the state court, the Minnesota law requires a freight line company, meaning a company furnishing or leasing cars to railroads for freight transportation, to report annually its gross earnings from the operation of its car line within the state and to pay, in lieu of other taxes on the property so employed, a tax fixed at a stated per cent. of such earnings. That court \n\n[246 U.S. 450, 453]\n\u00a0\n holds that this law is an exertion of the power of the state to tax the property within its limits from which the earnings are derived and is intended to embody a practical method of reaching and valuing that property, tangible and intangible, for taxing purposes.\n In so far as the property constituting this car line is regularly or habitually used or employed in Minnesota it is within the taxing power of the state, although chiefly devoted or applied to interstate transportation. Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 U.S. 18\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 876; Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, \n165 U.S. 194\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 305; Id., \n166 U.S. 185\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 604; American Refrigerator Co. v. Hall, \n174 U.S. 70\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 599; Union Refrigerator Co. v. Lynch, \n177 U.S. 149\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 631. This is not questioned; but it is insisted that the tax imposed is not a property tax but one laid directly on the gross earnings. Of course, if it is laid on the earnings as such, they being derived largely from interstate commerce, it is an unconstitutional restraint or burden on such commerce and void. Fargo v. Michigan, \n121 U.S. 230\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 857; Philadelphia & Southern Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 U.S. 326\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 1118; Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n210 U.S. 217\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 638. On the other hand, if what is done is to reach the property and not to tax the gross earnings, the latter being taken merely as an index or measure of the value of the former, it well may be that the objection urged against the tax is untenable; for, as this court has said, 'by whatever name the tax or taxes may be called that are fixed by reference to the value of the property, if they are not imposed because of its use in interstate or foreign commerce, and if they amount to no more than would be legitimate as an ordinary tax upon the property, valued with reference to the use in which it is employed, they are not open to attack' as restraining or burdening such commerce. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 367\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99; Postal Telegraph Co. v. Adams, \n155 U.S. 688\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 268, 360; Wisconsin & Michigan Ry. Co. v. Powers, 191 \n\n[246 U.S. 450, 454]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 379, 387, 24 Sup. Ct. 107; Fargo v. Hart, \n193 \nU.S. 490, 499\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 498; Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas, supra.\n As before stated, the state court regards the tax as imposed in respect of the property rather than the earnings, and the same view seems to be taken by the Legislature, for the Act of 1909 speaks of the tax as 'a tax upon its [the company's] property' and the Act of 1911 says 'the value of such property [that used within the state] for purpose of taxation is to be determined' by reference to the gross earnings from the mileage within the state. True, this local view is not conclusive on this court, but it cannot be rejected unless it can be said to be ill founded.\n The question of the nature and effect of taxes more or less like this has been repeatedly considered in t is court. In some instances its solution has been attended with considerable difficulty, for while the controlling general principles have long been well settled it has not been easy to apply to all the varying situations presented. A short reference to two recent cases in which the earlier decisions were reviewed will leave little to be said in solving the question here. We refer to Meyer v. Wells Fargo & Co., \n223 U.S. 298\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 218, and United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 U.S. 335\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 211, both decided on the same day. The former involved a tax in Oklahoma of a stated per cent. of the gross receipts of an express company doing both a local and an interstate business in that state. The statute ( Laws Okl. 1910, c. 44,  2) called the tax a 'gross revenue tax' and declared that it was to be 'in addition to the taxes levied and collected upon an ad valorem basis upon the property and assets' of the company. We held that the tax could not be sustained as a tax on the gross earnings, they being partly derived from interstate commerce, and also held that it could not be regarded as a property tax, because, as the statute disclosed, all the property of the company in the state was to be reached and valued in another way. The other case involved a tax in Minnesota of a desig- \n\n[246 U.S. 450, 455]\n\u00a0\n nated per cent. of the gross earnings of an express company from business done in that state, the business being partly local and partly interstate commerce. The statute declared that the tax was to be in lieu of other taxes on the company's property, and the state court held that it was not in reality a tax on the gross earnings, but was a tax on the property, the earnings being taken merely as a measure of the value of the property for taxing purposes. We accepted and gave effect to that holding, not as being conclusive on us, but on the grounds that the property from which the earnings were derived was not to be otherwise taxed, that the tax was part of a system intended to reach the full value of the company's property in the state as reflected by the gross earnings, and that the amount of the tax did not appear to be in excess of what would be legitimate as an ordinary tax on the property, valued with reference to its use as part of a going concern. The case dealing with the Oklahoma tax was distinguished by pointing out that that tax could not be regarded as a property tax, because it was to be in addition to another tax reaching the full value of the company's property in the state.\n The law imposing the present tax is closely patterned after the one exacting the tax upheld in United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, and contains the same declaration that the tax shall be in lieu of other taxes on the property. The statutes differ only in minor details and are both parts of a general system which the state applies to railroads, telephone lines and the like. So, unless this tax be otherwise distinguishable, it must, under the decision in that case, be regarded as a property tax and not as laid on the gross earnings.\n Because the usual tax rate, if applied to the cash value of the cars taken separately, would result in an appreciably lower tax, it is insisted that the tax imposed is in excess of what would be legitimate as an ordinary tax \n\n[246 U.S. 450, 456]\n\u00a0\n on the property. But the contention proceeds on an erroneous assumption. The state is not confined to taxing the cars or to taxing them as separate articles. It may tax the entire property, tangible and intangible, constituting the car line as used within its limits, and may tax the same at its real value as part of a going concern. The record makes it reasonably certain that the property, valued with reference to its use and what it earns, is worth considerably more than the cash value of the cars taken separately-enough more to indicate that the tax is not in excess of what would be legitimate as an ordinary tax on the property taken at its real or full value.\n Because the receipts of he railroads from shipments in these cars, less the rental paid to the company, are made a factor in valuing for taxation the property on which the railroads are taxed, it is contended that the cars are taxed twice, once to the company and again to the railroads, and are excessively valued. The contention apparently assumes that the receipts from such shipments arise solely from the use of these cars, whereas they arise in part from the use of the tracks, locomotives, fuel, labor and the like provided by the railroads. Not improbably only a monor part is fairly attributable to the use of cars. In any event, the company has an interest in the car line which yields it a rental of one cent for each mile of travel. This interest is taxable and the state values it for that purpose by the rental received. In valuing the property on which the railroads are taxed the amount of the rental is deducted from their earnings. This plainly discloses a purpose to avoid taxing the same property twice or at more than its value, measured by what it earns.\n We think the tax is not distinguishable from that sustained in United States Express Co. v. Minnesota.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDALTON ADDING MACH CO. v. COM.

It will suffice briefly to state and indicate our opinion in respect of the federal questions as raised in No. 147.\n The following portions of Remington & Ballinger's Ann. Codes & Stats. of Washington are in force as law in that state:\n'Sec. 811. Every person is guilty of a forcible detainer who either,--\n\n'1. By force, or menaces and threats of violence, unlawfully holds and keeps the possession of any real property, whether the same was acquired peaceably or otherwise; or\n\n'2. Who in the nighttime, or during the absence of the occupant of any real property [unlawfully] enters thereon, and who, after demand made for the surrender thereof, refuses for the period of three days to surrender the same to such former occupant. The occupant of real property within the meaning of this subdivision is one who, for the five days next preceding such unlawful entry, was in the peaceable and undisturbed possession of such real property.'\n\n'Sec. 825. On the trial of any proceeding for any forcible entry or forcible detainer, the plaintiff shall only be required to show, in addition to a forcible entry complained of, that he was peaceably in the actual possession at the time of the forcible entry; or in addition to a forcible detainer complained of, that he w  entitled to the possession at the time of the forcible detainer.'\n\n Relying upon these sections, defendant in error instituted an action of forcible detainer in the superior court for Spokane county, alleging that while he was (and for more than five days had been) in peaceful and undisturbed possession of certain lands inclosed by a good and substantial fence plaintiff in error in the nighttime 'broke the inclosure above mentioned around said above-described premises and entered thereon, and has since said \n\n[246 U.S. 208, 212]\n\u00a0\n entry continuously occupied and remained upon said premises,' and has refused to surrender them. He asked restitution and damages.\n By answer and also by tender of proof plaintiff in error unsuccessfully sought to set up and show that the lands belonged to the United States (having never been granted) were unlawfully inclosed and that he entered in order to initiate a homestead claim. The Supreme Court affirmed a judgment granting relief asked by defendant in error. 85 Wash. 322, 325, 326, 327, 328, 148 Pac. 15, 16. It found that for more than 20 years he had been in peaceful possession of the lands which were fenced and under cultivation, and that at night plaintiff in error broke the inclosure, entered, and refused to remove.\n After quoting the two sections set out above, the court said:\n'These statutes are clearly peace statutes, and the issues in a case of this kind are but two: First. Was the plaintiff, for five days prior to the entry of the defendant, in the peaceable and actual possession of the land? and, second, Was the entry of the defendant a forcible entry and an unlawful detainer? The statute makes no provision for the trial of title or the right of possession in such a case. Other remedies are afforded by other statutes to try title or right of possession. This statute does not contemplate that a person, even though he be entitled to possession, may, by force or stealth, obtain possession, and thereby put upon the plaintiff the burden of proving the paramount title or a paramount right of possession.'\n\n Replying to insistence that the premises were unappropriated public lands which a qualified citizen might rightfully enter upon and improve under laws of the United States (R. S.  2289 et seq. [Comp. St. 1916,  4530 et seq.]) and the state statutes concerning unlawful or forcible detainer interfered therewith, the court declared:\n'It is clear, we think, that there is no conflict between the state statutes \n\n[246 U.S. 208, 213]\n\u00a0\n and the United States statutes. The United States statutes have made no provision for determining conflicting rights under claim of possession, but the determination of these rights is left to the states to be regulated by state statutes. ... Gauthier v. Morrison, \n232 U.S. 452\n, 461 [34 Sup. Ct. 384]. ... The question in this case was whether the respondent was in the peaceable and quiet possession of the real estate at the time of the forcible entry and unlawful detainer. If he was in the peaceable and quiet possession, then it follows, of course, that the appellant could not, by force or by unlawful entry in the nighttime, dispossess him of that peaceable possession. As stated above, neither could the question of title, or the paramount right of possession, be determined in this action. There is clearly no conflict between the federal and the state laws upon this question.'\n\n This answer, we think, is sufficient, and nothing need be added.\n To the further claim that the premises were fenced contrary to Act Feb. 25, 1885, c. 149, 23 Stat. 321, 322, and consequently plaintiff in error could properly break inclosure and enter in order to initiate a homestead claim, the court replied:\n'It is plain that the legal right of the parties to the possession of these lands cannot be tried in this action. But if the same could be tried, the appellant did not seek to show, either that the respondent was in possession of this particular tract of land without claim of right or color of title, or in bad faith, for it was apparen ly conceded that the respondent, or his tenant, was in actual possession of the tract of land in dispute, and that the respondent had purchased the land at a fair price and was in possession thereof claiming to be the owner. ... Cameron v. United States, \n148 U.S. 301\n, 305 [13 Sup. Ct. 595]. ... Even though the respondent had inclosed the land claimed to have been inclosed, such inclosure was not necessarily unlawful, because the inclosure is not prohibited where it is under claim of right or color of title. The record in this \n\n[246 U.S. 208, 214]\n\u00a0\n this case conclusively shows that the respondent was holding the land, which was surrounded by fence, under claim of right and color of title, and he and his predecessors had so held it for more than 20 years.'\n\n This reply we also think is correct and adequate.\n In Lyle v. Patterson, \n228 \nU.S. 211, 215\n, 216 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 480, 482 ( 57 L. Ed. 804), we held a possessory title may be good as against all except the United States and pointed out the evil consequences which would 'result if possession secured by violence and maintained with force and arms could furnish the basis of a right enforceable in law.'\n There is no error in either of the judgments below in respect of any federal question and both are\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDETROIT & M R. CO. v. FLETCHER PAPER CO.(1918)\nNo. 336\nArgued: Decided: November 18, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 30, 31]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James McNamara and Fred A. Baker, both of Detroit, Mich., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Edward S. Clark, of Bay City, Mich., and Irwin S. Canfield, of Alpena, Mich., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These five suits were actions of assumpsit brought to recover the difference between the rates fixed by the Michigan Railroad Commission on logs carried wholly within the State, from points on the defendant's (the plaintiff in error's) road to Alpena, and the higher rates that the defendant actually charged. The plaintiffs got judgments which were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Michigan, 164 N. W. 528, and the cases are brought here upon lengthy assignments of error. The plaintiffs now move to dismiss or affirm. We are of opinion that the judgments should be affirmed.\n Most of the assignments of error concern questions of local law with which we cannot deal. Such are whether the order of the Commission were in force pending an injunction and before the defendant railroad had fixed rates in pursuance of a mandate of the State Court; whether the State laws permit an action to be maintained without an order of reparation by the Commission; and whether the statutes purport to make the order fixing the rates conclusive in the present suits. These questions depend upon the construction of the State laws, as to which, upon writs of error to the State Court that Court has the last word. Its power would not be diminished if similar provisions in an Act of Congress had been differently construed by this Court. The only question properly before us is whether the statutes as construed run against the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. It is argued that they do, if, \n\n[248 U.S. 30, 32]\n\u00a0\n as was held, they preclude an inquiry in these proceedings into the confiscatory character of the rates in present circumstances. But the defendant had had its chance to have the validity of the rates judicially determined in a suit for that purpose and had used it. Detroit & Mackinac Ry. Co. v. Michigan Railroad Commission, \n235 U.S. 402\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 126. There is nothing to hinder a State from providing that after a judicial inquiry into the validity of such an order it shall be binding upon the parties until changed. The defendant was free to apply to the Commission.\n A milling-in-transit rate allowing the defendant to add fifty cents a thousand feet on lumber if, instead of being carried on, after it was manufactured, on the through rate, the product was not reshipped by the defendant's line, was held to be permitted by the statute. It is said that this would be contrary to the interstate commerce act if these cases involved interstate commerce, which they do not. We see no question concerning it that requires to be dealt with here.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDICKINSON v. STILES(1918)\nNo. 735\nArgued: Decided: April 29, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Edward S. Stringer, of St. Paul, Minn., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. George H. Lamar, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error to correct a judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota which sustained the validity of a statute of the State held applicable to this case and alleged by the plaintiff in error to be repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States when so applied. The facts that raise the question are simple. One Holloway sued the plaintiff in error under the Employers' Liability Act for personal injuries and engaged the de- \n\n[246 U.S. 631, 632]\n\u00a0\n fendant in error, Stiles, as his attorney, agreeing to pay him one-third of the amount recovered by suit or settlement. The statutes of Minnesota give the attorney a lien upon the cause of action. Gen. Stats. of 1913,  4955. Before trial the plaintiff in error settled by paying $6,500. Stiles intervened in the cause and claimed his fee pursuant to his contract. There was a trial which ended in a judgment for Stiles-the trial court ruling that the Minnesota statute was effective to impose a lien upon a cause of action arising under the Act of Congress relating to the liability of carriers by railroad to their employes. April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65. April 5, 1910, c. 143, 36 Stat. 291. The Supreme Court of the State sustained this ruling, 137 Minn. 410, 163 N. W. 791, and subsequently, without further discussion, affirmed the judgment for Stiles.\n It is argued for the defendant in error that it does not appear sufficiently in the record that the case turned upon the ruling supposed. But the original declaration was for an injury alleged to have been received in interstate commerce and, whatever the answer denied, that was the claim that was settled. The question was called to the attention of the trial court and was discussed at length by the Supreme Court. We perceive no ground for the motion to dismiss.\n Coming to the merits, cases that declare that the acts of Congress supersede all state legislation on the subject of the liability of railroad companies to their employes have nothing to do with the matter. The Minnesota statute does not meddle with that. It affects neither the amount recovered nor the persons by whom it is recovered, nor again the principles of distribution. It deals only with a necessary expense of recovery. Congress cannot have contemplated that the claims to which its action gave rise or power would be paid in all cases without litigation, or that suits would be tried by lawyers for nothing, yet \n\n[246 U.S. 631, 633]\n\u00a0\n it did not regulate attorney's fees. It contemplated suits in state courts and accepted state procedure in advance. Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Bombolis, \n241 U.S. 211\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 595, L. R. A. 1917A, 86, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 505; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Stewart, \n241 U.S. 261\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 586. We see no reason why it should be supposed to have excluded ordinary incidents of state procedure. Before the Carmack Amendment it was held not to invalidate state legislation requiring, under a penalty, prompt settlement of claims for loss of freight in the State, Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Mazursky, \n216 U.S. 122\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 378; see Charleston & Western Carolina Ry. Co. v. Varnville Furniture Co., \n237 U.S. 597\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 715, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 333; or, since that amendment, allowing in the costs a moderate attorney's fee, for small claims unsuccessfully disputed, Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Harris, \n234 U.S. 412\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 790, L. R. A. 1915E, 942, although both laws affect commerce among the States. \n The statutes referred to in the last cited cases imposed liability for an additional sum. The present one does not. We presume that it would not be contended that the Employers' Liability Act prevented the assignment of a judgment under it in such form as was allowed by the law of Minnesota, or that it allowed the defendant to disregard such an assignment after notice. Nor do we perceive any different rule for an assignment of judgment or cause of action by way of security, which under the Minnesota statute the contract with Holloway brought to pass. It is true that this security is made effectual by requiring payment to the attorney, Davis v. Great Northern Ry. Co., 128 Minn. 354, 358, 151 N. W. 128, and this may be said to result in requiring the judgment debtor to split up the payment. But surely there is nothing in that liability, seemingly common to all Minnesota judgments, Wheaton v. Spooner, 52 Minn. 417, 423, 54 N. W. 372, that introduces an interference with the Act of Congress that otherwise would not exist. In cases where a partial assignment is provided for irrespective of attorneys' fees we \n\n[246 U.S. 631, 634]\n\u00a0\n should not expect to hear the suggestion of such a point. The whole case is simply that the State allows the attorney employed to collect a claim to be subrogated to the rights of the claimant so far as to secure the attorney's fees. We see no reason why it should not.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDILLON v.

Is section 4530 of the Revised Statutes of the \n\n[248 U.S. 182, 184]\n\u00a0\n United States, as the same was amended by the last-mentioned act of Congress approved March 4, 1915, violative of the Constitution of the United States in so far as it provides:\n'That this section shall apply to seamen on foreign vessels while in harbors of the United States, and the courts of the United States shall be open to such seamen for its enforcement.'\n\n The certificate is made under section 239 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [Comp. St. 1916,  1216]), which makes provision for the certification of questions of law to this court from a Circuit Court of Appeals. The section provides that this court may give instruction on the questions certified, or it may order the whole record sent up for consideration and decision. Rule 37 of this court (32 Sup. Ct. xiv) provides that in such cases the certificate shall contain a proper statement of the facts on which the questions of law arise. The certificate in this case fails to comply with this rule of court. It contains a partial statement of Dillon's contract with the ship. It states that no part of the sum sued for was due under the shipping articles signed by Dillon. It does not state the terms of payment agreed upon, when or where payments were to be made under the contract, or what advancements, if any, were to be made during the voyage. The certificate concludes:\n'For information as to the facts of the case copies of the transcripts and briefs are herewith transmitted.'\n\n Counsel argue the case by reference to the transcript of the record in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and it is apparent that a proper consideration of the case requires such reference. This transcript is no part of our record. This court alone has authority to have it sent up. The briefs in the Circuit Court of Appeals are no part of the record here. The certificate is required to state the pertinent facts in order that this court may answer the questions of law certified with reference to such facts, and not by searching the records and briefs of the Circuit Court of Appeals itself.\n The certificate therefore fails to comply with our rule, \n\n[248 U.S. 182, 185]\n\u00a0\n and in accordance with the established practice must be dismissed.

MITCHELL BROS. CO.(1918)\nNo. 492\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 179, 180]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Mark Norris and Oscar E. Waer, both of Grand Rapids, Mich., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action to recover from the Collector additional taxes assessed against the respondent under the Corporation Excise Tax Act of August 5, 1909 (chapter 6, 36 Stat. 11, 112,  38), and paid under protest. The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiff, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (225 Fed. 437; 235 Fed. 686, 149 C. C. A. 106, L. R. A. 1917E, 568), and the case comes here on certiorari.\n It was submitted at the same time with several other cases decided this day, arising under the same act. \n\n[247 U.S. 179, 181]\n\u00a0\n The facts are as follows: Plaintiff is a lumber manufacturing corporation which operates its own mills, manufactures into lumber therein its own stumpage, sells the lumber in the market, and from these sales and sales of various by-products makes its profits, declares its dividends, and creates its surplus. It sells its stumpage lands, so-called, after the timber is cut and removed. Its sole business is as described; it is not a real estate trading corporation. Plaintiff acquired certain timber lands at its organization in 1903 and paid for them at a valuation approximately equivalent to $20 per acre. Owing to increases in the market price of stumpage the market value of the timber land, on December 31, 1908, had become approximately $40 per acre. \n1\n The company made no entry upon its books representing this increase, but each year entered as a profit the difference between the original cost of the timber cut and the sums received for the manufactured product, less the cost of manufacture. After the passage of the Excise Tax Act, and preparatory to making a return of income for the year 1909, the company revalued its timber stumpage as of December 31, 1908, at approximately $40 per acre. The good faith and accuracy of this valuation are not in question, but the figures representing it never were entered in the corporate books.\n Under the act the company made a return for each of the years 1909, 1910, 1911, and 1912, and in each instance deducted from its gross receipts the market value, as of December 31, 1908, of the stumpage cut and converted during the year covered by the tax. There appears to have been no change in its market value during these years.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue having al- \n\n[247 U.S. 179, 182]\n\u00a0\n lowed a deduction of the cost of the timber in 1903 and refused to allow the difference between that cost and the fair market value of the timber on December 31, 1908, the question is whether this difference (made the basis of the additional taxes) was income for the years in which it was converted into money, within the meaning of the act.\n Other items are involved in the case, arising from the sale of certain stump lands, certain by-products, and a parcel of real extate, but they raise no different question from that which arises upon the valuation of the stumpage, and need not be further mentioned.\n The act became effective January 1, 1909, and provided for the annual payment by every domestic corporation 'organized for profit and having a capital stock represented by shares' of an excise tax 'equivalent to one per centum upon the entire net income over and above five thousand dollars received by it from all sources during such year,' with exceptions not now material. It declared that such net income should be ascertained by deducting from the gross income received within the year from all sources the expenses paid within the year out of income in the maintenance and operation of business and property, including rentals and the like; losses sustained within the year and not compensated by insurance or otherwise, including a reasonable allowance for depreciation of property; interest paid within the year to a limited extent; taxes; and amounts received within the year as dividends upon stock of other corporations subject to the same tax. In the case of a corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country, the net income was to be ascertained by taking into account the gross income received within the year 'from business transacted and capital invested within the United States and any of its territories, Alaska, and the District of Columbia,' with deductions for expenses of maintenance and operation, \n\n[247 U.S. 179, 183]\n\u00a0\n business losses, interest, and taxes, all referable to that portion of its business transacted and capital invested within the United States, etc.\n An examination of these and other provisions of the act makes it plain that the legislative purpose was not to tax property as such, or the mere conversion of property, but to tax the conduct of the business of corporations organized for profit by a measure based upon the gainful returns from their business operations and property from the time the act took effect. As was pointed out in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 145\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 342, 347 (55 L. Ed. 389, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312) the tax was imposed 'not upon the franchises of the corporation irrespective of their use in business, nor upon the proper y of the corporation, but upon the doing of corporate or insurance business and with respect to the carrying on thereof'; an exposition that has been consistently adhered to. McCoach v. Minehill R. R. Co., \n228 \nU.S. 295, 300\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 419; United States v. Whitridge, \n231 \nU.S. 144, 147\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 24; Anderson v. Forty-Two Broadway, \n239 \nU.S. 69, 72\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 17.\n When we come to apply the act to gains acquired through an increase in the value of capital assets acquired before and converted into money after the taking effect of the act, questions of difficulty are encountered. The suggestion that the entire proceeds of the conversion should be still treated as the same capital, changed only in form and containing no element of income although including an increment of value, we reject at once as inconsistent with the general purpose of the act. Selling for profit is too familiar a business transaction to permit us to suppose that it was intended to be omitted from consideration in an act for taxing the doing of business in corporate form upon the basis of the income received 'from all sources.'\n Starting from this point, the learned Solicitor General has submitted an elaborate argument in behalf of the \n\n[247 U.S. 179, 184]\n\u00a0\n government, based in part upon theoretical definitions of 'capital,' 'income,' 'profits,' etc., and in part upon expressions quoted from our opinions in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 147\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312, and Anderson v. Forty-Two Broadway, \n239 \nU.S. 69, 72\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 17, with the object of showing that a conversion of capital into money always produces income, and that for the purposes of the present case the words 'gross income' are equivalent to 'gross receipts'; the insistence being that the entire proceeds of a conversion of capital assets should be treated as gross income, and that by deducting the mere cost of such assets we arrive at net income. The cases referred to throw little light upon the present matter, and the expressions quoted from the opinions were employed by us with reference to questions wholly remote from any that is here presented.\n The formula that the entire receipts derived from a conversion of capital assets after deducting cost value must be treated as net income, so far as it is applied to a conversion of assets acquired before the act took effect and so as to tax as income any increased value that accrued before that date, finds no support in either the letter or the spirit of the act, and brings the former into incongruity with the latter. If the gross receipts upon such a conversion are to be treated as gross income, what authority have we for deducting either the cost or the previous market value of the assets converted in order to arrive at net income? The deductions specifically authorized are only such as expenses of maintenance and operation of the business and property, rentals, uncompensated losses, depreciation, interest, and taxes. There is no express provision that even allows a merchant to deduct the cost of the goods that he sells.\n Yet it is plain, we think, that by the true intent and meaning of the act the entire proceeds of a mere conversion of capital assets were not to be treated as income. \n\n[247 U.S. 179, 185]\n\u00a0\n Whatever difficulty there may be about a precise and scientific definition of 'income,' it imports, as used here, something entirely distinct from principal or capital either as a subject of taxation or as a measure of the tax; conveying rather the idea of gain or increase arising from corporate activities. As was said in Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 399, 415\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 136: 'Income may be defined as the gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined.'\n Understanding the term in this natural and obvious sense, it cannot be said that a conversion of capital assets invariably produces income. If sold at less than cost, it produces rather loss or outgo. Nevertheless, in many if not in most cases there results a gain that properly may be accounted as a part of the 'gross income' received 'from all sources'; and by applying to this the authorized deductions we arrive at 'net income.' In order to determine whether there has been gain or loss, and the amount of the gain if any, we must withdraw from the gross proceeds an amount sufficient to restore the capital value that existed at the commencement of the period under consideration.\n This has been recognized from the beginning by the administrative officers of the government. Shortly after the passage of the act, and before the time (March 1, 1910) for making the first returns of income, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, promulgated Regulations No. 31, under date December 3, 1909, for the guidance of collectors and other subordinate officers in the performance of their duties under the act. These prescribed, with respect to manufacturing companies, that gross income should consist of the difference between the price received for the goods as sold and the cost of such goods as manufactured; cost to be 'ascertained by an addition of a charge to the account of goods as \n\n[247 U.S. 179, 186]\n\u00a0\n manufactured during the year of the sum of the inventory at beginning of the year and a credit to the account of the sum of the inventory at the end of the year.' In the case of mercantile companies, gross income was to be the 'amount ascertained through inventory, or its equivalent, which shows the difference between the price received for goods sold and the cost of goods purchased during the year, with an addition of a charge to the account of the sum of the inventory at beginning of the year and a credit to the account of the sum of the inventory at the end of the year.' And as to miscellaneous corporations, gross income was to be 'the gross revenue derived from the operation and management of the business and property of the corporation,' with all income derived from other sources. The matter of income arising from a profitable sale of capital assets was dealt with specifically in such a way as to limit the tax to income arising after the effective date of the act. This was done by adopting the rule that an advance in value arising during a period of years should be so adjusted that only so much as properly was attributable to the time subsequent to January 1, 1909 (December 31, 1908, would have been more precise), should be subjected to the tax. \n2\n Subsequent treasury regulations, promulgated from time to time (T. D. 1606), March 29, 1910, \n\n[247 U.S. 179, 187]\n\u00a0\n paragraphs 40, 71, 76; T. D. 1675, February 14, 1911, paragraphs 37, 55, 75; T. D. 1742, December 15, 1911, paragraphs 43, 62, 86, 91), adhered to the same rule with respect to lands bought prior to January 1, 1909, and sold during a subsequent year, prescribing, however, that the profits, when not otherwise accurately determinable, should be prorated according to the time elapsed before and after the act took effect; and gave to it an application especially pertinent here, one of the regulations reading:\n'The mere removal of timber by cutting from timber lands, unless the timber is otherwise disposed of through sales or plant operations, is considered simply a change in form of assets. If said timber is disposed of through sales or otherwise, it is to be accounted for in accordance with regulations governing disposition of capital and other assets.'\n\n In our opinion these regulations correctly interpret the act in its application to the facts of the present case. When the act took effect, plaintiff's timber lands, with whatever value they then possessed, were a part of its capital assets, and a subsequent change of form by conversion into money did not change the essence. Their increased value since purchase, as that value stood on December 31, 1908, was not in any proper sense the result of the operation and management of the business or property of the corporation while the act as in force. Nor is the result altered by the mere fact that the increment of value had not been entered upon plaintiff's books of account. Such books are no more than evidential, being neither indispensable nor conclusive. The decision must rest upon the actual facts, which in the present case are not in dispute.\n The plaintiff, in making up its income tax returns for the years 1909, 1910, 1911, and 1912, deducted from its gross receipts the admittedly accurate valuation as of December 31, 1908, of the stumpage cut and converted DURING \n\n[247 U.S. 179, 188]\n\u00a0\n THE YEAR COVERED BY THE TAX. THERe having been no change in market values during these years, the deduction did but restore to the capital in money that which had been withdrawn in stumpage cut, leaving the aggregate of capital neither increased nor decreased, and leaving the residue of the gross receipts to represent the gain realized by the conversion, so far as that gain arose while the act was in effect. This was in accordance with the true intent and meaning of the act.\n It may be observed that it is a mere question of methods, not affecting the result, whether the amount necessary to be withdrawn in order to preserve capital intact should be deducted from gross receipts in the process of ascertaining gross income, or should be deducted from gross income in the form of a depreciation account in the process of determining net inome. In either case the object is to distinguish capital previously existing from income taxable under the act.\n There is only a superficial analogy between this case and the case of an allowance claimed for depreciation of a mining property through the removal of minerals, since we have held that owing to the peculiar nature of mining property its partial exhaustion attributable to the removal of ores cannot be regarded as depreciation within the meaning of the act. Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., \n242 \nU.S. 503, 520\n, 524 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 201; United States v. Biwabik Mining Co., \n247 U.S. 116\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 462, 62 L. Ed. --, this day decided; Goldfield Consolidated Mines Co. v. Scott, \n247 U.S. 126\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 465, 62 L. Ed. --, this day decided.\n It should be added that in this case no question is raised as to whether, in apportioning the profits derived from a disposition of capital assets acquired before and converted after the act took effect, the division should be pro rata, according to the time elapsed, or should be based upon an inventory taken as of December 31, 1908. Plaintiffs, in accordance with Treasury Regulations No. 31, T. D. 1578, January 4, 1910, and T. D. 1588, January \n\n[247 U.S. 179, 189]\n\u00a0\n 24, 1910, adopted the latter method, and the government makes no contention as to the accuracy of the result thereby reached, under the stipulated facts, if our construction of the act be correct.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The valuations were based upon the quantity of standing timber, at certain prices per thousand feet for the different varieties. The approximate acreage equivalent is employed for convenience. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Extract from Treasury Regulations No. 31, issued December 3, 1909.\n Sale of Capital Assets.-In ascertaining income derived from the sale of capital assets, if the assets were acquired subsequent to January 1, 1909, the difference between the selling price and the buying price shall constitute an item of gross income to be added to or subtracted from gross income according to whether the selling price was greater or less than the buying price. If the capital assets were acquired prior to January 1, 1909, the amount of increment or depreciation representing the difference between the selling and buying price is to be adjusted so as to fairly determine the proportion of the loss or gain arising subsequent to January 1, 1909, and which proportion shall be deducted from or added to the gross income for the year in which the sale was made. \n\n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nE H EMERY & CO. v. AMERICAN REFRIGERATOR TRANSIT CO(1918)\nNo. 739\nArgued: Decided: April 29, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. C. W. Whitmore, of Ottumwa, Iowa, for appellant.\n Mr. Fred. W. Lehmann, Jr., of Des Moines, Iowa, for appellee. \n\n[240 U.S. 634, 635]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff, the appellant, brought a suit in a State Court against the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company and the appellee. The original petition sought to charge both, as common carriers, under the Interstate Commerce Acts for damage to peaches caused by their being improperly stowed, handled and iced, amounting to less than $3,000. After a trial a judgment was entered for the railroad and it was held that under the Iowa Statutes the present appellee was entitled to be dismissed, as sued in the wrong county. Thereupon the plaintiff issued a garnshee process against the railroad as a debtor of the appellee, upon which the railroad made default. Then the appellee was dismissed 'as to the personal action but not as to said proceeding in rem,' and a time was allowed for the filing of a petition by the appellant. A petition calling itself 'Substituted Petition' was filed on October 16, 1916, and a few days later in the same month a petition for removal to the District Court of the United States was presented, which was gran ed by the State Court. A motion to remand was made and denied. The plaintiff stood upon its motion and declined to proceed farther, denying the jurisdiction of the Court, whereupon the petition was dismissed, judgment was entered for the defendant, an appeal was taken and it was certified that the appeal was taken solely upon the jurisdiction of the Court.\n We are content to assume without deciding that the case, whether a new action or not, had become removable if the difficulties to be mentioned can be overcome. On this assumption the jurisdiction is maintained on the argument that the plaintiff seeks to impose liability upon the defendant through the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, the governing tariffs and an interstate bill of \n\n[240 U.S. 634, 636]\n\u00a0\n lading issued by the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company of Texas. The amendment to the Judicial Code,  28, by the Act of January 20, 1914, c. 11, 38 Stat. 278, prohibiting the removal from state courts of suits, under section 20 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, against common carriers for injury to property, where the matter in controversy does not exceed $3, 000, is met by the fact that the substituted petition does not charge the defendant as a common carrier, and both parties now agree that it was not one. Hence, it is said, the suit can be removed irrespective of the amount involved. It becomes necessary therefore to inquire in what way the defendant is supposed to be liable under the Acts of Congress. The substituted petition relies upon a contract between the defendant and the Missouri, Kansas & Texas road by which the former assumed liability for the damages of the kind alleged, or some of them, and the fact that the railroad was a party to the bills of lading and the governing interstate tariffs, although the appellee was not. It also relies upon an alleged contract between it and the defendant for the cars involved and an implied undertaking for proper care and service. This last ground and other similar ones may be laid on one side as they clearly are outside the scope of the statutes concerned. So may a count alleging a partnership with the Missouri, Kansas & Texas in these transactions, as that would mean that the defendant became a common carrier pro hac vice and so within the above amendment to the Judicial Code.\n The chief if not the only way in which the Acts of Congress are brought in so as to give color to the attempt to remove is through the subjection of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas to those acts. But that affects the defendant only by virtue of a contract between it and road. If in some way unexplained a stranger to the contract is entitled to profit by it, the foundation is the contract, not the laws which fixed the liability of the railroad that the \n\n[240 U.S. 634, 637]\n\u00a0\n defendant assumed. The laws did not operate upon the defendant by their own force but merely as a measure of the damages agreed to be paid. To follow the language of a somewhat different case, the contract 'is the sole determinant of the conditions supposed, and its reference elsewhere for their fulfillment is like the reference to a document that it adopts and makes part of itself.' Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n237 \nU.S. 300, 303\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 598.\n One count alleges that the defendant caused the damage as agent for the Missouri, Kansas & Texas road by furnishing cars with insufficient tanks, employing inexperienced men and defectively stowing and failing to ice the peaches, and that these acts 'constituted misfeasance on the part of defendant of the duties it owed to its principal the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company of Texas, and to the public at large.' If this is not disposed of by what we have said, then it states no duty under the Act to Regulate Commerce, but only one at common law. In no aspect can it be maintained that any count attempts to allege a primary liability of the defendant under the Act to Regulate Commerce otherwise than as carrier and if sued as a carrie it cannot remove because the amount in controversy is too small.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nE W BLISS CO. v. U S(1918)\nNo. 15\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 37, 38]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George W. Field and Arthur C. Fraser, both of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. G. Carroll Todd, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 37, 39]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appeal from a decree of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals ( United States v. E. W. Bliss Co., 224 Fed. 325, 139 C. C. A. 633) amending and affirming a decree of the District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered in a suit brought by the United States against appellant ( herein referred to as the Bliss Company) restraining the latter from exhibiting or communicating the construction and operation of a torpedo known as the Bliss-Leavitt torpedo.\n The controversy turns upon the construction and application of certain clauses of the contracts between the Bliss Company and the United States and is not, we think, in broad compass. In support of its contention in the main the United States has the sanction of the two courts.\n The development, construction and operation of the torpedo gave animation and attraction to the argument, but it is enough to say that its method of propulsion is the balanced turbine method, so called, that is, turbines revolving in opposite directions. The United States asserts that to this method of propulsion the excellence and efficacy of the torpedo is due and that it was the conception of the United States; that it was the result of much experimentation on the part of its engineers and those of the Bliss Company and the expenditure of substantial sums of money by the government, and that because of the superior speed, range and power of this new weapon, other nations have been eager to learn the secrets of its construction.\n The Bliss Company denies these assertions, opposes them, besides, by the contentions that the balancing of rotary bodies analogous to turbines rotating in opposite directions was a matter of common knowledge long prior to any transactions with the United States and that the \n\n[248 U.S. 37, 40]\n\u00a0\n torpedoes constructed by it under its contract contained balanced turbines, so called, of its own design and property; or, to quote counsel:\n'The torpedo is the product of the assiduity and genius of the defendant's officers and engineers, and not that of the government.'\n\n And, further, that it purchased from Lieutenant Davison, with full knowledge of the United States, all of his rights to foreign patents, and to this patent, it is said, the United States assigns a special excellence. This is the issue in outline. The Bliss Company asserts the right to have other customers than the United States and to seek other markets, and not subject to restriction by the United States. The United States claims an exclusive service and even concealment from all others except as it may concede it. The resolution of the contentions is in the contract of the parties.\n Those transactions date to 1905 and are exhibited in three contracts, one of November 22, 1905, one of June 12, 1912, and an intervening one dated July 16, 1909. In the 1905 contract there was a provision, which it is admitted was embodied in all subsequent contracts. Disputes arose as to the meaning of the provision, the rights and restraints under it, and the Bliss Company brought them to litigation by expressing its desire to negotiate with Messrs. Whitehead & Company for the right to manufacture the torpedo in foreign countries. The Bureau of Ordnance objected, and on May 9, 1913, the company addressed the Secretary of Navy as follows:\n'As a means to this end we notify you hereby that it is our intention to communicate the complete construction and operation of the existing type of Bliss-Leavitt torpedo, and to make a demonstration of the operation of said torpedo, to a representative of Messrs. Whitehead & Company on or immediately after June 1, 1913.'\n\n To restrain the threatened action this suit was brought. The prayer of the bill covers the balanced turbine and \n\n[248 U.S. 37, 41]\n\u00a0\n certain other features, and it is manifest that whether it should be granted depends particularly upon a provision of the contract which prohibits the exhibition of the torpedo or its performance to any person whatsoever or to any other government, or its representatives, than that of the United States. That provision is that the Bliss Company 'will not make use of any device the design for which is furnished to it' by the United States 'in any torpedo constructed or to be constructed for any person or persons, firms, corporations, or others, or for other governments than' the United States and 'will not exhibit such device or in any way describe it to or give any information in regard to it to any person ... or to other governments, or their representatives' or exhibit its performance 'either in shop or in service tests.' A violation of the contract incurs its cancellation and releases the United States from all claims or demands under it. It is, however, provided that no design shall be considered as coming within the provisions unless the United States communicates in writing to the Bliss Company that it (the United States) thinks it is embraced by the provision. \n1\n It is disputed whether the condition of the pro vision \n\n[248 U.S. 37, 42]\n\u00a0\n was performed, but both the lower courts have found that it was, and we concur in their judgment. The condition of the provision, then, having been performed, we come to its meaning, the Bliss Company contending that the device must be of the invention of the United States, and the latter contending that it need only be 'furnished' by the United States.\n The Bliss Company's contention in its detail is somewhat difficult to state concisely. It rests as much in implication as in expression. It is said that the restrictive clause 'applies only to a 'device the design for which is furnished by the government\" and 'expressly and clearly excludes ideas, methods or principles.' And it is further urged that--\n'To furnish a design, it is necessary to furnish something concrete. A device is also something \n\n[248 U.S. 37, 43]\n\u00a0\n concrete. One cannot accept an idea.'\n\n To support these declarations legal and other definitions are adduced. One is selected from Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 U.S. 56\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 428, which explains a device to be 'a thing devised or formed by design, a contrivance, an invention.' It is hence asserted that the United States did not comply with these definitional requirements-indeed, from the state of the art, could not; and therefore could not impose secrecy upon the Bliss Company.\n The tangibility of the definitions and the arguments based upon them are not very clear nor what purpose they tend to establish. The company asserts a right to employ the principle of propulsion and this principle it asserts to be-to quote counsel-'the balancing of rotary bodies analogous to turbines rotating in opposite directions and of equal speeds for the purpose of eliminating gyroscopic effect,' and that it was 'long prior to 1906 [the first contract was made in 1905] a matter of common knowledge and known to the defendant' (the company); and again:\n'The balanced turbine principle was public property and not the property of the government. It was a matter of public knowledge and not a secret.'\n\n Therefore, as we have said, the contention is that it was not within the prohibition of the contracts. Immediately it may be asked: This being the condition, of what value was the restrictive clause to the government? Surely the government sought to secure something valuable and practical, and yet it was apparently only the promise of words never to have effective realization. Instead of security the government got a controversy. Anything it might offer or suggest or, to use the word of the contract, 'furnished,' would be open to dispute and the charge of being anticipated, already in existence among the things available to the company as 'public property and not the property of the government'-'a matter of public knowledge and not a secret.' And the govern ment \n\n[248 U.S. 37, 44]\n\u00a0\n could not even fortify itself by the presumptions of a patent. To have done so would have been to break the seal of secrecy and relieve the company from the obligations imposed by the contract. To this contention the Bliss Company is driven to get rid of the Davison patent, the design for which was furnished the company by the United States. Counsel say:\n'Assuming that the particular design of a balanced turbine produced by Davison was a secret, it lost every attribute of the secret upon the issuance by the United States government of letters patent to Davision.'\n\n And further:\n'The issuance of this patent, therefore, became an act of the Navy Department. Thus the government through the same department by which it entered into the several contracts with the defendant [the company ], caused the secret of the balanced turbine to be laid open to the public.'\n\n And, besides, it is said that the government 'tacitly permitted Davison, one of its officers and subject to its discipline, to assign' to the company 'foreign patents for the device in issue'; and that therefore 'it cannot now successfully contend that its design is within the restrictive clause.' But this gives an exaggerated effect of publicity to a patent and cannot dispense with the explicit obligation of the restrictive clause. Indeed, we may repeat, Of what avail was the restrictive clause to the government under the contentions of the company? It was assured of nothing but opposition and litigation. We may cite in further illustration of this that the Bliss Company asserts that the Davison device was without novelty in the field of 'opposite revolving turbines' (another name for a balanced turbine) and that all he did was to take a 'design of unbalanced turbine shown' in a prior patent 'and reverse one of the turbine wheels with the incidental and necessary change in the gearing.' The assertion is that 'the design of this gearing is what occupied Lieutenant Davison's time and thought.' We \n\n[248 U.S. 37, 45]\n\u00a0\n may say that we concur with the lower courts and think the patent is not so limited. The Bliss Company thought well enough of it to buy its foreign rights.\n The several contentions of the company are but fragments of the broader one that there were in the world's knowledge and available to the company practical devices as well as principles of operation which precluded a demand of secrecy by the government and which left the company free to use, or exhibit or sell to anybody torpedoes embodying them, the final and dominant contention being that the government's reservation was only of inventions, inventions, however, undisclosed, patentable but not patented. Yet the word of the contract is 'furnished,' not invented, and the words are of different significance. To invent means to create; to furnish means to supply. And the difference was too important, too pertinent to the purpose to have been overlooked-indeed, must have been deliberately contemplated to achieve the object of the parties. The government in its situation, considering the use of torpedoes and the uncertainty against whom to be used, would want to avail itself of the whole universe of things then existing or that might be brought into existence, in whatever way or combination it could. It is easy to believe that an arrangement of old devices might have value. And secrecy was an especial object, as far as it could be maintained and for such length of time as it could be maintained. The fact and the time might in instances be critical and determinative of a decisive result. The government considered the provision important to insert in the contract of 1905 and to repeat in every subsequent contract, to and including that of 1912, and to disregard the plea of the company for some relaxation of it to accommodate the company's interests. There was some relaxation in 1912 and 1913, but the confidential relation of the parties was emphasized as we have seen. \n\n[248 U.S. 37, 46]\n\u00a0\n This was the simple situation. It is free from the tangle and perplexities of the company's contentions. It gives use to the restrictive clause, directness of right and remedy, not dependent upon explorations into the prior art or the delays and termination of lawsuits. These observations apply to other parts of the torpedo as well as to the balanced turbine. The remarks of the Circuit Court of Appeals are pertinent. The court said:\n'Throughout the entire record, in the contracts, correspondence and dealings of the parties, the importance of secrecy is everywhere manifest. The nature of the services rendered was such that secrecy might almost be implied. It is difficult to imagine a nation giving to one of its citizens contracts to manufacture implements necessary to the national defense and permitting that citizen to disclose the construction of such implement or sell it to another nation. The very nature of the service makes the construction urged by the defendant untenable. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the injunction should include all designs, drawings, plans and specifications used by the defendant in making the Bliss-Leavitt torpedo for the government which were approved by the Ordnance Bureau, notice of which was given to the Bliss Company pursuant to the provisions of Clauses 19 and 20 of the contracts in question.'\n\n The court hence directed the amendment of the decree of the District Court, 'adding such a provision.'\n A rehearing was asked of the case, 229 Fed. 376, 143 C. C. A. 496. It was denied as to the balanced turbine and granted as to the other devices, that is, Double Regulation of Air, Ball Bearings for Gyroscope, and Inside Superheater. To the inclusion of these in the decree it is objected, as to the Double Regulation of Air, that written notice was not given the company as required by the restrictive clause. The assertion is that what was done by the government was \n\n[248 U.S. 37, 47]\n\u00a0\n nothing but suggestions, first verbal, and then by letter, but not accompanied by 'blueprints of design.' \n2\n The objection is based on the contention already referred to that a device or design must be something concrete or, it is now said, if not that, 'it at least imports something as to dimensions, size, shape, weight, etc., from which a device could be constructed.' The objection \n\n[248 U.S. 37, 48]\n\u00a0\n is hypercritical and we are somewhat surprised at it. There was no uncertainty in the government's demand and no misunderstanding of it. There were discussions concerning the practical means of using it, and it was testified that 'the sole question practically reducing itself to whether or not they had sufficient space to apply this design or principle.' And the design was subsequently worked out by the employes of the company. The objection was rested on other grounds, and it was rightfully dealt with by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The same objection is not made as to the superheater and the ball bearings. It is said of them that they are not used in the existing type of torpedo. As this is conceded by the government and as we do not agree with its assertion that the company 'displays a disposition to violate its trust whenever it seems advantageous to do so,' we think the decree should not include the devices. In other words, it should be modified to exclude them, without prejudice, however, to the government's right to obtain an injunction against their disclosure upon proper proof of an intention to use the devices in proceedings supplemental to this action or in an independent action.

GARRITY(1918)\nNo. 143\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 97, 98]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. J. Pflaum, of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Ode L. Rankin, of Chicago, Ill., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by Delia Garrity to subject premises in Chicago owned by plaintiffs in error to the payment of a judgment obtained by her against Clarence Green by reason of injury ustained to her means of support through sales of intoxicating liquors to her husband by Green, who was a tenant of the plaintiffs in error occupying and using their premises for the sale of such liquors.\n In her complaint she sets forth that she was the wife of one William J. Garrity; that Clarence Green on June 18, 1912, and for one year prior thereto, was the owner of and did conduct what is commonly known as a saloon or dramshop, and during such period of time sold intoxicating liquors in such shop in a certain building at 134 North Dearborn street, Chicago, standing upon certain permises described in the bill; that on June 18, 1912, she began a suit in the circuit court of Cook county, Illinois against \n\n[246 U.S. 97, 99]\n\u00a0\n said Green, under the provisions of statute of the state of Illinois known as the Dramshop Act (Hurd's Rev. St. 1915-16, c. 43), to recover damages for injury to her means of support, and alleged in the declaration in said suit that she was the wife of William J. Garrity on and prior to June 18, 1912; that said Green sold and gave intoxicating liquors to her husband, which liquor in whole or in part caused the said Garrity to become habitually intoxicated, and alleged injury to her means of support resulting therefrom in the sum of $10,000; that summons was duly served on said Green; that he failed to appear, and on September 26, 1912, an order of default was entered against him, and thereupon the case came for trial before the judge and jury for the assessment of damages; that on October 2, 1914, the court and jury having heard the testimony, the jury returned a verdict finding said Green guilty, assessed the plaintiff's damages in the sum of $1,500, and judgment was rendered accordingly. The bill then alleges leasehold ownership of the land and ownership of the building in the plaintiffs in error, and that for a year or more prior to the filing of the suit in the circuit court of Cook county said Green occupied the building on the premises for the purpose of the sale of intoxicating liquors as tenant of the plaintiffs in error, who leased said building and premises to, and knowingly permitted said building and premises to be occupied by said Green for the sale of intoxicating liquors for the period of a year or more prior to the filing of the suit in the circuit court of Cook county; that the liquors sold or given to Garrity on said premises, were the sales or gifts which resulted in the verdict and judgment aforesaid; and such sales or gifts were made or given while the said Green occupied the said building as tenant of the plaintiffs in error, and with their knowledge and consent, for the purpose of keeping a dramshop, and the complainant seeks to have the building and premises charged with a lien for the payment of the judgment and costs, and \n\n[246 U.S. 97, 100]\n\u00a0\n prays that in default of the payment of the judgment, interest and costs, that said building and the premises described in the bill he sold to satisfy the judgment.\n A demurrer to the bill was overruled and the court made a decree in substance finding the allegations in the bill to be true, and adjudged that in default of the payment of the judgment, with interest, the said building, leasehold and premises of the plaintiffs in error should be subjected to sale for the payment thereof. Upon appeal the Supreme Court of Illionis affirmed the decree, holding, among other things, that the statute did not deprive the plaintiffs in error of their property without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. 272 Ill. 127, 111 N. E. 735. The decree was rendered under section 10, chapter 43, of the Revised Statutes of that state, which provides:\n'For the payment of any judgment for damages and costs that may be recovered against any person in consequence of the sale of intoxicating liquors under the preceding section, the real estate and personal property of such person, of every kind, except such as may be exempt from levy and sale upon judgment and execution, shall be liable; a d such judgment shall be a lien upon such real estate until paid; and in case any person shall rent or lease to another any building or premises to be used or occupied, in whole or in part, for the sale of intoxicating liquors, or shall knowingly permit the same to be so used or occupied, such building or premises so used or occupied shall be held liable for and may be sold to pay any such judgment against any person occupying such building or premises. Proceedings may be had to subject the same to the payment of any such judgment recovered, which remains unpaid, or any part thereof, either before or after execution shall issue against the property of the person against whom such judgment shall have been recovered; and when execution shall issue against the property so \n\n[246 U.S. 97, 101]\n\u00a0\n leased or rented, the officer shall proceed to satisfy said execution out of the building or premises so leased or occupied, as aforesaid: Provided, that if such building or premises belong to a minor or other person under guardianship, the guardian or conservator of such person, and his real and personal property, shall be held liable instead of such ward, and his property shall be subject to all the provisions of this section relating to the collection of said judgment.'\n\n Construing this section with the preceding section (9) (printed in the margin1) the Supreme Court of Illinois held that the purpose of section 10 was to make the building or premises used for the sale of intoxicating liquors liable for the payment of a judgment rendered against the occupant of the premises wherein the liquor was sold, provided the \n\n[246 U.S. 97, 102]\n\u00a0\n owner had rented the same to be used or occupied for the sale of intoxicating liquors, or knowingly permitted the same to be so used and occupied. The court held that the judgment against the tenant, in the absence of fraud or collusion, was conclusive in the action under section 10 to subject the building and premises to its payment, except that the owner of the building is entitled to controvert the allegations that he had knowingly rented or knowingly permitted his building to be used for the sale of intoxicating liquor, and that a judgment had been recovered against the occupant for damages arising from the sale of liquor therein. The question in this court is whether the act, as thus construed, deprives the plaintiffs in error of their property without due process of law.\n The right of the states to pass laws for the regulation of the traffic in intoxicating liquors, and to legislate with a view to repress the evil consequences which may result therefrom, has been frequently affirmed in this court. Cramer v. Campbell, \n245 U.S. 304\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 98, 62 L. Ed. --, decided December 10, 1917. In the opinion in that case the former cases in this court sustaining the authority of the state to deal with the evils resulting from the sale and use of intoxicating liquor are cited, and we need not review them now.\n Under this broad power over the liquor traffic, and the right to pass legislation to prevent its evils, the state of Illinois has made the premises of an owner in that state subject to a lien for damages recovered by a wife for injury to her means of support against one who has furnished the husband intoxicating liquor which was sold upon the premises sought to be charged, when the owner had rented the same for the purpose of the sale of intoxicating liquor, or had knowingly permitted such sales upon his premises.\n The owner of such building has no absolute right to rent his property for any and all purposes. The use of property may be regulated under the police power of the \n\n[246 U.S. 97, 103]\n\u00a0\n state in the public interest in such manner as to safeguard the health and welfare of the community. Certainly there is no right beyond the reach of legislative control, to rent premises for the sale of intoxicating liquor. The state may consistently with due process of law prohibit the rental of premises for such purposes. In this instance it has undertaken to r gulate the right to rent property for the sale of intoxicating liquors by making the premises so used subject to a lien for a judgment for damages because of the deprivation of the means of support of the wife resulting from the intoxication of the husband upon whom she depends for support. Obviously, the state may pass laws to meet this as well as other evil consequences likely to follow from the traffic. See Marvin v. Trout, \n199 \nU.S. 212, 224\n, 225 S., 26 Sup. Ct. 31.\n The stress of the argument for plaintiff in error is laid upon the want of notice to the landlord and the lack of opportunity to be heard as to the right of recovery and the amount thereof, before his property can be subjected to the lien of such judgment. But the effect of this statute is to make the landlord responsible only when he rents his property for the use and sale of intoxicants, or knowingly permits its use for that purpose. The statute has the effect of making the tenant the agent of the landlord for its purposes, and through this agency, voluntarily assumed, the landlord becomes a participant in the sales of intoxicants and is responsible for the consequences resulting from them.\n It was the owner's privilege to rent the property to a lessee of his own choosing, and to safeguard himself by the amount of the rent reserved, or otherwise, for the possible damages resulting from the traffic in intoxicants which the landlord has agreed may be carried on in his premises. The property is not summarily taken, the owner may be heard to deny the rendition of the judgment against the tenant, the making of the lease author- \n\n[246 U.S. 97, 104]\n\u00a0\n izing the sale of intoxicating liquor, or, if his knowledge of such use be the issue, he may be heard upon that question.

Rep. 323.\n In view of the broad authority of the states over the liquor traffic, and the established right to prohibit or regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors, we are unable to discover that there has been a deprivation of property rights in the legislation in question in violation of due process of law secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 9: 'Every husband, wife, child, parent, guardian, employer or other person, who shall be injured in person or property, or means of support, by any intoxicated person, or in consequence of the intoxication, habitual or otherwise, of any person, shall have a right of action in his or her own name, severally or jointly, against any person or persons who shall, by selling or giving intoxicating liquors, have caused the intoxication, in whole or in part, of such person or persons; and any person owning, renting, leasing or permitting the occupation of any building or premises, and having knowledge that intoxicating liquors are to be sold therein, or who have leased the same for other purposes, shall knowingly permit therein the sale of any intoxicating liquors that have caused, in whole or in part, the intoxication of any person, shall be liable, severally or jointly, with the person or persons selling or giving intoxicating liquors aforesaid, for all damages sustained, and for exemplary damages; and a married woman shall have the same right to bring suits and to control the same and the amount recovered, as a feme sole; and all damages recovered by a minor under this act shall be paid either to such minor, or to his or her parent, guardian or next friend, as the court shall direct; and the unlawful sale, or giving away, of intoxication liquors, shall work a forfeiture of all rights of the lessee or tenant, under any lease or contract of rent upon the premises where such unlawful sale or giving away shall take place; and all suits for damages under this Act may be by any appropriate action in any of the courts of this state having competent jurisdiction.' \n\n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nERIE R.

The plaintiff was a boy less than seven years old and had been playing marbles near the siding when a marble rolled under a car. The boy tried to reach the marble with his foot and while he was doing so the car was backed and his left leg was so badly hurt that it had to be cut off. A statute of New Jersey provides that 'if any person shall be injured by an engine or car while walking, standing or playing on any railroad, he shall be deemed to have contributed to the injury sustained, and shall not recover therefor any damages from the company owning or operating said railroad,' with a proviso that the section shall not apply to the crossing of a railroad at a lawful crossing. General Railroad Law,  55; Compiled Stat. 1910, p. 4245, citing P. L. 1903, p. 673. The trial court notwithstanding this statute, allowed the plaintiff to go to the jury and to obtain and keep a verdict, following such precedents in the circuit as Erie R. Co. v. Swiderski, 197 Fed. 521, 117 C. C. A. 17, and the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 246 Fed. 800.\n The ground of the decision seemingly is that the statute does not appear beyond doubt to apply to very young infants, although the word 'playing' sufficiently indicates that it had minors in view, even if the absoluteness of the opening phrase 'any person' were not enough to exclude the reading in of exceptions by the Court. The words of the statute seem to us to require a different construction from that adopted and they have been given their full literal meaning by the Supreme Court of the State in the case of an infant younger than the plaintiff. Barcolini v. Atlantic City & Shore R. R. Co., 82 N. J. Law, 107, 81 Atl. 494. In view of the importance of that tribunal in New \n\n[247 U.S. 97, 101]\n\u00a0\n Jersey, although not the highest Court in the State, we see no reason why it should not be followed by the Courts of the United States, even if we thought its decision more doubtful than we do.\n There is no ground for the argument that the plaintiff was invited upon the tracks. Temptation is not always invitation. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co. v. Reich, 61 N. J. Law, 635, 40 Atl. 682, 41 L. R. A. 831, 68 Am. St. Rep. 727; Holbrook v. Aldrich, 168 Mass. 15, 16, 46 N. E. 115, 36 L. R. A. 493, 60 Am. St. Rep. 364; Romana v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co., 218 Mass. 76, 105 N. E. 598, L. R. A. 1915A, 510, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 893. In this case too the plaintiff was not moved by the temptation, if any, offered by the cars, but by the wish to recover his marble. Therefore it is unnecessary to consider whether an express invitation would have affected the case, or what conclusion properly could be drawn from the fact that children had played in that neighborhood before and sometimes had been ordered away. The statute seemingly adopts in an unqualified form the policy of the common law as understood we believe in New Jersey, Massachusetts, and some other States, that while a landowner cannot intentionally injure or lay traps for a person coming upon his premises without license, he is not bound to provide for the trespasser's safety from other undisclosed dangers, or to interrupt his own otherwise lawful occupations to provide for the chance that some one may be unlawfully there.

The facts, about which there is no dispute, are these: In 1916 the District Court by a decree in a pending suit awarded $95,770, then in the registry of the court, to five solicitors as the balance due to them collectively for services in the suit, and directed that this sum be apportioned among them according to the relative amount and value of the services of each, due regard being had for payments already made. Control of the suit and fund was retained to enable the court to make the apportionment and carry it into effect. The solicitors appeared in the suit and while proceedings looking to an apportionment were pending one of the solicitors died. He was a resident of Texas and was survived by a widow and son, both living in that state. By his will, regularly presented for probate in Texas, his entire estate, excepting $1 bequeathed to the son, was devised and bequeathed to the widow, and she was named as sole executrix. The will was what is known under the laws of Texas as an 'independent' will, the same containing a direction that no action should be had thereunder other than to probate it and to return an inventory and appraisement. See Tex. Civ. Stat. 1914, art. 3362 et seq. After the will was presented and while it was awaiting probate in regular course the court in Texas appointed the widow \n\n[246 U.S. 128, 130]\n\u00a0\n temporary administratrix and directed her in that capacity to take charge of the estate and do whatever was necessary to obtain the deceased's portion of the fund awaiting distribution in the District Court. She qualified as temporary administratrix and as such presented in the suit a motion asking that it be revived by substituting her as a party in the place of the deceased. A few days later the public administrator of St. Louis, Missouri, acting under an order of the probate court of that city, presented in the suit a motion, erroneously styled an intervening petition, asserting that he was the deceased's only legal representative in Missouri and insisting in effect that the revivor be in his name.\n These conflicting motions were heard together, were argued orally and in elaborate briefs by counsel for the respective applicants for substitution, and were considered in a memorandum opinion wherein the judge, after indicating that a revivor was essential and that the question for decision was as to which of the two applicants was the proper party to be substituted in the place of the deceased, reac ed the conclusion that the revivor should be in the name of the widow as temporary administratrix. An order was accordingly entered granting her motion and denying that of the public administrator. That order was dated October 29, 1917\n\n\n November 6, 1917, the will was regularly admitted to probate in Texas, and the judgment by which this was done contained an express finding that there was no debt to be paid and no occasion for administration upon the estate. The widow then presented in the suit a motion setting up the probate of the will with the finding made in that connection and insisting that this and the terms of the will operated under the laws of Texas1 to invest \n\n[246 U.S. 128, 131]\n\u00a0\n her in her individual capacity with the full right, title and interest of the deceased in the fund as of the date of his death. The motion concluded by asking for an order recognizing and substituting her in her individual right as the successor in interest and title of the deceased. A hearing was had upon this motion and the same was granted November 19, 1917.\n That was the date on which this court, after examining the present petition of the public administrator, granted leave to file the same and ordered that a rule to show cause issue against the defendant judge.\n Mr. George B. Webster, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner. \n\n[246 U.S. 128, 132]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jacob Chasnoff, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n It now appears that the petition gives an inadmissible coloring to the matter in respect of which it seeks relief. We say this because the petition implies that the court \n\n[246 U.S. 128, 133]\n\u00a0\n did not consider but summarily rejected the public administrator's motion for a revivor in his name, whereas in fact the court heard oral argument on the motion, gave time for filing and received briefs thereon, and ultimately denied the motion for reasons given in a memorandum opinion. The petition makes no reference to this; neither does it mention the conflicting motion by the temporary administratrix which was heard at the same time, dealt with in the same memorandum opinion and granted by the same order that denied the public administrator's motion. These matters and the subsequent proceedings are all brought to our attention by the return, the accuracy of which is not questioned.\n When the unwarranted coloring of the petition is put aside and what actually was done is considered in its true light, it is manifest that the situation is not one in which a writ of mandamus will lie.\n Of course, the death of one of the parties having an interest in the fund operated to suspend the proceedings for its apportionment until some one legally capable of asserting and defending that interest should either come or be brought into the suit in the place of the deceased. Formerly such a substitution was effected through a bill of revivor or a bill of that nature (\n210 U.S. 526\n, 33 Sup. Ct. xxxiv, rule 56; Story's Equity Pleadings [9th Ed.]  354, 356, 364); but the new equity rules provide that the court may, 'upon motion, order the suit to be revived by the substitution of the proper parties' (\n226 U.S. 661\n, 33 Sup. Ct. xxx, rule 45). Whether a particular applicant for substitution is the proper party is a question for the court to determine, just as is the question whether a particular suit is brought by or against the proper party. In either case the question is to be resolved by applying recognized legal and equitable principles to the facts in hand; in other words, by an exercise of the judicial function. If the suit be one which may be revived, as where the cause of action or claim in contro- \n\n[246 U.S. 128, 134]\n\u00a0\n versy survives, revivor in the name of the proper party is a matter of right, and, if it be denied, the denial may be reviewed and corrected upon appeal.

A. 270; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. United States & Mexican Trust Co., 221 Fed. 545, 552, 137 C. C. A. 113.\n When the two conflicting motions for revivor were presented it devolved upon the court to consider and decide which, if either, of the applicants was entitled to substitution. A full hearing was had and in regular course the court ruled that one applicant was and the other was not the proper party, and then entered an order reviving the suit accordingly. That was a judicial act done in the exercise of a jurisdiction conferred by law, and even if erroneous, was not void or open to collateral attack, but only subject to correction upon appeal.\n'The accustomed office of a writ of mandamus, when directed to a judicial officer, is to compel an exercise of existing jurisdiction, but not to control his decision. It does not lie to compel a reversal of a decision, either interlocutory or final, made in the exercise of a lawful jurisdiction, especially where in regular course the decision may be reviewed upon a writ of error or an appeal.'

U.S.(1918)\nNo. 277\nArgued: May 1, 1918Decided: June 10, 1918\n\n\n\n This suit was brought in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado to cancel nine coal land patents embracing 1,120 acres of land in Colorado which, it was charged, had been procured from the United States by fraud. A further purpose of the suit was to cancel deeds of the same land from various persons to one Philip L. Foster alleged to be in secret trust for the Exploration Company, a foreign corporation, for whose benefit it is alleged the frauds were committed. Six of the patents were of date of October 16, 1902, and three of date of September 6, 1902. The suit was brought March 3, 191 , about eight and a half years after the dates of the patents, the bill alleging that the fraud by which the patents were obtained was self-concealing in its nature, was concealed from the government by the wrongdoers and was not discovered until 1909. The defendants demurred on the ground that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations, and the demurrer was sustained by the District Court. 190 Fed. 405. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed this decision, and the \n\n[247 U.S. 435, 436]\n\u00a0\n case was sent back to the District Court. 203 Fed. 387, 121 C. C. A. 491. After trial a decree was rendered against the defendants, the present plaintiffs in error. 225 Fed. 854. This decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (235 Fed. 110, 148 C. C. A. 604), and the case comes here.\n The District Court found the following facts:\n The Exploration Company, defendant herein, is a corporation of Great Britian, authorized to purchase, own, and operate mines, and to purchase and own shares of stock in mines in all parts of the world. It was the owner of mines and mining lands in different parts of the world, and also of shares of stock of corporations engaged in mining in the United States and other countries. In 1901, and for several years thereafter, its representative in this country was Charles A. Molson, to whom it had executed a general power of attorney to represent it in all matters in the United States. The Exploration Company desired to acquire certain coal lands in the state of Colorado, which were a part of the public domain of the United States, but was unable to do so because it was a foreign corporation, and desired more of these coal lands than a domestic corporation could obtain under the laws of the United States. It therefore conceived and carried into effect the following scheme for the purpose of acquiring them: Mr. Molson employed one Henry Burrell to obtain title to the lands. Burrell employed other agents, who were sent to residents of Colorado, legally entitled to acquire public coal lands from the United States, and induced them to make entry of such lands as were pointed out to them by the Exploration Company's agents, and which were supposed to contain valuable veins of coal. A large number of such entries were made on lands situated in the counties of Gunnison and Delta, the parties having filed declaratory statements as required by law. Many of these lands were abandoned and no patents applied for, but the filings on the lands herein involved were paid for and \n\n[247 U.S. 435, 437]\n\u00a0\n patents therefor secured. Henry Burrell was a witness in most, if not all, of these entries. The parties who made the entries were promised the sum of twenty-five dollars for their services in so doing. Burrell was to pay all fees, as well as the purchase money, with funds furnished by the Exploration Company. The entry men and women executed deeds of conveyance for their respective tracts of land and delivered them to Burrell as soon as the final proofs were made and the money paid by the Exploration Company's agent to the respective officers of the land offices within whose jurisdiction the lands were situated. Henry Burrell caused these deeds to be made to Alexander Burrell, his brother, and Alexander Burrell later conveyed the lands to Alberta L. Smith, a resident of Montana, the only consideration for the conveyance being that Smith promised to hold them in trust for and to convey them to any person designated by the agent of the Exploration Company. The agent Charles A. Molson having died, the Exploration Company appointed Philip L. Foster to succeed him as its duly authorized general agent in the United States, and Smith conveyed these lands to Foster, without any other consideration, who holds the legal title in secret trust for the Exploration Company. In 1902 patents to these lands were issued by the United States, but the fact that they were secured by false affidavits, and not for the benefit of the entry men and women, but for the sole benefit of the Exploration Company, who in reality paid the gover ment the purchase money, was kept secret, and did not become known to any of the officers of the government, nor did any facts become known to them which could arouse the suspicion of one reasonably diligent that the patents had been obtained by false affidavits for the sole benefit of the Exploration Company until 1909, more than six years after issuance of the patents, and then it only became known to the officers of the government by reason of the fact that a \n\n[247 U.S. 435, 438]\n\u00a0\n Utah corporation had acquired a great many of the public lands in the same manner that these lands were obtained, and this being discovered in 1909, the Secretary of the Interior directed in that year an examination of all coal-land entries made in the states of Utah and Colorado. The facts were for the first time discovered in this investigation. There was nothing in the records, or on file in the General Land Office of the United States or the Department of the Interior which could possibly have aroused a suspicion that these lands had been obtained for the sole benefit of the Exploration Company until the reports of the special agents of the General Land Office were made in the latter part of 1909. As soon as the facts were ascertained, the Secretary of the Interior transmitted them to the Department of Justice, with the request to institute suits to set aside the patents to the lands, and this suit was accordingly instituted on March 3, 1911, several months less than two years after the discovery of the alleged fraudulent acts.\n The District Court found that the defendants did not actively conceal the facts which constitute fraud in this case by enjoining silence on the entrymen and patentees, or by directing them or the agents who acted for it to refuse to give any information relating to the entries, if asked by the officers of the government, but were guilty of a passive concealment. When the investigation was made by the agents of the General Land Office, in 1909, in relation to these entries, the patentees, as well as the company's agents stated the facts truthfully, but until that time the fact that the entries were all made for the benefit of the Exploration Company, and that the legal title held by the defendant Foster was for the benefit of the company, was concealed. There were no facts or circumstances within the knowledge of any official of the government prior to the investigation in 1909 which could arouse even a bare suspicion that the entries were made in the manner hereinbefore described and for the benefit of the Exploration Company. \n\n[247 U.S. 435, 439]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry McAllister, Jr., and George E. Tralles, both of Denver, Colo., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 435, 442]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful, for the United States.\n\n\n[247 U.S. 435, 445]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals found that the evidence fully supported the findings of the trial court. We find no occasion to disturb the findings of fact by two courts. The question presented for our consideration is whether the suit was barred by the statute of limitations under the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26 Stat. 1099 (Comp. St. 1916,  5114), which provides:\n'That suits by the United States to vacate and annul any patent heretofore issued shall only be brought within five years from the passage of this act, and suits to vacate and annul patents hereafter issued shall only be brought within six years after the date of the issuance of such patents.' \n\n[247 U.S. 435, 446]\n\u00a0\n As averred in the bill, and found by the courts, the frauds were concealed until after six years had elapsed from the issuance of the patents. 'After it was supposed the statute of limitations had barred any action, the participants in the fraud talked very freely, telling the truth when it was thought it would do no harm.' It is the contention of the appellants that the statute was intended to bar all actions after six years from the date of the issuance of the patent, that if for six years the governmen has failed to discover the fraud, no matter what its diligence in that respect may be, its action against the guilty parties is forever barred, and they may hold in security the lands thus obtained by grant from the United States by means of fraud perpetrated in defiance of its laws enacted for the disposition of the public domain. We are unable to agree with this contention. We think the true rule is established in federal jurisprudence by the decision of this court in Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342. In that case a question was presented under the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 (Act March 2, 1867, c. 176, 14 Stat. 517), which provided that no suit at law or in equity should be maintained by or against an assignee in bankruptcy, or by or against any person claiming an adverse interest, touching the property or rights of property of the bankrupt, in any court whatever, unless the same should be brought within two years from the time the cause of action accrued for or against the assignee. The action was brought to set aside a conveyance on the ground of fraud. Among other things it was charged that the bankrupt, his wife, son and father-in-law being defendants in the case, kept secret their fraudulent acts and endeavored to conceal them from the knowledge both of the assignee and of Winston & Company, a creditor proving a debt, whereby both were prevented from obtaining any sufficient knowledge or information thereof until within the previous two years, and that even up to the time suit was instituted they had not been able to obtain \n\n[247 U.S. 435, 447]\n\u00a0\n full and particular information as to the fraudulent disposition made by the bankrupt of a large part of his property. A general demurrer was filed to the bill on the ground that the suit was not brought within two years as required by the statute. It is thus apparent that no attempt was made to prosecute the action within two years from the time the same accrued. It was contended that the statute was imperative, that it made no exceptions, and that the action was consequently barred by limitation. This court, after a full review of decisions English and American, decided that notwithstanding the positive terms of the statute, it did not begin to run until after the discovery of the fraud. In the course of the opinion Mr. Justice Miller said:\n\n'They [statutes of limitation] were enacted to prevent frauds; to prevent parties from asserting rights after the lapse of time had destroyed or impaired the evidence which would show that such rights never existed, or had been satisfied, transferred, or extinguished, if they ever did exist. To hold that by concealing a fraud, or by committing a fraud in a manner that it concealed itself until such time as the party committing the fraud could plead the statute of limitations to protect it, is to make the law which was designed to prevent fraud the means by which it is made successful and secure.'\n\n It will be observed in that statute, as in the one now under consideration, there was no provision that the cause of action should not be deemed to have accrued until the discovery of the fraud. But it was held that for the purpose of such statutes the cause of action did not accrue until the discovery of the fraud; that such was the undisputed doctrine of courts of equity, and that the weight of authority, English and American, applied the same rule to actions at law.\n Among other cases cited by Mr. Justice Miller is the decision of Mr. Justice Story at the circuit in Sherwood \n\n[247 U.S. 435, 448]\n\u00a0\n v. Sutton, 5 Mason, 143, 21 Fed. Cas. p. 1303, No. 12,782. That case involved a statute of the state of New Hampshire which provided that actions for fraud and deceit should be brought within six years. It contained no exception as to actions founded on fraud where the same had been concealed during the period of limitation, and the question was whether such exception was implied. The cases were very fully reviewed by Mr. Justice Story, and in holding that the statute did not begin to run until the disc very of the fraud, he said (21 Fed. Cas. 1307):\n'What, then, is the reason, upon which this exception has been established? It is, that every statute is to be expounded reasonably, so as to suppress, and not to extend, the mischiefs, which it was designed to cure. The statute of limitations was mainly intended to suppress fraud, by preventing fraudulent and unjust claims from starting up at great distances of time, when the evidence might no longer be within the reach of the other party, by which they could be repelled. It ought not, then, to be so construed, as to become an instrument to encourage fraud, if it admits of any other reasonable interpretation; and cases of fraud, therefore, form an implied exception, to be acted upon by courts of law and equity, according to the nature of their respective jurisdictions. Such, it seems to me, is the reason on which the exception is built, and not merely that there is an equity binding upon the conscience of the party which the statute does not reach or control.'\n\n Bailey v. Glover has never been overruled nor modified in this court and has been approved and followed. Rosenthal v. Walker, \n111 \nU.S. 185, 190\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 382; Traer v. Clews, \n115 \nU.S. 528, 537\n, 538 S., 6 Sup. Ct. 155; Kirby v. Lake Shore, etc., R. R. Co., \n120 \nU.S. 130, 136\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 430; Avery v. Cleary, \n132 \nU.S. 604, 609\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 220. It was also applied in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the case of Linn & Lane Timber Co. v. United States, 196 Fed. 593, 116 C. C. A. 267; 203 Fed. 394, 121 C. C. A. 498. \n\n[247 U.S. 435, 449]\n\u00a0\n It is true that Mr. Justice Brewer, in delivering the opinion of the court, in United States v. Winona, etc., R. R. Co., \n165 \nU.S. 463, 476\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 368, said that no matter what the mistake or error of the Land Department was, or what the frauds of the patentee, the patent would become conclusive as a transfer of title after the lapse of six years. But the learned justice said in the same opinion that this limitation could not be availed of because the suit was commenced before the expiration of the time prescribed, and that it was referred to as showing the purpose of Congress to uphold titles arising under certification or patent after the lapse of a certain time. It therefore appears that the question was not involved in that case. Nor does it contain any discussion of the doctrine previously laid down in Bailey v. Glover, supra.\n In United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n209 U.S. 447\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 579, cited by appellants, no question was made as to the effect of concealment of fraud until after the running of the statute. The same is true of Louisiana v. Garfield, \n211 U.S. 70\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 31, also relied upon by appellants.\n When Congress passed the act in question the rule of Bailey v. Glover was the established doctrine of this court. It was presumably enacted with the ruling of that case in mind. We cannot believe that Congress intended to give immunity to those who for the period named in the statute might be able to conceal their fraudulent action from the knowledge of the agents of the government. We are aware of no good reason why the rule, now almost universal, that statutes of limitations to set aside fraudulent transactions shall not begin to run until the discovery of the fraud, should not apply in favor of the government as well as a private individual. It is not our belief that Congress intended that the government should be deprived of title to public lands by those who add to the fraud by which they were obtained artifices which enabled them to conceal the fraudulent manner \n\n[247 U.S. 435, 450]\n\u00a0\n in which they were secured until the action was supposed to be barred by the lapse of six years.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER dissent.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in this decision. \n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFRIEDERICHSEN v.

Gilmore, who in the transaction acted through her agent, Edward Renard, the decedent of the respondent G. H. Renard. We shall refer to the parties as they were in the courts below, Friederichsen as plaintiff, and Gilmore and Renard as defendants.\n On September 22, 1908, Friederichsen filed a bill in equity in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, praying for a decree canceling the contract and the deed made pursuant thereto and for damages sustained, on the ground of fraud practiced upon him.\n Defendants answered denying the fraud charged, and on August 20, 1912, a master, theretofore appointed in the case, reported that Friederichsen at the time of the exchange 'was below the average in mental ability'; that he had been induced to enter into the contract by the fraudulent representations of Renard, as alleged; and that he had sustained damage in the sum of $5,880. But the master also reported that Friederichsen, after taking possession of the Virginia lands, after filing his bill in the case, and after having had time to discover the condition \n\n[247 U.S. 207, 209]\n\u00a0\n and value of the land, had cut down a considerable amount of timber growing thereon.\n On the coming in of this report, the court on September 19, 1913, found that the plaintiff was not entitled to equitable relief because he had ratified the contract of exchange by cutting timber on the Virginia lands, thereby preventing the defendants from being placed in statu quo, but that his remedy was at law for damages, and thereupon it was ordered: that the master's report be vacated; that pursuant to equity rule 22 (33 Sup. Ct. xxiv) the cause be transferred to the law side of the court; and 'that the parties file amended pleadings to conform with an action at law.'\n Complying with this order, on September 25, 1913, the plaintiff filed an 'amended petition' on the law side of the court, and, upon the same facts stated in the original bill in equity, prayed for a judgment for damages. The defendants filed answers the same in substance as those filed in the equity suit, but adding the defense that the cause of action stated in the amended petition was barred by the Nebraska four-year statute of limitations.\n When the case came on for trial, and after it was stipulated by counsel for the defendants that the plaintiff had introduced sufficient evidence to entitle him to recover a verdict, unless barred by the statute of limitations, it was ruled 'that the cause of action stated in the plaintiff's amended petition was barred by the statute of limitations of the state of Nebraska and that the filing of the amended petition did not relate back to the commencement of the action in such a way as to prevent the bar of the statute,' and a verdict was directed for the defendants. The judgment entered on this verdict affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, is now before us for review on writ of certiorari.\n Thus the case presents for decision the single question, whether the filing of the 'amended petition' on the law \n\n[247 U.S. 207, 210]\n\u00a0\n side of the court on September 25, 1913, was the commencement of a new action more than four years after the fraud was discovered (which must have been prior to the filing of the bill in equity on September 22, 1908), which was therefore barred, or whether the proceeding at law was but pursuing toward a conclusion, in another form, the same cause of action stated in the original bill, so that the suspension of the statute of limitations continued, which began with the date of the service of the subpoena in chancery.\n It is argued by the respondents that in the bill in equity the petitioner disaffirmed, while in the amended petition he affirmed, the contract of exchange; that the latter, for this reason, states a new and different cause of action from the former, and that, against this new cause of action, the running of the statute of limitations was not arrested until the amended petition was filed, and that then it had become barred.\n But the allegations of fraud in the two papers are the same in substance, and practically the same in form, the only substantial difference between them being that the prayer for relief in the bill is for mutual return of lands, with incidental damages, while in the amended petition, it is for damages alone. The cause of action is the wrong done, not the measure of compensation for it, or the character of the relief sought, and, considered as a matter of substance, the change in the statement of that wrong in the amended petition cannot in any just sense be considered a new or different cause of action.\n It is settled upon reason and authority that the conversion of a suit in equity into an action at law or vice versa is not alone sufficient to constitute the beginning of a new action and that with respect to the statute of limitations it is a mere incident in the progress of the original case.\n It was so held by the Supreme Court of Nebraska long \n\n[247 U.S. 207, 211]\n\u00a0\n prior to the origin of the controversy we have here, when an action in ejectment was converted into a suit to redeem (McKeighan v. Hopkins, 19 Neb. 33, 26 N. W. 614), and again, in Butler v. Smith, 84 Neb. 78, 120 N. W. 1106, 28 L. R. A. (N. S.) 436, in a similar case in 1909, the question was held not to be an open one.\n In Smith v. Butler, 176 Mass. 38, 57 N. E. 322, followed with approval in 1917 in Reynolds v. M., K. & T. R. R. Co. (Mass.) 117 N. E. 913, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts declared that it had been the settled practice in that commonwealth for a period of over fifty years to allow actions at law to be amended into suits in equity, in place of putting the plaintiff to a new suit, and to 'allow those amendments on the ground that if a new suit were brought, it would be barred by the statute.' It will suffice to add that in Schurmeier v. Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co., 171 Fed. 1, 96 C. C. A. 107, the Circuit Court of Appeals, a judgment of which we are here reviewing, held that the amendment of a law action into one in equity for the express purpose of meeting an anticipated defense of the statute of limitations, did not change the cause of action and that the amendment related to the time of the commencement of the action.\n There remains to be considered the ground on which the lower courts chiefly rested their judgment, viz.: That, in disaffirming the contract by his suit in equity, the petitioner elected to pursue one of two inconsistent remedies open to him, until the period o the statute of limitations had expired, and that he therefore cannot escape that bar when afterwards, by amendment of his pleadings, he seeks to affirm the contract and recover damages.\n No matter what may be thought of the merit of the doctrine of election of remedies, it is a long observed and deeply entrenched rule of procedure. But, for obvious reasons, it has never been a favorite of equity and it has been specifically decided by this court that the two forms of relief pursued, before and after the amendment of the \n\n[247 U.S. 207, 212]\n\u00a0\n pleadings in this case, are not so inconsistent but that both may be prayed for in one bill in equity and either granted, as the evidence and the equities of the case may require. Thus, in Hardin v. Boyd, \n113 U.S. 756\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 771, in a suit to annul a land contract for fraud the trial court permitted an amendment to the bill, adding a prayer in the alternative for a decree affirming the contract, granting a lien for the unpaid purchase money and for foreclosure. The decree in the case was entered on the alternative prayer.\n This court affirmed that decree on principle and authority holding that:\n'Under the liberal rules of chancery practice which now obtain, there is no sound reason why the original bill in this case might not have been framed with a prayer for the cancellation of the contract upon the ground of fraud, and an accounting between the parties, and, in the alternative, for a decree which, without disturbing the contract, would give a lien on the lands for unpaid purchase money. ... The amendment had no other effect than to make the bill read just as it might have been originally prepared consistently with the established rules of equity practice. It suggested no change or modification of its allegations, and, in no just sense, made a new case.'\n\n In view of the new equity rules of 1912, especially rule 22, and of the Act of Congress of March 3, 1915 (38 Stat. at L. 956, c. 90 [Comp. St. 1916,  1251a, 1251b, 1251c]), it cannot be said that the power of courts of equity to amend pleadings, or to permit them to be amended, to accomplish the ends of justice, has been curtailed since the Hardin Case was decided in 1884\n\n\n Thus in express terms was it decided that a properly framed prayer would have allowed the petitioner the relief in equity which he sought before the amendment or, in the alternative, that for which he now prays, and to this it must be added, that the order which converted his suit in equity into an action at law was made in the exercise \n\n[247 U.S. 207, 213]\n\u00a0\n of a chancellor's discretion under warrant of an equity rule.\n At best this doctrine of election of remedies is a harsh, and now largely obsolete rule, the scope of which should not be extended, as it must be in order to reach the case at bar, for here the 'amended petition' was not filed by petitioner's counsel of their own motion, but on the order of the court, entered in its discretion, to promote the ends of justice.\n Thus, we are brought to the conclusion that since the two remedies asserted by the petitioner were alternative remedies, and since the order made, requiring the conversion of the suit in equity into one at law, was entered by the court sitting in chancery, for us to affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the petitioner, in obeying the order of the trial court, made a fatal choice of an inconsistent remedy, would be to subordinate substance to form of procedure, with the result of defeating a claim which the respondents stipulated had been sufficiently established to justify a verdict against them. This we cannot consent to do.\n The questions of procedure being thus cleared away, there is little further difficulty with the case. As we have seen the 'amended petition' was not filed in a new case but was simply a step forward in progress toward settlement of the original controversy; the allegations of fact are precisely the same in substance, and almost the same in form, as they were in the original bill and therefore looki g to substance and realities, they cannot be regarded as stating a new cause of action. The case falls clearly within the scope of the principle of the decisions of this court in Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Cox, \n145 U.S. 593\n-604, 12 Sup. Ct. 905; Atlantic & Pacific R. R. Co. v. Laird, \n164 \nU.S. 393, 401\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 120; M., K. & T. Ry. Co. v. Wulf, \n226 U.S. 570\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 135, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 134; Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Renn, \n241 U.S. 290\n, 36 Sup.

Wyler, \n158 U.S. 285\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 877, is so clearly distinguished in the Wulf Case, supra, from the principle of tnese decisions that additional comment would be superfluous.\n It results that the judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals and of the District Court must be reversed and the cause remanded to the latter for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGARDINER v. WILLIAM S. BUTLER & CO.(1918)\nNo. 95\nArgued: December 18, 1917Decided: February 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 603, 604]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alexander Whiteside and Bentley W. Warren, both of Boston, Mass., and Francis B. James, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Frederick H. Nash and Charles F. Choate, Jr., both of Boston, Mass., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES dilivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here upon the report of a master asking the Court to decide whether two claims are provable. The first is upon a lease made by the petitioner to William S. Butler & Company. Receivers were appointed for the William S. Butler & Company corporation on November 7, 1912. At that time the winding up of the company was not contemplated by the bill or decree, but the object was to preserve the good will and pay the debts. On October 1, 1913, the petitioner entered, and on December 1, 1913, presented his proof of claims. The lease contained a clause similar to that in the lease of Wm. Filene's Sons Co., just considered (\n245 U.S. 597\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 211, 62 L. Ed. --), providing that in case of reentry the lessee should pay to the lessor the difference between the rental value and the rent and other payments required for the residue of the term. The claim was for rent up to the time of r entry and for damages for the later period. It was rejected by the courts below upon the same grounds as in the former case. 230 Fed. 1021, 144 C. C. A. 663. This decision, like the other, must be reversed. \n\n[245 U.S. 603, 605]\n\u00a0\n The second claim is upon a lease by Russell to the same company of which Gardiner had purchased the reversion. In substance it is for damages similar to those held allowable under the former lease, but simply on the ground that the petitioner has lost the benefit of his bargain from the time of his reentry, the lease not containing any clause stipulating for such an allowance. Of course there are plausible analogies for the contention. But the law as to leases is not a matter of logic in vacuo; it is a matter of history that has not forgotten Lord Coke. Massachusetts has followed the English tradition and we believe that it is the general understanding in that State that in the absence of statute or express contract a lessor who has terminated a lease and evicted the tenant has no further claim against the lessee.

FENNER(1918)\nNo. 261\nArgued: April 24, 1918Decided: May 6, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. Williams Winans Wall, of New Orleans, La., G. T. Fitzhugh, of Memphis, Tenn., and Thomas Gilmore, of New Orleans, La., for appellant.\n Mr. George Denegre, of New Orleans, La., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill brought by the appellant, alleging himself to be a citizen of Tennessee, to require the principal appellee, the executor under his mother's will, appointed and qualified in Louisiana, to pay over to him one-third of his mother's estate-that being the proportion to which \n\n[247 U.S. 16, 17]\n\u00a0\n he is admitted to be ultimately entitled. The defendants allege that the appellant is a citizen of Louisiana and pronounced incapable of taking care of his person and administering his estate, by a judgment of interdiction of the Louisiana Courts. They say that the estate has not yet been fully administered as no final account has been filed and that until the interdiction is set aside an account can be rendered and possession of the appellant's share delivered only to a curator; but that appointment of a curator has been delayed by the appellant's having taken a writ of error from this Court to the Supreme Court of the State in respect of its interdiction decree. 136 La. 958, 68 South. 89. Dismissed, \n242 U.S. 367\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 165.\n Pending an application to the Supreme Court of the State for a rehearing, Gasquet, who was in custody, obtained his release on habeas corpus from a lower court, afterwards declared by the Supreme Court to have been without jurisdiction, and on July 28, 1914, established himself in Tennessee. On February 20, 1915, he filed a petition in the Probate Court of Shelby County, Tennessee, for an inquiry whether he was a lunatic, upon the same day obtained a verdict declaring him of sound mind and on February 23 a decree to this same effect, which also declared him entitled to settlement from all persons having control of any part of his estate 'any disability by reason of the proceedings against him ... hereinbefore mentioned [i. e. the Louisiana interdict] being hereby removed.' Armed with this Gasquet brought the bill in the present case and contends that due faith and credit were denied to the Tennessee decree when the bill was dismissed, as it was. (D. C.) 235 Fed. 997.\n Ordinarily, at least, a decree in rem is conclusive as to the facts that it establishes only as against parties entitled to be heard. The Mary, 9 Cranch, 126, 146; Tilt v. Kelsey, \n207 \nU.S. 43, 52\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 1; Manson v. Williams, \n213 U.S. 453\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 519. It may be argued that if the defendant was entitled to be \n\n[247 U.S. 16, 18]\n\u00a0\n heard he was entitled to notice of some kind, which of course he did not receive in a proceeding that was tried on the day when it was begun, and that if he was not entitled to be heard he is not bound outside the limits of Tennessee. But we are not called upon to consider whether this and other arguments are sound that would need consideration before the plaintiff could prevail in this case, because in our opinion the decree was right for the reason given by the district judge. It may be called a matter of form rather than of substance; upon that we are not curious to inquire. It is enough that the reason seems to us sufficient. Article 420 of the Civil Code of Louisiana provides that a 'person interdicted cannot resume the exercise of his rights, until after the definitive judgment by which the repeal of the interdiction is pronounced'; and article 421, that 'interdiction can only be revoked by the same solemnities which were observed in pronouncing it.' Whatever may be the conclusiveness of the Tennessee decree it cannot operate upon the interdiction directly. At most it can only furnish ground for a conclusive right to have the interdiction removed. When the State laws, as a condition for the final settlement of a probate decree require either the revocation of the interdict or the appointment of a curator one or the other thing must be done. It is not enough for the party to show that he has a right to have one of them done.\n It is said that the appellant may have his right determined by the Court of the United States, under the decision in Waterman v. Canal- Louisiana Bank & Trust Co., \n215 U.S. 33\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 10. But the short answer is that all that could be determined in the District Court is admitted and never has been in dispute. The only obstacle in the way of giving the plaintiff his share is the obstacle in the way of a final account and settlement, which must take place in the Probate Court. By the law of Louisiana they cannot be had until either a curator is appointed or the in- \n\n[247 U.S. 16, 19]\n\u00a0\n terdiction removed. Assuming that the plaintiff has every other right that he says, he cannot pursue his rights across country but must proceed along the road that Louisiana law provides.\n Decree affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGENERAL RY.

Gen., of Richmond, Va., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error seeks reversal of a judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia (118 Va. 301, 87 S. E. 598) which affirmed an order of the Corporation Commission imposing a fine upon it for doing business within the state without first obtaining proper authority. \n\n[246 U.S. 500, 509]\n\u00a0\n The essential facts concerning business done as found by the Commission and approved by Supreme Court are these:\n'The defendant is a corporation of the state of New York, having an authorized capital of $5,000,000. Its principal office and factory is at Rochester, N. Y., where it owns and operates a large manufacturing plant devoted to the manufacture of materials chiefly used in the construction of railway signals which it sells and constructs all over the world. It has a branch factory at Montreal, Canada, and maintains branch offices in New York City, Chicago, and San Francisco.\n\n'By contract dated the 5th day of May, 1914, with the Southern Railway Company, the defendant agreed to furnish certain materials, supplies, machinery, devices and equipment, as well as all necessary labor, and to install, erect, and put in place certain signals and apparatus shown on the plans described in the specifications, from Amherst to Whittles, Virginia, fifty-eight miles, and to 'complete the entire system and turn same over to the railway company as a finished job,' subject to inspection and acceptance, for $85,597. Similar contracts had been previously made and fully performed, one dated September 6, 1911, covering the lines of the Southern Railway in Virginia from Monroe to Montview, Virginia, 13 miles, for $16,015, and one dated July 18, 1913, from Orange to Seminary, Virginia, 76 miles, for $112,428. The aggregate distance in this state covered by these contracts being 147 miles, and the total consideration being $ 214,040.\n\n'The purpose of these signals is to promote safety of railway operation and they operate automatically.\n\n'In order to construct these signals as reuired by the contract it was necessary to employ in this state labor, skilled and unskilled, to dig ditches in which conduits for the wires are placed, to construct concrete foundations, \n\n[246 U.S. 500, 510]\n\u00a0\n and to paint the completed structures. The completed structures are along the side of the railway track, about 2 miles apart, and are 22 or 23 feet high. In the language of the witness, Moffett: 'It is necessary to erect the signal mechanism, the masts supporting the mechanism, the houses for protecting the relays, reactors, reactants and other similar electrical devices protected from the weather, then the transformers, high tension line arresters and low tension line arrestors.' The completed structures are permanently attached to the freehold upon concrete bases.'\n\n We think the recited facts clearly show local business separate and distinct from interstate commerce within the doctrine announced and applied in Browning v. Waycross, \n233 U.S. 16\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 578.\n It is further insisted that as the amount of prescribed entrance fee is based upon maximum capital stock it constitutes a burden on interstate commerce, contrary to the Federal Constitution.\n Section 38a, c. 53, Acts of Virginia 1910 (copied in margin),1 requires every foreign corporation with capital \n\n[246 U.S. 500, 511]\n\u00a0\n over one million and not exceeding ten million dollars when it obtains a certificate of authority to do local business to pay a fee of one thousand dollars. Inspection of the statute shows that prescribed fees do not vary in direct proportion to capital stock and that a maximum is fixed. In the class to which plaintiff in error belongs the amount specified is one thousand dollars and, under all the circumstances, we cannot say this is wholly arbitrary or unreasonable.\n Considering what we said in Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 U.S. 68\n, 34 sup. Ct. 15; St. Louis S. W. Ry. v. Arkansas, \n235 U.S. 350\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 99, 59 L. E.d 265; Kansas City Ry. v. kansas, \n240 U.S. 227\n, 36 Sup.

It seems proper, however, to add that the case is on the border line. See Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 U.S. 178\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 85, 62 L. Ed. --, International Paper Co. v.

Flannery and Frederic D. McKenney, both of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.\n This is a suit brought by the petitioner to recover indemnity for a judgment that it had to pay in pursuance of the decision of this court in George A. Fuller Co. v. McCloskey, \n228 U.S. 194\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 471. McCloskey, the plaintiff in the former suit, was injured upon an elevator through the negligence of Locke, the man in charge of it. He was at work for the Mackay Company, which was doing some painting under a subcontract with the defendant, the present petitioner, which, it was held, as between the parties then concerned, made the defendant answerable for Locke. The petitioner had constructed an office building under an agreement with the owner, Hibbs. The Otis Elevator Company had put in the elevators, also under an agreement with Hibbs, and furnished the man Locke upon a somewhat vague understanding with the petitioner, which, the latter contends, left Locke the servant of the Elevator Company as between the parties now before this court. If the petitioner is \n\n[245 U.S. 489, 491]\n\u00a0\n right and the primary duty rested on the Elevator Company it may recover in the present suit, unless the former proceedings constitute a bar. Washington Gas Light Co. v. District of Columbia, \n161 \nU.S. 316, 328\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 564.\n There was evidence fully sufficient to show that the respondent retained its control at the time of the accident, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, but the judgment was set aside by the Court of Appeals on the ground that although the former judgment did not make the matter res judicata it concluded the case:\n'In view of the adjudicated facts which were not open to the consideration of a second jury there was no such primary liability on the part of the Otis Company as will support an action for indemnity.'\n\n But there were no facts, whether adjudicated in the former case or not, that were not open to the consideration of the jury in this. The Otis Company was joined as a party defendant, it is true, in the former action, and a verdict was directed in its favor. But even if the former verdict against the petitioner had gone on the same issue that was tried in the present case, which was not the fact, it could not have concluded the petitioner in favor of the Otis Company, for the reason, if for no other, that the Otis Company was dismissed from the suit before the petitioner's evidence was heard.\n The former judgment did not decide that the evidence in the present case showed as matter of law that Locke, who was in the general service of the Otis Company, was transferred for the moment to the petitioner. It did decide as matter of law that as between the Mackay Company and the petitioner their agreement left the petitioner responsible. It had no occasion to decide and did not purport to decide more. Even if it had gone farther it would have been res inter alios as an adjudication and it would not have been a precedent because the evidence in the present case had additional details which, if meagre, \n\n[245 U.S. 489, 492]\n\u00a0\n still made it impossible to say as matter of law that the Otis Company did not retain control.\n It is objected to the writ of certiorari in this case that there was no final judgment; but the writ when issued to the Court of Appeals is not limited to cases in which final judgment has been entered, but only to cases in which the judgment when entered is final.

SCOTT(1918)\nNo. 334\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 126, 127]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry M. Hoyt, 2d, of Reno, Nev., for Goldfield Co.\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, of Washington, D. C., for Scott, Collector.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here upon certificate from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, from which it appears that the Goldfield Consolidated Mines Company brought an action against Scott, United States Collector of Internal Revenue, Fourth California District, to recover certain taxes levied for the years 1909 and 1910 under the Corporation Tax Act of 1909. The District Court sustained a demurrer to the complaint, and entered judgment against the present plaintiff in error.\n In the certificate the Circuit Court of Appeals sets out the allegations of the complaint as to the first cause of action, stating that the second cause of action need not be repeated as the facts are of the same character as those set out in the first. Omitting formal and unnecessary matters the Circuit Court of Appeals certifies as the allegations of the complaint, to which the demurrer was sustained, the following:\n'The plaintiff below, and plaintiff in error herein, the Goldfield Consolidated Mines Company, is and was a corporation engaged in mining in the State of Nevada, which State is within the jurisdiction of the Fourth Internal Revenue District of California. \n\n[247 U.S. 126, 128]\n\u00a0\n 'An assessment of an excise tax under section 38 of the Act of Congress approved August 5, 1909 entitled 'An Act to provide revenue, equalize duties, and encourage the industries of the United States, and for other purposes,' was levied upon the plaintiff in error by the then Collector of Internal Revenue for the said District amounting to $41,890.91, upon an assessment of $4,189,091.61 which tax was paid under protest of the levy and assessment. The plaintiff in error had made a return of annual net income for that year, 1909, claiming a deduction for the value of the ore in the ground before it was mined, of 230,463 tons of ore, of the value in the ground before it was mined, of $5,646,940.46, upon the ground that such ore constituted exhaustion of the capital value of the property owned by it, and its protest against the assessment and levy was based thereon. Thereafter, the plaintiff in error made application for refund of said tax pursuant to sections 3220 and 3226 of the Revised Statutes [Comp. St. 1916,  5944, 5949] and based its claim to such refund upon the propriety of the deduction so claimed, and stated in said application that such exhaustion of capital assets constituted a depreciation within the meaning of the act in question, and that the same would have more than offset the total net income of the plaintiff in error.\n\n'Thereafter, during the pendency before the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of said application for refund, the plaintiff in error, by its duly authorized officials, made full explanation before the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and offered full proof of the correctness in all respects of its said return of annual net income for the year 1909 and of all statements of fact contained therein, and while the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was holding said application under consideration, the plaintiff in error was duly and regularly granted by said Commissioner, leave to comply fully with the then rules and regulations of the Treasury Department embodied in \n\n[247 U.S. 126, 129]\n\u00a0\n Treasu y Decision 1675 promulgated February 14th, 1911, and particularly sections 80 to 89 thereof relating to depreciation of property of corporations whose business involved wasting assets, and like leave was so given to present to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, an amended statement and return of annual net income for said year with explanations of fact in support thereof, and to ascertain the unit cost per ton of the estimated ore bodies belonging to the plaintiff in its various mining properties as of January 1st, 1909, and the estimated value of the ore in the ground before it was mined for the year 1909, by multiplying the said unit cost per ton by the total number of tons mined in said year, all of which was done, and the same was filed by the plaintiff in error during the time so provided.' The rules and regulations are then set out.\n\n ...\n'In addition to the rules and regulations as above set out, the plaintiff in error was further required by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to make a calculation for the year 1909 and of previous years of operation, to ascertain the total exhaustion of ore which had taken place in the operation of its mining properties, and to enter such amount of tonnage exhaustion, multiplied by the unit cost per ton, in its official corporate books of account, and also cause the same to be included in its printed annual report of that current year to its stockholders and the public with appropriate explanation thereof, all of which requirements were performed by the plaintiff in error in obedience to said orders of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and within the time granted therefor.\n\n'The complaint alleged that the resulting figures so rendered in said return were and are in all respects true and correct, and resulted in a showing of net income measuring the excise tax under the rules and regulations \n\n[247 U.S. 126, 130]\n\u00a0\n amounting to $765,380.02 upon which the tax would have been $7,653.80; it also appeared from said complaint that this compliance with the requirements of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was made by the plaintiff in error without waiving its claim to the full deduction originally claimed.\n\n'It further appears from the complaint, that in disobedience and disregard of the law and of the rules and regulations of the Treasury Department, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the application for refund of the plaintiff in error in toto, which disallowance was communicated to the plaintiff in error December 29, 1913, by the defendant in error, Collector of Internal Revenue, the then collector having succeeded to the office of the Collector of Internal Revenue who had originally levied the tax in question. The complaint alleges that no part of the said tax has been refunded or paid back, and that the same is still due and unpaid.'\n\n The questions propounded are:\n\n 1. \nUnder the provisions of paragraph 38 of the Act of Congress entitled: 'An Act to provide revenue, equalize duties, and encourage the industries of the United States, and for other purposes,' approved August 5, 1909, (36 Statutes at Large, p. 11, at p. 112), is a mining corporation, for the purpose of determining its net income for the basis of taxation, entitled to deduct from its gross income any amount whatever on account of depletion or exhaustion of ore bodies caused by its operations for the year for which the tax is assessed?\n\n 2. \nIs such a corporation under said act, entitled in the ascertainment of its net income, to a deduction against gross proceeds from the mining and treatment of ores to the extent of the cost value of the ore in the ground before it was mined, ascertained in strict compliance with the rules and regulations of the Treasury Department of February 14, 1911 (Tr. Dec. 1675)? \n\n[247 U.S. 126, 131]\n\u00a0\n 3. Where such a corporation claimed originally in its return of net income under said act a deduction for depreciation from exhaustion of ore for the year equal to the actual value of the ore in the ground before it was mined, and having been denied any deduc ion whatever for exhaustion of ore, and having been assessed accordingly and having paid the resulting tax, made application pursuant to sections 3220 and 3226, Revised Statutes for refund, during the pendency of which application said corporation was granted leave to amend and did amend its return of net income in strict accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated February 14, 1911, sections 80 to 89 T. D. 1675, resulting in an amended return based upon cost as provided in said regulations and showing claimed deductions therefrom less than the corporation's net realizations for the year from the ore actually mined, is such corporation entitled to an allowance of deductions and refund of taxes accordingly?\n\n 4. \nIn what, if any, way is the right to such claimed deductions affected by the fact that such corporation, in obedience to requirements imposed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue at the time of filing its amended returns showing the cost value as of January 1, 1909, of the ores mined during the year, caused to be entered in its official books of account and printed in its annual report of that current year to all of its stockholders and to the public, a statement of the total amount of ore exhaustions, multiplied by the unit cost per ton on its mining properties for that and all previous years?\n In the brief submitted for the Goldfield Consolidated Mines Company counsel frankly admit that if this court is to adhere to the principles laid down in Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 U.S. 399\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 136, and Von Baumbach, Collector, v. Sargent Land Company, \n242 U.S. 503\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 201, those cases are conclusive against the contentions of the Mines Company in this proceeding. In view of the discussion of the nature \n\n[247 U.S. 126, 132]\n\u00a0\n of mining property in Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, supra, and the application of the principles therein laid down in the subsequent cases of Stanton v. Baltic Mining Company, \n240 U.S. 103\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 278, and Von Baumbach, Collector, v. Sargent Land Company, supra, it is unnecessary to enter upon further consideration of the matters disposed of in those cases. We find no occasion to depart from the principles therein announced, or the rulings therein made. They have been reaffirmed in the case of United States v. Biwabik Mining Company, \n247 U.S. 116\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 462, 62 L. Ed. --, just decided. In this view it follows that the first and second questions must be answered in the negative, and that it is unnecessary to answer the third and fourth questions.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGOLDMAN v. U S(1918)\nNo. 702\nArgued: Decided: January 14, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Harry Weinberger, of New York City, for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, of Washington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[245 U.S. 474, 475]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Because of the constitutional questions involved the plaintiffs in error prosecute this direct writ of error to reverse a criminal conviction and resulting sentence imposed upon them. The indictment upon which the conviction was had charged them with having, in violation of sections 37 and 332 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St. 1916,  10201, 10506), unlawfully conspired together and with others unknown to induce persons who by the Selective Draft Law of May 18, 1917, (Public No. 12, 65th Congress, c. 15, 40 Stat. 76) were under the duty to register, to disobey the law by failing to register. Five specified overt acts were in the indictment charged to have been committed in furtherance of the alleged illegal conspiracy.\n Seven grounds of error were assigned at the time of the allowance of the writ: (1) The refusal of the court at the request of the defendants to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the formation of a conspiracy to induce persons not to register as they were required under the law to do and the performance of overt acts to carry out the conspiracy constituted no offense. (2) The action of the court in refusing to grant a motion in arrest of judgment on the same ground. (3) The refusal to set aside the verdict because the facts proved did not constitute an offense against the United States. (4) The denial of a motion to dismiss the prosecution at the request of the defendants on the ground that the Selective Draft Law upon which the alleged duty to register depended was repugnant to the Consitution and void, there being numerous specifications on this subject involving a challenge of all power in Congress to have enacted the law and moreover upon the assumption of some power an assertion of the repugnancy of the statute to the Constitution resulting from various provisions which the act contained. (5) The de- \n\n[245 U.S. 474, 476]\n\u00a0\n nial by the court of a motion made at the close of the case to dismiss the indictment on the ground that it stated no offense as previously insisted and upon the further ground that in any event there was no proof of the alleged conspiracy or the averred overt acts or of any act adequate to show guilt. (6 and 7) The refusal of a motion to set aside the verdict and in arrest of judgment because the verdict was contrary to law and unsupported by evidence upon grounds which had been previously urged and overruled.\n Putting aside the multiplication which results from urging the same ground several times because when once made it was adhered to and reiterated at different stages of the trial, it is clear that the assignments embrace only three propositions: (1) The failure to dismiss th prosecution because of the repugnancy of the Selective Draft Law to the Constitution for the reasons relied upon. (2) The refusal to dismiss because the indictment stated no offense. (3) The refusal to dismiss because there was no proof of conspiracy or of any overt acts adequate to have justified the submission of the case to the jury. Indeed in the elaborate argument at bar all the assignments of error are treated as embraced under the propositions thus stated and we therefore come to dispose of the case from such point of view.\n\n 1. \nThe grounds here made the basis of the charge that the Selective Draft Law is repugnant to the Constitution are so far as they concern the question of registration provided for by that law, identical with those which were urged in Arver v. United States, \n245 U.S. 366\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 159, 62 L. Ed. --, and were there adversely disposed of. The ruling in that case therefore also adversely disposes of all the relevant constitutional questions in this. The duty nevertheless remains to consider the other questions. Brolan v. United States, \n236 U.S. 216\n-218, 35 Sup. Ct. 285.\n\n 2. \nThe contention that the indictment stated no of- \n\n[245 U.S. 474, 477]\n\u00a0\n fense proceeds upon the assumption reiterated in various forms of statement that no crime results from an unlawful conspiracy to bring about an illegal act joined with the doing of overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy unless the conspiracy has accomplished its unlawful purpose by causing the illegal act to be committed. This, however, but disregards the settled doctrine that an unlawful conspiracy under section 37 of the Criminal Code to bring about an illegal act and the doing of overt acts in furtherance of such conspiracy is in and of itself inherently and substantively a crime punishable as such irrespective of whether the result of the conspiracy has been to accomplish its illegal end. United States v. Rabinowich, \n238 \nU.S. 78, 85\n, 86 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 682, and authorities there cited.\n\n 3. \nSifting out of the arguments advanced to support the proposition that there was no evidence whatever tending to show guilt, contentions based upon the misconception as to the law of conspiracy which we have just adversely disposed of, and, moreover, contentions concerning an asserted misuse of discretion by the court below in ruling on an application to postpone the trial, which as we have seen, were not even remotely referred to in the assignments of error, we think all the arguments rest upon the assumption that the power to review embraces the right to invade the province of the jury by determining questions of credibility and weight of evidence and from the residuum of evidence resulting from indulging in and applying the results of such erroneous assumption drawing the conclusion as to no evidence relied upon. While this statement suffices to dispose of the case without going further, we nevertheless say without recapitulating evidence that after a review of the whole record we think the proposition that there was no evidence whatever of guilt to go to the jury is absolutely devoid of merit.\n It follows that the judgment below must be and it is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT NORTHERN R. CO. v. ALEXANDER(1918)\nNo. 130\nArgued: January 15, 1918Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 276, 277]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. I. Parker Veazey, Jr., of Great Falls, Mont., and E. C. Lindley, of St. Paul, Minn., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Cornelius B. Nolan, of Helena, Mont., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents for decision the question whether the nonremovable case stated in the complaint became one subject to removal when the plaintiff rested his case, and, as the defendant claimed, it became apparent that the allegation of the complaint that the deceased was employed in interstate commerce when killed was not sustained by the evidence.\n We shall designate the parties as they were in the trial court, the defendant in error as plaintiff and the plaintiff in error as defendant.\n The suit was commenced in a district court of Montana and is one to recover damages for wrongful death. The plaintiff was a citizen of Montana when the case was commenced and he alleges in his complaint that the defendant was an interstate carrier, organized under the laws of the state of Minnesota at the time the accident occurred; that the deceased was a conductor employed by \n\n[246 U.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n the defendant in interstate commerce at the time he was killed; and that the proximate cause of the accident was the failure of defendant to fence its line, which resulted in the derailing of the car on which plaintiff's decedent was employed, causing his instant death.\n The defense is a denial that deceased was employed in interstate commerce when injured, and a denial of negligence in the failure to fence, with a plea of assumption of risk.\n When the plaintiff rested his case the defendant 'moved for a judgment of nonsuit and dismissal upon the merits, ... based upon the complaint of the plaintiff and upon the testimony adduced.'\n This motion asserted in various forms that the evidence introduced failed to show any actionable negligence on the part of the defendant and concluded with a fifth paragraph, alleging, in substance, as follows:\n That there was a fatal variance, amounting to failure of proof, between the allegation of the complaint that the deceased was employed in interstate commerce at the time he was injured and the evidence introduced; ... that, this variance is substantial in that with the complaint charging that the deceased was killed while engaged in interstate commerce, the defendant could not remove said case to the federal court, whereas if the case as made by the proof had been made, to wit, an intrastate case, it could have been removed; and hence the failure to recognize the variance would operate to deny to the defendant a right under a statute or law of the United States, to wit, the right to remove such a case properly pleaded to the federal court.\n The trial court having overruled this motion, the defendant introduced its evidence in defense and after the plaintiff's rebuttal was concluded renewed its motion, which was again denied, the defendant reserving its exception, and thereupon the case was submitted to the jury \n\n[246 U.S. 276, 279]\n\u00a0\n and judgment was entered on the verdict in favor of the plaintiff.\n On review the Supreme Court of Montana (51 Mont. 565, 154 Pac. 914) held that the trial court had erred, and should have ruled that on the evidence adduced the deceased was not employed in interstate commerce when injured, but holding that the defendant had waived its right to remove by failing to file a petition for removal, as required by law, the court went forward and held, that a case of negligence at common law was stated in the complaint, and that the evidence introduced justified the trial court in submitting the case to the jury, and that the judgment must be affirmed.\n In disposing of the question presented by this motion for 'nonsuit and dismissal' which we are considering, the Supreme Court of Montana said:\n'We recall but one respect in which a defendant can be seriously prejudiced in such a situation, and that is where, by reason of diverse citizenship, removal of the cause to the federal court might be in order. In such a situation, however, the defendant must assert its right, under penalty of waiver, by filing a petition to remove at the first opportunity. ... This the appellant did not do; instead, and with the knowledge of its right to have the cause removed, it submitted to the jurisdiction of the state court in which the trial occurred, by seeking a dismissal for variance as well as for failure to show the breach by it of any legal duty to the decedent under either state or federal law.'\n\n No claim is made that the allegation that the plaintiff's decedent was employed in interstate commerce was incorporated into the complaint fraudulently or in bad faith, for the purpose of defeating the right of the defendant to remove the case to the federal court.\n The claim now m de in this court by the defendant is that the state Supreme Court correctly held that the evidence introduced failed to show that the deceased was \n\n[246 U.S. 276, 280]\n\u00a0\n employed in interstate commerce when he was injured, but that it committed reversible error and denied to the defendant the federal right to remove the case when it held that the right to remove had been waived, and affirmed the judgment instead of reversing and remanding the case to the lower court for further proceedings.\n The plaintiff replies to this claim with the contention that the court is without jurisdiction to review the decision of the state Supreme Court for the reason that no federal right was denied to the plaintiff in error at any stage of the proceeding in the state court.\n It is, of course, familiar law that the right of removal being statutory, a suit commenced in a state court must remain there until cause is shown for its transfer under some act of Congress. Gold Washing, etc., Co. v. Keyes, \n96 U.S. 199\n; Jud. Code, c. 3,  28, 39.\n The allegation of the complaint that the deceased was employed in interstate commerce when injured, brought the case within the scope of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (Act April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 [ Comp. St. 1916,  8657-8665]) and it would have been removable either for diversity of citizenship or as a case arising under a law of the United States, except for the prohibition against removal contained in the amendment to the act, approved April 5, 1910 (36 Stat. L. 291, c. 143). But this allegation rendered the case, at the time it was commenced, clearly not removable on either ground. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Leslie, \n238 U.S. 599\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 844; Southern R. R. Co. v. Lloyd, \n239 U.S. 496\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 210.\n The removal provisions of the Judicial Code (chapter 3,  28 and 39, inclusive; Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1094, 1099 [Comp. St. 1916 ,  1010, 1021]), in effect when this case was tried, were substantially the same as they have been since the Removal Act of 1888 was passed, and that a case not removable when commenced may afterwards become removable is settled by Ayers v. Watson, \n113 U.S. 594\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 641; Martin's Administrator v. B. & O. R. R. Co., \n151 \nU.S. 673, 688\n, 691 S., 14 Sup. Ct. 533; Powers v. C. & O. Ry.

Under the doctrine of these cases the defendant, admitting the nonremovable character of the case at bar when it was commenced, argues that the failure of the plaintiff to prove his allegation that the deceased was employed in interstate commerce when he was injured, left the complaint as if the allegation had not been incorporated into it, and that therefore the case became removable for diversity of citizenship when the plaintiff rested his case.\n But unfortunately for the validity of this contention it has been frequently decided by this court that whether a case arising, as this one does, under a law of the United States is removable or not, when it is commenced (there being no claim of fraudulent attempt to evade removal), is to be determined by the allegations of the complaint or petition and that if the case is not then removable it cannot be made removable by any statement in the petition for removal or in subsequent pleadings by the defendant. Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, \n152 U.S. 454\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 654; Chappell v. Waterworth, \n155 U.S. 102\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 34; Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Cody, \n166 U.S. 606\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 703; Taylor v. Anderson, \n234 U.S. 74\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 724\n\n\n It is also settled that a case, arising under the laws of the United States, nonremovable on the complaint, when commenced, cannot be converted into a removable one by evidence of the defendant or by an order of the court upon any issue tried upon the merits, but that suc conversion can only be accomplished by the voluntary amendment of his pleadings by the plaintiff or, where the case is not removable because of joinder of defendants, by the voluntary dismissal or nonsuit by him of a party or of parties defendant.

Interior Construction Co., \n215 U.S. 246\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 76; American Car, etc., Co. v. Kettlehake, \n236 U.S. 311\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 355. \n\n[246 U.S. 276, 282]\n\u00a0\n The obvious principle of these decisions is that, in the absence of a fraudulent purpose to defeat removal, the plaintiff may by the allegations of his complaint determine the status with respect to removability of a case, arising under a law of the United States, when it is commenced, and that this power to determine the removability of his case continues with the plaintiff throughout the litigation, so that whether such a case nonremovable when commenced shall afterwards become removable depends not upon what the defendant may allege or prove or what the court may, after hearing upon the merits, in invitum, order, but solely upon the form which the plaintiff by his voluntary action shall give to the pleadings in the case as it progresses towards a conclusion.\n The result of the application of this principle to the case at bar is not doubtful.\n The plaintiff did not at any time admit that he had failed to prove the allegation that the deceased was employed in interstate commerce when injured, and he did not amend his complaint, but, on the contrary, he has contended at every stage of the case and in his brief in this court still contends that the allegation was supported by the evidence. The first holding to the contrary was by the state Supreme Court and the most that can be said of that decision is that the defendant prevailed in a matter of defense which he had pleaded, but, as we have seen, this does not convert a nonremovable case into a removable one, in the absence of voluntary action on the part of the plaintiff, and it therefore results that the defendant did not at any time have the right to remove the case to the federal court, which it claims was denied to it, and that therefore, there being no substance in the claim of denial of federal right, this court is without jurisdiction to review the decision of the Supreme Court of Montana and the writ of error must be\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT NORTHERN RY.

Lindley, of St. Paul, Minn., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. James McCabe, of Seattle, Wash., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the court.\n Adaline Donaldson, as administratrix of the estate of Vance H. Thoms, deceased, brought suit in the superior court of Snohomish county, Wash., under the federal Employers' Liability Act (Act April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 [Comp.  . 1916,  8657-8665]), to recover damages for injuries received which resulted in the death of Vance H. Thoms, by reason of a boiler explosion upon one of the defendant's engines upon which decedent was employed as an engineer.\n The charges of negligence, in the amended complaint alleged to have resulted in the injury and death of the decedent were: That the boiler on the engine was insufficient in that:\n\n 1. \nThe button heads of the crown bolts of the boiler were excessively and unnecessarily large and consequently unduly exposed to the direct heat produced by the oil fuel used on the locomotive;\n\n 2. \nThat the boiler was not provided with fusible safety plugs;- \n\n[246 U.S. 121, 123]\n\u00a0\n 3. That scale was negligently allowed by defendant company, its officers and employes, to accumulate upon the crown sheet in the boiler.\n The answer of the company denied negligence, and specifically set up the defense of contributory negligence and assumed risk on the part of the deceased. In the trial court the plaintiff recovered a verdict and judgment, and the judgment was affirmed in the Supreme Court of the state of Washington. 89 Wash. 161, 154 Pac. 133.\n The ground of reversal principally urged here is that the testimony did not warrant a recovery by the plaintiff, and when properly considered required an instruction to the jury to find a verdict in favor of the company.\n An examination of the record discloses that there was testimony tending to support the allegations of negligence set forth in the amended complaint. That the engine upon which the deceased was working had been a coal-burning engine but that at the time of the explosion the fuel used in its operation was, and for some time had been, oil. That the button heads on the bolts of the crown sheet at the top of the fire box (this sheet also formed the bottom of the water compartment over the fire box) were large ones when the engine was fired with coal, and were not changed with the change of fuel from coal to oil. That these button heads because of their size became overheated when oil was used for fuel, resulting in the deterioration and weakening of the strength of their material, and from the consequent giving away of the button heads, the crown sheet came down and the explosion resulted. There is also testimony tending to show that there was an accumulation of scale and a want of use of fusible plugs.\n On the part of the company there was testimony tending to meet and refute that introduced by the plaintiff, and a considerable amount of testimony was introduced tending to show that the water in the boiler was too low, \n\n[246 U.S. 121, 124]\n\u00a0\n thereby causing the explosion from the fault of the deceased engineer in allowing it to become so. There was testimony for the plaintiff to the effect that the water was not too low at the time of the explosion. The trial court submitted these issues to the jury, with the result that a verdict was found in favor of the plaintiff. The circuit court held that there was evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict, and refused to disturb it. The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed the judgment. In this situation it is enough to say that it is not the province of this court to weigh conflicting evidence. The record shows testimony supporting the verdict, and that is as far as this court enters upon a consideration of that question.\n Complaint is made that the trial court failed to give an instruction requested by the company as to assumption of risk, and as to the effect of the federal Boiler Inspection Act.\n Section 4 of the federal Employers' Liability Act (35 Stat. 65) provides:\n'That in any action brought against any common carrier under or by virtue of any of the provisions of this act to recover damages for injuries to, or the death of, any of its employes such employe shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment in any case where the violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employes contributed to the injury or death of such employe.' Comp. St. 1916,  8660\n\n\n\n That the federal Boiler Inspection Act was enacted for the safety of employes is obvious. Section 2 of that act (Act Feb. 17, 1911, c. 103, 36 Stat. 913 [8 U. S. Comp. Stats. 1916,  8631]) provides:\n'That from and after the first day of July, nineteen hundred and eleven, it shall be unlawful for any common carrier, its officers or agents, subject to this act to use any locomotive engine propelled by steam power in moving interstate or foreign traffic unless the boiler of said locomotive \n\n[246 U.S. 121, 125]\n\u00a0\n and appurtenances thereof are in proper condition and safe to operate in the service to which the same is put, that the same may be employed in the active service of such carrier in moving traffic without unnecessary peril to life or limb, and all boilers shall be inspected from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this act, and be able to withstand such test or tests as may be prescribed in the rules and regulations hereinafter provided for.'\n\n Counsel for the company at the trial upon assumed risk requested the following charge:\n'You are instructed that even where an employer, such as a railroad company, is negligent in the construction or maintenance of its tools or equipment, such as a locomotive, yet an employe who accepts, or continues his employment, knowing of the existence of such defects or negligence, and knowing the danger therefrom, assumes the risk of the injury to himself from such defects and cannot recover if he is injured as a result of them. This would not be true in the present case, if the negligence or defects involved some violation of a United States statute, but there is no evidence of any violation of such a statute in this action, so that the rule which I have just given to you would apply in this case. Therefore, even if you find that the defendant company had been negligent in adopting an improper type of bolt, or in failing to install fusible plugs, or in some other particular in the construction or maintenance of this boiler, and even though you should also find that such negligence caused the explosion, still, the plaintiff cannot recover in this action, if you should also find that the deceased, V. H. Thoms, was familiar with the type of construction used, or the particular form of negligence involved, and knew the danger likely to arise therefrom, or if, in the exercise of a reasonable care, he should have known of these things prior to the time of his injury.'- \n\n[246 U.S. 121, 126]\n\u00a0\n\n\n But the court charged upon this subject:\n'You are instructed that the law provides that it shall be unlawful for any common carrier, as was the defendant, engaged in interstate commerce, to use any locomotive engine propelled by steam power, unless the boiler of the locomotive and appurtenances thereof are in proper condition and safe to operate in the service to which the same is put, that the same may be employed in the active service of said carrier in moving traffic, without unnecessary peril to life and limb; and that no employe shall be deemed to have assumed any risk of death by reason of any locomotive engine operated in violation of said law, and that no employe injured or killed by reason of a locomotive engine operated in violation of said law shall be held to have been guilty of contributory negligence.\n\n'Therefore, if you shall believe, from a fair preponderance of all the evidence in the case, that the boiler of the locomotive engine No. 1902 or the appurtenances thereof were not in proper condition and safe to operate in the active service of the defendant in moving traffic without unnecessary peril to life or limb, by reason of the negligence of the defendant, in any one or more of the three respects alleged in the complaint, then and in that case Vance H. Thoms assumed no risk of death and was guilty of no contributory negligence, and the affirmative defenses must fail.\n\n'However, if such boiler and appurtenances were in proper condition and safe for such use in moving traffic, but due to defendant's negligence were defective i one or more of the respects alleged in the complaint and Vance H. Thoms had actual knowledge of such defect or defects, or such defects were so plainly observable that in the reasonable exercise of his faculties he should have known of such and may be presumed to have known thereof and the dangers that surrounded him then Vance \n\n[246 U.S. 121, 127]\n\u00a0\n H. Thoms assumed the risks of injury and the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.'\n\n The charge requested is inconsistent with the provisions of section 4 of the federal Employers' Liability Act and section 2 of the Boiler Inspection Act. As given it is enough to say that it is more favorable to the company than the law requires. See Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. Proffitt, \n241 \nU.S. 462, 468\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 620.\n The further contention is that the effect of this charge was to leave to the jury to determine the type of boiler construction, in respect to the use of the large button heads which are alleged to have made the engine unsafe to operate. And it is contended that there is testimony tending to show that the use of either the large or small kind of button heads was approved by the federal department of boiler inspection. Attention is directed to the testimony of an expert witness, offered by the defendant for the purpose of showing that low water was the cause of the explosion, in which he spoke of the use of the button heads of the larger and also of the smaller or taperhead kind, and was asked whether the United States government made certain requirements as to how boilers and engines should be constructed, to which he answered:\n'No. Not as long as we have the proper factor of safety. ... They have a factor of safety, and the factor of safety is five on the shell of the boilers; that is if we have a 200-pound pressure boiler it should stand up to a test of 1,000 pounds; five to one.'\n\n Asked whether the government inspects engines and locomotives in general, he answered, 'Yes, by the United States inspector.' and that there was a standard to which locomotives must be built in order to pass inspection. Asked as to the type of the crown bolt permitted, he answered that either type is acceptable when properly applied. It is evident that this testimony, whatever might be its effect, is far from showing an approval by governmentinspectors \n\n[246 U.S. 121, 128]\n\u00a0\n of the use of the large type of button head upon an oil-burning engine.\n Nor can we agree with the contention of the plaintiff in error that so long as the large button head had not been disapproved by the government inspector such fact is conclusive of the sufficiency of the type in use. We find nothing in the Boiler Inspection Act to warrant the conclusion that there is no liability for an unsafe locomotive, in view of the provisions of section 2 of the act, because some particular feature of construction, which has been found unsafe has not been disapproved by the federal boiler inspector.\n Other errors are assigned, so far as they are open here we have examined these assignments and find in none of them reason for the reversal of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington, and that judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT NORTHERN RY. CO. v. STATE OF MINN. EX REL. VILLAGE OF CLARA(1918)\nNo. 185\nArgued: Decided: April 15, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 434, 435]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. C. Lindley, M. L. Countryman, and Thomas R. Benton, all of St. Paul, Minn., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. C. A. Fosnes, of Montevideo, Minn., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought to compel the railroad companies to build a sidewalk on the south side of Bunde street in the village of Clara City, Minnesota, where the right of way of the railroad companies crosses that street. The right of way of the companies is of the width of 300 feet at the place where Bunde street crosses the same. At or near the center of this right of way the companies have constructed three railroad tracks. There are business houses upon both sides of the right of way, and it becomes necessary for people to cross the same frequently.\n The case was decided in the lower court in Minnesota upon demurrer to the petition in mandamus, and the record contains this statement:\n'For the purpose of the demurrer it was admitted by relator that that part of the street in question which is occupied by the roadbed or tracks of the respondents was and is properly, securely and sufficiently planked the full width of the street, such planking extending \n\n[246 U.S. 434, 436]\n\u00a0\n the full length of the ties and between the tracks as in that particular required by statute; that the sole object and purpose sought to be attained in and by these proceedings is to compel the respondents to construct a sidewalk on one side of the street as it is located across the entire right of way, so that the sidewalk will connect with the said planking in either direction, but not so as to include in such construction the building of any sidewalk or crosswalk along that part of the street now occupied by said roadbed or tracks, which part is already sufficiently and securely planked for crossing purposes.'\n\n The general laws of Minnesota contain a provision requiring the planking of railroad crossings where the same cross a public street. Section 4256 of the General Statutes of Minnesota. By amendment of 1913 the following provision was added:\n'And a suitable sidewalk shall be constructed by said company to connect with and correspond to sidewalks constructed and installed by the municipality or by owners of abutting property, but cement or concrete construction shall not be required in track space actually occupied by the railroad ties if some substantial and suitable sidewalk material is used in lieu thereof.' Laws of Minnesota 1913, chapter 78, section 1.\n\n The lower court in Minnesota dismissed the petition, which judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, and the railroad company was required to construct the sidewalk at its own expense. 130 Minn. 480, 153 N. W. 879. The court held that the statute was a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state. The contention here made is that the statute as thus enforced denies to the companies due process of law and the equal protection of the law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution.\n It is too well settled by former decisions of this court to require extended discussion here-that railroad com- \n\n[246 U.S. 434, 437]\n\u00a0\n panies may be required by the states in the exercise of the police power to make streets and highways crossed by the tracks of such companies reasonably safe and convenient for public use, and this at their own expense. Such companies accept their franchises from the state subject to their duties to conform to regulations, not of an arbitrary nature, as to the opening and use of the public streets for the purpose of promoting the public safety and convenience. This principle was applied by this court in C., I. & W. R. Co. v. Connersville, \n218 U.S. 336\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 93, 20 Ann. Cas. 1206, wherein the railroad, because of the extension of a street through an embankment upon which the railroad was built, was required to construct at its own expense a bridge across the street. In Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Duluth, \n208 U.S. 583\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 341, it was held that a municipality of the state of Minnesota might require a railroad company to repair a viaduct constructed by the city after the opening of the railroad notwithstanding a contract relieving the railroad from making repairs thereon for a term of years, that the police power of the state was a continuing one, and could not be contracted away, and that uncompensated obedience to laws, passed in its exercise, did not contravene the federal Constitution. This case was followed with approval in St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba R. Co. v. State of Minnesota, \n214 U.S. 497\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 698. In Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Minneapolis, \n232 U.S. 430\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 400, this court affirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota requiring a railroad company to build at its own expense a bridge required in order to permit a municipality in that state to construct a canal connecting two lakes within the limits of a public park. In the opinion in that case previous decisions in this court are collected and reviewed.\n The Supreme Court of Minnesota in the instant case held that the railroad companies might be required \n\n[246 U.S. 434, 438]\n\u00a0\n construct a sidewalk upon the right of way on both sides of the planked crossing. In the opinion of the court the sidewalk, leading to the crossing, tend d to promote the safety and convenience of the public, and, after discussing the well-established authority of the state to require planking at crossings, as to the additional requirement to build the connecting sidewalk, said:\n'There can be no controlling difference between the requirement of sidewalk and of planking. Planking is, to be sure, more to prevent persons in vehicles from injury, or the vehicles or teams from damage, by being stalled on the crossing. But, where a crossing is much traveled, safety, to say nothing of convenience, may require a separate space, like a sidewalk, reserved for pedestrians. There is a peculiar peril to travelers on foot, where many vehicles pass and the attention of the drivers is diverted to looking out for trains liable to use the crossing. Again, unless a well-defined walk be provided, there is danger of pedestrians crossing the tracks at places unexpected to those in charge of trains or cars, not to mention the inconvenience where mud and impassable conditions compel those on foot to deviate from the street proper.\n\n'It is said defendant, if obligated to lay a sidewalk across its right of way, might likewise be required to construct sidewalks along such right of way where it borders a highway or street. The sufficient answer is that the statute does not call for anything of the kind.\n\n'The contention is also that defendant has so much larger right of way than it needs or occupies for its three tracks that for the greater distance the sidewalk, as a safety provision, is out of place. It is to be assumed that the right of way is such only as is needed for and devoted to railway purposes, and such as is rightfully exempt from taxes and assessments because of the payment of the gross earnings tax. Within its right of way defendant \n\n[246 U.S. 434, 439]\n\u00a0\n may at any time place additional tracks, or change the location of those it maintains, and, for that reason, it also seems proper that the safety of the passage for the traveler for the whole distance should be placed upon the railroad company. The statute merely prescribes that it shall maintain a sidewalk over its legitimate right of way to correspond and connect with the walk maintained under the supervision of the municipality, so as to afford the pedestrians a reasonably safe and convenient crossing.'\n\n This court considers a case of this nature in the light of the principle that the state is primarily the judge of regulations required in the interest of the public safety and welfare. Such statutes may only be declared unconstitutional where they are arbitrary or unreasonable attempts to exercise authority vested in the state in the public interest. We are not prepared to say that this statute is of that character, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREER v. U.S.(1918)\nNo. 504\nArgued: Decided: January 28, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. C. Denton and Frank Lee, both of Muskogee, Oki., for petitioner.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Warren, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner was tried for introducing whiskey from without the State into that part of Oklahoma that formerly was within the Indian Territory. He was convicted and sentenced to fine and imprisonment. Material error at the trial is alleged because the Court refused to instruct the jury that the defendant was presumed to be a person of good character, and that the supposed presumption should be considered as evidence in favor of the accused, with some further amplifications not necessary to be repeated. The court did instruct the jury that the de- \n\n[245 U.S. 559, 560]\n\u00a0\n fendant was presumed to be innocent of the charge until his guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the presumption followed him throughout the trial until so overcome. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the Court below. 240 Fed. 320, 153 C. C. A. 246. This judgment was in accordance with a carefully reasoned earlier decision in the same circuit, Price v. United States, 218 Fed. 149, 132 C. C. A. 1, L. R. A. 1915D, 1070, with an acute statement in United States v. Smith (D. C.) 217 Fed. 839, and with numerous state cases and text books. But as other Circuit Courts of Appeal had taken a different view, Mullen v. United States, 106 Fed. 892, 46 C. C. A. 22; Garst v. United States, 180 Fed. 339, 344, 345, 103 C. C. A. 469, also taken by other cases and text books, it becomes necessary for this Court to settle the doubt.\n Obviously the character of the defendant was a matter of fact, which, if investigated, might turn out either way. It is not established as matter of law that all persons indicted are men of good character. If it were a fact regarded as necessarily material to the main issues it would be itself issuable, and the Government would be entitled to put in evidence whether the prisoner did so or not. As the Government cannot put in evidence except to answer evidence introduced by the defence the natural inference is that the prisoner is allowed to try to prove a good character for what it may be worth, but that the choice whether to raise that issue rests with him. The rule that if he prefers not to go into the matter the Government cannot argue from it would be meaningless if there were a presumption in his favor that could not be attacked. For the failure to put on witnesses, instead of suggesting unfavorable comment, would only show the astuteness of the prisoner's counsel. The meaning must be that character is not an issue in the case unless the prisoner chooses to make it one; otherwise he would be foolish to open the \n\n[245 U.S. 559, 561]\n\u00a0\n door to contradiction by going into evidence when without it good character would be incontrovertibly presumed. Addison v. People, 193 Ill. 405, 419, 62 N. E. 235.\n Our reasoning is confirmed by the fact that the right to introduce evidence of good character seems formerly to have been regarded as a favor to prisoners, McNally, Evidence, 320, which sufficiently implies that good character was not presumed. In reason it should not be. A presumption upon a matter of fact, when it is not merely a disguise for some other principle, means that common experience shows the fact to be so generally true that courts may notice the truth. Whatever the scope of the presumption that a man is innocent of the specific crime harged, it cannot be said that by common experience the character of most people indicted by a grand jury is good.\n It is argued that the Court was bound by the rules of evidence as they stood in 1789. That those rules would not be conclusive is sufficiently shown by Rosen v. United States (January 7, 1918) \n245 U.S. 467\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 148, 62 L. Ed. --. But it is safe to believe that the supposed presumption is of later date, of American origin, and comes from overlooking the distinction between this and the presumption of innocence and from other causes not necessary to detail.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA dissents. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGRINNELL WASHING MACH CO. v. E E JOHNSON CO.(1918)\nNo. 272\nArgued: Decided: June 10, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. Melville Church, of Washington, D. C., and Ralph Orwig, of Des Moines, Iowa, for petitioner.\n Mr. Clarence E. Mehlhope, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the Grinnell Washing Machine Company against the E. E. Johnson Company for infringement of letters patent No. 950,402 granted to W. F. Phillips February 22, 1910. The patentee states the object of the invention to be 'to provide a gearing \n\n[247 U.S. 426, 427]\n\u00a0\n device of simple, durable, and inexpensive construction, especially designed for use in operating washing machines and wringers, by means of power supplied by an electric motor or other source of power.'\n The patent has been several times in litigation. In the United States District Court for the Southern District\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n of Iowa it was held valid and infringed. 209 Fed. 621. It was again sued upon in the same District Court, and upon appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit a decree holding the patent valid and infringed was sustained. 222 Fed. 512, 138 C. C. A. 112. In the case at bar the patent was sustained in the District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, where it was held valid and infringed, and a decree entered accordingly. From \n\n[247 U.S. 426, 428]\n\u00a0\n this decree an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and that court reversed the decree below, and held the patent invalid. 231 Fed. 988, 146 C. C. A. 184. A writ of certiorari brings the last-named case here.\n The gearing device, which is the subjectmatter of the Phillips patent, will sufficiently appear, reference being had to the annexed drawing and description.\n While the invention is for a gearing device, the washing machine to which it is said to be especially designed, is what is known as the 'dolly type.' As the drawing shows, in that type of machine there is a tub (10) on which is hinged a cover (11). Journaled in the cover is a vertical shaft (45), known as the dolly shaft. Mounted to slide up and down this shaft is the dolly, which consists of a block of wood with pins projecting downward, so that when the cover is down, the pins extend into the clothes in the water in the tub. In operation the dolly shaft, and with it the dolly, is swung back and forth from 1\/2 to 3\/4 of a turn. A wringer is mounted on the side of the tub, and this wringer consists of two rolls which rotate towards each other and carry the clothes into another tub which contains rinse water. The clothes may be carried by the wringer rolls in either direction. The power commonly used is a small electric motor. This motor (23) is fastened on the bottom of the tub and the armature shaft of the motor is secured to a small pulley (22) connected by a belt (21) with a balance wheel (20) journaled on a stub shaft supported from the bracket (13). This large pulley wheel or belt wheel has secured on the hub a small spur gear pinion (17) which meshes with a large spur gear wheel (16) which is secured on the outer end of the horizontal power shaft (15) which is journaled in two bearings (14) projecting upward from the bracket or bearing. When the motor is running the train of gearing keeps the power shaft (15) running always in the same \n\n[247 U.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n direction at an average slower rate of speed than the armature shaft of the motor. The power shaft swings and rotates the vertical dolly shaft back and forth. A spur gear pinion (40), secured on the shaft (15), which meshes with the larger spur gear wheel (44) secured on the shaft (43) journaled in bearings (42). The spur gear wheel (44) carries an eccentric gear which is connected by a pitman (48) with a pin on the horizontal reciprocating rack bar (47). This rack bar is in mesh with a spur gear pinion (46) secured on the top of the dolly shaft so that the power shaft being continuously rotated in one direction, the dolly shaft (45) is swung back and forth in alternate directions.\n From the power shaft (15) a train of gearing to the wringer rolls has secured on it a small bevel gear (15a) which meshes with two miter gears ( 26 and 27) mounted on a shaft (24) extending at right angles to the power shaft. The shaft (24) has secured on it, so that it can slide back and forth on the shaft, but must always rotate with the shaft, a clutch sleeve ( 30) which has on its ends clutch teeth shaped to be engaged with similar clutch teeth on the inner ends of the hubs of the miter gears (26 and 27). The clutch sleeve is engaged with only one miter gear at a time, and if it engages with one miter gear, the wringer rolls are rotated in one direction; if it engages with the other, the wringer rolls are rotated in the opposite direction, so that the shifting of the clutch sleeve reverses the direction of the rotation of the wringer rolls. To do this shifting there is an operating handle (34) which extends beneath the wringer to a position where it can be readily operated by the person doing the washing. The handle (34) is secured on the end of a rock shaft (32) which has an upwardly projecting arm (33) that fits into an annular groove (30), into the clutch sleeve (39), so that as you swing the handle the clutch sleeve is moved from one position to another. The connection between \n\n[247 U.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n shaft (24) and shaft (39) on which the wringer roll is secured, consists of a sprocket pinion (36) secured on the outer end of the shaft (24) connected by a sprocket chain (37) with a large sprocket wheel (38) secured on the outer end of the shaft (39).\n The method of operation is to place a batch of clothing in soapy water in the tub, and when the electric motor is started, the driving shaft and the spur gear pinion, secured thereon, are put into rotation, when the hinged cover of the machine is brought down it has the effect of causing the spur gear wheel to go into mesh with the spur gear pinion and to set the dolly shaft and its head into reciprocating motion, thus scrubbing the clothes in the tub. When the cover of the washer is swung up, the gear of the dolly is automatically thrown out of gear with the pinion, the main driving shaft still continuously rotating. The operating handle is shifted so as to cause the clutch sleeve to engage with the hub of the bevel pinion, thereby causing the bevel pinion secured to the end of the main drive shaft, to drive the shaft (24) and through the latter the sprocket wheel (36) chain (37), the sprocket wheel (38) and the shaft of the lower wringer roll, causing the wringer rolls to rotate so that a garment placed between them will be carried outwardly. When the first batch of clothes has been washed, and passed through the wringer, a second batch of clothes is inserted in the soapy water in the washer, and the cover of the washer again swung down, thereby, in the manner described, putting the dolly into action again. While the second batch of clothes is being washed, the operator shifts the handle which controls the wringing mechanism, so as to reverse the motion of the wringer rolls, so that the garments in the rinse water tub may be passed back through the rolls of the wringer, and cast into a hamper. The second action of the wringer rolls takes place simultaneously with the washing of the second batch of clothes. \n\n[247 U.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n The net result, it is contended, of the Phillips patent is that the washing and wringing are carried on simultaneously and the operations of the wringer rolls are controlled by the handle described.\n The claims alleged to be infringed are numbers 5 to 8 inclusive. Number 6 was selected by the petitioner as typical in character, and is as follows: \n'6. A gearing device of the class described, comprising a support, a power shaft mounted on the support, means for imparting a continuous rotary motion to the power shaft, an upright shaft 45 mounted in the support, a driving device for the upright shaft operatively connected with the power shaft and capable of imparting an alternating rotary motion to the upright shaft, a horizontal shaft 39, a driving mechanism for the said shaft 39 connected with the power shaft and capable of imparting a rotary motion to the shaft 39, and a controlling means applied to the driving device for the shaft 39, for reversing the movement thereof and also for operatively disconnecting the shaft 39 from the driving shaft.\n\n Confessedly all the elements of the Phillips patent are old. The merits of the combination, which it is contended, involve invention and validate the patent, are that this gearing device, applied and operated as specified, enables the washing of a part of the clothes to be performed at the same time that the wringing process is being applied to other clothes. Thus, it is said, saving time in doing the washing, and, furthermore, by the operation of the control handle the rolls may be reversed or instantly stopped as the needs, convenience and safety of the operator may require. These things, the simultaneous washing and wringing, with the operation of the control handle, for the purposes sta ed, embrace the advances alleged to have been accomplished upon the prior art. In this view it is unnecessary to particularize the prior patents disclosed in the art. The question is, does this \n\n[247 U.S. 426, 432]\n\u00a0\n bringing together of old elements accomplishing the purposes stated amount to that combination which is invention within the meaning of the patent law; or does the gearing device, thus applied and used, show only an aggregation of old element's performing well-known functions, producing no novel and useful result entitling the aggregation to the protection of a patent?\n It is not always easy to decide this question, as the difference of opinion in the Circuit Courts of Appeals in this case illustrates. Generally speaking, a combination of old elements in order to be patentable must produce by their joint action a novel and useful result, or an old result in a more advantageous way. To arrive at the distinctions between combinations and aggregations definite reference must be had to the decisions of this court. The subject was fully discussed in Palmer v. Corning, \n156 U.S. 342\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 381, wherein the previous decisions were reviewed. The rule stated in Hailes v. Van Wormer, 20 Wall. 353, 368, was quoted with approval, wherein the court said:\n'It must be conceded that a new combination, if it produces new and useful results, is patentable, though all the constituents of the combination were well known and in common use before the combination was made. But the results must be a product of the combination, and not a mere aggregate of several results, each the complete product of one of the combined elements. Combined results are not necessarily a novel result, nor are they an old result obtained in a new and improved manner. Merely bringing old devices into juxtaposition, and there allowing each to work out its own effect without the production of something novel, is not invention. No one by bringing together several old devices without producing a new and useful result, the joint product of the elements of the combination and something more than an aggregate of old results, can acquire a right to prevent others from \n\n[247 U.S. 426, 433]\n\u00a0\n using the same devices, either singly or in other combinations, or, even if a new and useful result is obtained, can prevent others from using some of the devices, omitting others, in combination.' Hailes v. Van Wormer, 20 Wall. 353, 368.\n\n In Richards v. Chase Elevator Co., \n158 \nU.S. 299, 302\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 831, 833 [39 L. Ed. 991], the rule was stated as follows:\n'Unless the combination accomplishes some new result, the mere multiplicity of elements does not make it patentable. So long as each element performs some old and well-known function, the result is not a patentable combination, but an aggregation of elements.'\n\n In Specialty Manufacturing Company v. Fenton Metallic Manufacturing Co., \n174 \nU.S. 492, 498\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 641, 643 [43 L. Ed. 1058], the rule was again tersely stated:\n'Where a combination of old devices produces a new result such combination is doubtless patentable, but where the combination is not only of old elements, but of old results, and no new function is evolved from such combination, it falls within the ruling of this court in Hailes v. Van Wormer, 20 Wall. 353, 368 [22 L. Ed. 241]; Reckendorfer v. Faber, \n92 U.S. 347\n, 356 [23 L. Ed. 719]; Phillips v. Detroit, \n111 U.S. 604\n [4 Sup. Ct. 580]; Brinkerhoff v. Aloe, \n146 U.S. 515\n, 517 [13 Sup. Ct. 221]; Palmer v. Corning, \n156 U.S. 342\n, 345 [15 Sup. Ct. 381]; Richards v. Chase Elevator Co., \n158 U.S. 299\n [15 Sup. Ct. 831].'\n\n Applying the rule thus authoritatively settled by this court, we think no invention is shown in assembling these old elements for the purposes declared. No new function is 'evolved from this combination'; the new result, so far as one is achieved, is only that which arises from the well-known operation of each one of the elements.\n In the gearing specified every element is old. The operations of the wringer and the washing machine, although simultaneous, are independent one of the other. The control of the operation of the wringer is by an old and well-known method. From the co-operation of the ele- \n\n[247 U.S. 426, 434]\n\u00a0\n ments, here brought together, no new result, involving the exercise of the creative faculty which is invention is achieved. Phillips may have produced a more convenient and economical mechanism than others who preceded him, but superiority does not make an aggregation patentable. Specialty Manufacturing Co. v. Fenton Metallic Manufacturing Co., supra. The assemblage of the old elements, and their operation in the manner indicated may save time, and the mechanism may meet with a readier sale than other similar devices, but these things may result from mechanical skill and commercial enterprise, and do not necessarily involve invention.\n To borrow an illustration made at the argument, we think the Phillips aggregation of elements may be likened to the operation of a number of different machines in a factory by power applied from the same line shaft, each operation contributing its separate part to the production of a given result. So in this instance we think the combination accomplished by Phillips fails to show that exercise of invention, producing a novel and useful result from the co-operating action of the elements, which is essential to distinguish patentable combination from an aggregation of old elements so placed by mechanical skill as to do work more rapidly and economically.\n We agree with the conclusion reached by the court below.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA dissents. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGULF OIL CORPORATION v.

Herron, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover a tax levied upon certain dividends as income, under the Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, section II, 38 Stat. 114, 166. The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiff, 242 Fed. 709, but this judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 245 Fed. 1, 158 C. C. A. 1.\n The facts may be abridged from the findings below as follows: The petitioner was a holding company owning \n\n[248 U.S. 71, 72]\n\u00a0\n all the stock in the other corporations concerned except the qualifying shares held by directors. These companies with others constituted a single enterprise, carried on by the petitioner, of producing, buying, transporting, refining and selling oil. The subsidiary companies had retained their earnings, although making some loans inter se, and all their funds were invested in properties or actually required to carry on the business, so that the debtor companies had no money available to pay their debts. In January, 1913, the petitioner decided to take over the previously accumulated earnings and surplus and did so in that year by votes of the companies that it controlled. But, disregarding the forms gone through, the result was merely that the petitioner became the holder of the debts previously due from one of its companies to another. It was no richer than before, but its property now was represented by stock in and debts due from its subsidiaries, whereas formerly it was represented by the stock alone, the change being effected by entries upon the respective companies' books. The earnings thus transferred had been accumulated and had been used as capital before the taxing year. Lynch v. Turrish, \n247 \nU.S. 221, 228\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 537\n\n\n We are of opinion that the decision of the District Court was right. It is true that the petitioner and its subsidiaries were distinct beings in contemplation of law, but the facts that they were related as parts of one enterprise, all owned by the petitioner, that the debts were all enterprise debts due to members, and that the dividends represented earnings that had been made in former years and that practically had been converted into capital, unite to convince us that the transaction should be regarded as bookkeeping rather than as 'dividends declared and paid in the ordinary course by a corporation.' Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339, 346\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 543. The petitioner did not itself do the business of its subsidiaries and have \n\n[248 U.S. 71, 73]\n\u00a0\n possession of their property as in Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, \n247 U.S. 330\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 540, but the principle of that case must be taken to cover this. By section II, G, (c), 38 Stat. 174, and S, 38 Stat. 202, the tax from January 1 to February 28, 1913, is levied as a special excise tax, but in view of our decision that the dividends here concerned were not income it is unnecessary to discuss the further question that has been raised under the latter clause as to the effect of the fact that excise taxes upon the subsidiary corporations had been paid.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGULF, C & S F R. CO. v. STATE OF TEXAS(1918)\nNo. 158\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 58, 59]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. W. Terry, of Galveston, Tex., Alex. Britton and Evans Browne, both of Washington, D. C., A. H. Culwell, of El Paso, Tex., and Robert Dunlap and Gardiner Lathrop, both of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. B. F. Looney and Luther Nickels, both of Austin, Tex., for State of Texas.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the State to compel the defendant railroad, the plaintiff in error, to stop two interstate trains, one numbered 17 and southbound, the other numbered 18 and northbound, at the City of Meridian, for a time sufficient to receive and let off passengers. Meridian is the County Seat of Bosque County and has a population of 1500. Two other trains of the defendant going each way stopped there daily, but the Railroad Commission of the State found that these were insufficient for the needs of business at that station and made the order that this suit \n\n[246 U.S. 58, 60]\n\u00a0\n seeks to have carried out. The statute of Texas giving to the Commission power to make such order contains a proviso that 'four trains each way, carrying passengers for hire, if so many are run daily, Sundays excepted, be required to stop as aforesaid at all county seat stations'-so that the Commission seems to have obeyed a statutory mandate. Art. 6676, (2), Vernon's Sayles' Texas Civil Statutes. Another article, 6672, imposes a penalty of not more than $5,000 for every failure to obey such lawful order, and this suit seeks to recover penalties as well. The trial Court confirmed the finding of the Commission that the present service is insufficient, and the order, and imposed a fine of $22,400, being $100 for each failure to stop. It stated the facts in great detail but it will not be necessary to repeat them here. The Court of Civil Appeals again confirmed the above finding and affirmed the judgment. The Supreme Court of the State refused to allow a writ of error, declaring itself unable to say that the conclusion of the lower Court was unwarranted as matter of law.\n This case does not require quite so critical an examination into the facts as was made in Mississippi R. R. Commission v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., \n203 \nU.S. 335, 344\n, 345 S., 27 Sup. Ct. 90, and Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Wharton, \n207 \nU.S. 328, 330\n, 334 S., 335, 28 Sup. Ct. 121, in order to decide whether the judgment of the State Courts and Commission and, it would seem, of the legislature, was wrong. If the reasoning that prevailed with the Court of Civil Appeals were applied to Meridian simply in view of the number of its inhabitants there would be a serious question whether it could be sustained. For the consideration most emphasized was that no sleeping cars were attached to the local trains and that in order to make use of such accommodation on the trains in question passengers had to get in or out at stations from seven or eight to twelve or fifteen miles away. It was thought that when the railroad fur- \n\n[246 U.S. 58, 61]\n\u00a0\n nished such accommodations to a part of the public it was bound to furnish the same to all others-a very questionable proposition as applied. The other fact relied upon was that passengers not infrequently came on trains 17 and 18 destined for Meridian and had to get out at Morgan or Clifton, the next stations to the north and south. We repeat that whether these facts would justify an intermeddling with interstate trains in favor of a place of this size, merely as such, would be a serious question. But the State Court sustained the order as one required by statute in favor of county seats, up to the number of four trains each way, Sundays excepted. The law is not directed adversely at interstate trains, but expresses the specific judgment of the legisla ure as to the needs of the county seats, all of which, of course, it knew. If its judgment is correct, which we have no grounds for denying, the order may be justified, so far as its interference with interstate commerce is concerned, unless some other fact shows that the burden is too great.\n The only additional facts material to this point are that the defendant competes with railroads having shorter routes, that for that reason and in order to keep its contracts for the carriage of United States mails it has to make fast time-and that it has little or none to spare. On the other hand Meridian is the only county seat at which it does not stop, and it does stop at some smaller places, as well as make a detour in order to go through Houston. The time that would be taken would be four or five minutes for Number 17, and about 10 minutes for Number 18, according to the trial Court. The Court of Civil Appeals says in general terms from three to five. We are not prepared to say that the finding that there will be no unreasonable burden is wrong.\n It is urged that the power of the State Commission has been taken away by the Hepburn Amendment to the Act to Regulate Commerce (Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379), of June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  1, 34 \n\n[246 U.S. 58, 62]\n\u00a0\n Stats. 584, and the further Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309,  7, 36 Stats. 546, making it the duty of carriers, including sleeping car companies, to make reasonable regulations affecting the facilities for transportation, the Interstate Commerce Commission having jurisdiction over such matters. But the State requires certain services to county seats with an aim that is not directed against interstate trains as such. The statute is subordinate to the regulations of the Commission so far as it may lead to an incidental interference with such trains and in the absence of any conflict it may stand as here applied. See Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin, \n237 \nU.S. 220, 233\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 560.\n The other point argued here is that the railroad could not be subjected to, at most, more than one penalty while the validity of the order was awaiting judicial determination. Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 147 28 Sup. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764, being relied upon.

C., and Junius Parker, of New York City, for appellees.\n\n\n[247 U.S. 251, 268]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A bill was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina by a father in his own behalf and as next friend of his two minor sons, one under the age of fourteen years and the other between the ages of fourteen and sixteen years, employes in a cotton mill at Charlotte, North Carolina, to enjoin the enforcement of the act of Congress intended to prevent interstate commerce in the products of child labor. Act Sept. 1, 1916, 39 Stat. 675, c. 432 (Comp. St. 1916,  8819a- 8816f).\n The District Court held the act unconstitutional and entered a decree enjoining its enforcement. This appeal brings the case here. The first section of the act is in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[247 U.S. 251, 269]\n\u00a0\n Other sections of the act contain provisions for its enforcement and prescribe penalties for its violation.\n The attack upon the act rests upon three propositions: First: It is not a regulation of interstate and foreign commerce; second: It contravenes the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution; third: It conflicts with the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\n The controlling question for decision is: Is it within the authority of Congress in regulating commerce among the states to prohibit the transportation in interstate commerce of manufactured goods, the product of a factory in which, within thirty days prior to their removal therefrom, children under the age of fourteen have been employed or permitted to work, or children between the ages of fourteen and sixteen years have been employed or permitted to work more than eight hours in any day, or more than six days in any week, or after the hour of 7 o'clock p. m., or before the hour of 6 o'clock a. m.?\n The power essential to the passage of this act, the government contends, is found in the commerce clause of the Constitution which authorizes Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states.\n In Gibbons v. Ogdon, 9 Wheat. 1, Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for this court, and defining the extent and nature of the commerce power, said, 'It is the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.' In other words, the power is one to control the means by which commerce is carried on, which is \n\n[247 U.S. 251, 270]\n\u00a0\n directly the contrary of the assumed right to forbid commerce from moving and thus destroying it as to particular commodities. But it is insisted that adjudged cases in this court establish the doctrine that the power to regulate given to Congress incidentally includes the authority to prohibit the movement of ordinary commodities and therefore that the subject is not open for discussion. The cases demonstrate the contrary. They rest upon the character of the particular subjects dealt with and the fact that the scope of governmental authority, state or national, possessed over them is such that the authority to prohibit is as to them but the exertion of the power to regulate.\n The first of these cases is Champion v. Ames, \n188 U.S. 321\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 321, the so-called Lottery Case, in which it was held that Congress might pass a law having the effect to keep the channels of commerce free from use in the transportation of tickets used in the promotion of lottery schemes. In Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, \n220 U.S. 45\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 364, this court sustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act (Act June 30, 1906, c. 3915, 34 Stat. 768 [Comp. St. 1916,  8717-8728]), which prohibited the introduction into the states by means of interstate commerce of impure foods and drugs. In Hoke v. United States, \n227 U.S. 308\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 281, 43 L. R. A. (N. S.) 906, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 905, this court sustained the constitutionality of the so-called 'White Slave Traffic Act' ( Act June 25, 1910, c. 395, 36 Stat. 825 [Comp. St. 1916,  8812-8819]), whereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was forbidden. In that case we said, having reference to the authority of Congress, under the regulatory power, to protect the channels of interstate commerce:\n'If the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of lotteries, the debasement of obscene literature, the contagion of diseased cattle or persons, the impurity of food and drugs, the like facility can be taken away from the systematic enticement to, and the enslavement in prostitution and debauchery of women, and, more insistently, of girls.' \n\n[247 U.S. 251, 271]\n\u00a0\n In Caminetti v. United States, \n242 U.S. 470\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 1 2, L. R. A. 1917F, 502, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 1168, we held that Congress might prohibit the transportation of women in interstate commerce for the purposes of debauchery and kindred purposes. In Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Railway Co., \n242 U.S. 311\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 180, L. R. A. 1917B, 1218, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 845, the power of Congress over the transportation of intoxicating liquors was sustained. In the course of the opinion it was said:\n\n'The power conferred is to regulate, and the very terms of the grant would seem to repel the contention that only prohibition of movement in interstate commerce was embraced. And the cogency of this is manifest, since if the doctrine were applied to those manifold and important subjects of interstate commerce as to which Congress from the beginning has regulated, not prohibited, the existence of government under the Constitution would be no longer possible.'\n\n And concluding the discussion which sustained the authority of the Government to prohibit the transportation of liquor in interstate commerce, the court said:\n'... The exceptional nature of the subject here regulated is the basis upon which the exceptional power exerted must rest and affords no ground for any fear that such power may be constitutionally extended to things which it may not, consistently with the guaranties of the Constitution embrace.'\n\n In each of these instances the use of interstate transportation was necessary to the accomplishment of harmful results. In other words, although the power over interstate transportation was to regulate, that could only be accomplished by prohibiting the use of the facilities of interstate commerce to effect the evil intended.\n This element is wanting in the present case. The thing intended to be accomplished by this statute is the denial of the facilities of interstate commerce to those manufacturers in the states who employ children within the prohibited ages. The act in its effect does not regulate \n\n[247 U.S. 251, 272]\n\u00a0\n transportation among the states, but aims to standardize the ages at which children may be employed in mining and manufacturing within the states. The goods shipped are of themselves harmless. The act permits them to be freely shipped after thirty days from the time of their removal from the factory. When offered for shipment, and before transportation begins, the labor of their production is over, and the mere fact that they were intended for interstate commerce transportation does not make their production subject to federal control under the commerce power.\n Commerce 'consists of intercourse and traffic ... and includes the transportation of persons and property, as well as the purchase, sale and exchange of commodities.' The making of goods and the mining of coal are not commerce, nor does the fact that these things are to be afterwards shipped, or used in interstate commerce, make their production a part thereof. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co. v. Yurkonis, \n238 U.S. 439\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 902\n\n\n Over interstate transportation, or its incidents, the regulatory power of Congress is ample, but the production of articles, intended for interstate commerce, is a matter of local regulation. 'When the commerce begins is determined, not by the character of the commodity, nor by the intention of the owner to transfer it to another state for sale, nor by his preparation of it for transportation, but by its actual delivery to a common carrier for transportation, or the actual commencement of its transfer to another state.' Mr. Justice Jackson in Re Greene (C. C.) 52 Fed. 113. This principle has been recognized often in this court. Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 475; Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 U.S. 504\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 299, and cases cited. If it were otherwise, all manufacture intended for interstate shipment would be brought under federal control to the practical exclusion of the authority of the states, a result certainly not contemplated by the \n\n[247 U.S. 251, 273]\n\u00a0\n framers of the Constitution when they vested in Congress the authority to regulate commerce among the States. Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 21\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 6.\n It is further contended that the authority of Congress may be exerted to control interstate commerce in the shipment of childmade goods because of the effect of the circulation of such goods in other states where the evil of this class of labor has been recognized by local legislation, and the right to thus employ child labor has been more rigorously restrained than in the state of production. In other words, that the unfair competition, thus engendered, may be controlled by closing the channels of interstate commerce to manufacturers in those states where the local laws do not meet what Congress deems to be the more just standard of other states.\n There is no power vested in Congress to require the states to exercise their police power so as to prevent possible unfair competition. Many causes may co-operate to give one state, by reason of local laws or conditions, an economic advantage over others. The commerce clause was not intended to give to Congress a general authority to equalize such conditions. In some of the states laws have been passed fixing minimum wages for women, in others the local law regulates the hours of labor of women in various employments. Business done in such states may be at an economic disadvantage when compared with states which have no such regulations; surely, this fact does not give Congress the power to deny transportation in interstate commerce to those who carry on business where the hours of labor and the rate of compensation for women have not been fixed by a standard in use in other states and approved by Congress.\n The grant of power of Congress over the subject of interstate commerce was to enable it to regulate such commerce, and not to give it authority to control the \n\n[247 U.S. 251, 274]\n\u00a0\n states in their exercise of the police power over local trade and manufacture.\n The grant of authority over a purely federal matter was not intended to destroy the local power always existing and carefully reserved to the states in the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution.\n Police regulations relating to the internal trade and affairs of the states have been uniformly recognized as within such control. 'This,' said this court in United States v. Dewitt, 9 Wall. 41, 45, 'has been so frequently declared by this court, results so obviously from the terms of the Constitution, and has been so fully explained and supported on former occasions, that we think it unnecessary to enter again upon the discussion.' See Keller v. United States, \n213 \nU.S. 138, 144\n, 145 S., 146, 29 Sup. Ct. 470, 16 Ann. Cas. 1066; Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (7th Ed.) p. 11.\n In the judgment which established the broad power of Congress over interstate commerce, Chief Justice Marshall said (9 Wheat. 203):\n'They [inspection laws] act upon the subject, before it becomes an article of foreign commerce, or of commerce among the states, and prepare it for that purpose. They form a portion of that immense mass of legislation, which embraces everything within the territory of a state, not surrendered to the general government; all of which can be most advantageously exercised by the states themselves. Inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws of every description, as well as laws for regulating the internal commerce of a state, and those which respect turnpike roads, ferries, etc., are component parts of this mass.'\n\n And in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, the same great judge said:\n'That the framers of the Constitution did not intend to restrain the states in the regulation of their civil institutions, adopted for internal government, and that \n\n[247 U.S. 251, 275]\n\u00a0\n the instrument they have given us is not to be so construed may be admitted.'\n\n That there should be limitations upon the right to employ children in mines and factories in t e interest of their own and the public welfare, all will admit. That such employment is generally deemed to require regulation is shown by the fact that the brief of counsel states that every state in the Union has a law upon the subject, limiting the right to thus employ children. In North Carolina, the state wherein is located the factory in which the employment was had in the present case, no child under twelve years of age is permitted to work.\n It may be desirable that such laws be uniform, but our federal government is one of enumerated powers; 'this principle,' declared Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 'is universally admitted.'\n A statute must be judged by its natural and reasonable effect. Collins v. New Hampshire, \n171 \nU.S. 30, 33\n, 34 S., 18 Sup. Ct. 768. The control by Congress over interstate commerce cannot authorize the exercise of authority not entrusted to it by the Constitution. Pipe Line Case, \n234 \nU.S. 548, 560\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 956. The maintenance of the authority of the states over matters purely local is as essential to the preservation of our institutions as is the conservation of the supremacy of the federal power in all matters entrusted to the nation by the federal Constitution.\n In interpreting the Constitution it must never be forgotten that the nation is made up of states to which are entrusted the powers of local government. And to them and to the people the powers not expressly delegated to the national government are reserved. Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76. The power of the states to regulate their purely internal affairs by such laws as seem wise to the local authority is inherent and has never been surrendered to the general government. \n\n[247 U.S. 251, 276]\n\u00a0\n New York v. Miln, 11 Pet. 102, 139; Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 63; Kidd v. Pearson, supra. To sustain this statute would not be in our judgment a recognition of the lawful exertion of congressional authority over interstate commerce, but would sanction an invasion by the federal power of the control of a matter purely local in its character, and over which no authority has been delegated to Congress in conferring the power to regulate commerce among the states.\n We have neither authority nor disposition to question the motives of Congress in enacting this legislation. The purposes intended must be attained consistently with constitutional limitations and not by an invasion of the powers of the states. This court has no more important function than that which devolves upon it the obligation to preserve inviolate the constitutional limitations upon the exercise of authority federal and state to the end that each may continue to discharge, harmoniously with the other, the duties entrusted to it by the Constitution.\n In our view the necessary effect of this act is, by means of a prohibition against the movement in interstate commerce of ordinary commercial commodities to regulate the hours of labor of children in factories and mines within the states, a purely state authority. Thus the act in a two-fold sense is repugnant to the Constitution. It not only transcends the authority delegated to Congress over commerce but also exerts a power as to a purely local matter to which the federal authority does not extend. The far reaching result of upholding the act cannot be more plainly indicated than by pointing out that if Congress can thus regulate matters entrusted to local authority by prohibition of the movement of commodities in interstate commerce, all freedom of commerce will be at an end, and the power of the states over local matters may be eliminated, and thus our system of government be practically destroyed. \n\n[247 U.S. 251, 277]\n\u00a0\n For these reasons we hold that this law exceeds the constitutional authority of Congress. It follows that the decree of the District Court must be\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n The single question in this case is whethe Congress has power to prohibit the shipment in interstate or foreign commerce of any product of a cotton mill situated in the United States, in which within thirty days before the removal of the product children under fourteen have been employed, or children between fourteen and sixteen have been employed more than eight hours in a day, or more than six days in any week, or between seven in the evening and six in the morning. The objection urged against the power is that the States have exclusive control over their methods of production and that Congress cannot meddle with them, and taking the proposition in the sense of direct intermeddling I agree to it and suppose that no one denies it. But if an act is within the powers specifically conferred upon Congress, it seems to me that it is not made any less constitutional because of the indirect effects that it may have, however obvious it may be that it will have those effects, and that we are not at liberty upon such grounds to hold it void.\n The first step in my argument is to make plain what no one is likely to dispute-that the statute in question is within the power expressly given to Congress if considered only as to its immediate effects and that if invalid it is so only upon some collateral ground. The statute confines itself to prohibiting the carriage of certain goods in interstate or foreign commerce. Congress is given power to regulate such commerce in unqualified terms. It would not be argued today that the power to regulate does not include the power to prohibit. Regulation means the prohibition of something, and when interstate \n\n[247 U.S. 251, 278]\n\u00a0\n commerce is the matter to be regulated I cannot doubt that the regulation may prohibit any part of such commerce that Congress sees fit to forbid. At all events it is established by the Lottery Case and others that have followed it that a law is not beyond the regulative power of Congress merely because it prohibits certain transportation out and out. Champion v. Ames, \n188 \nU.S. 321, 355\n, 359 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 321, et seq. So I repeat that this statute in its immediate operation is clearly within the Congress's constitutional power.\n The question then is narrowed to whether the exercise of its otherwise constitutional power by Congress can be pronounced unconstitutional because of its possible reaction upon the conduct of the States in a matter upon which I have admitted that they are free from direct control. I should have thought that that matter had been disposed of so fully as to leave no room for doubt. I should have thought that the most conspicuous decisions of this Court had made it clear that the power to regulate commerce and other constitutional powers could not be cut down or qualified by the fact that it might interfere with the carrying out of the domestic policy of any State.\n The manufacture of oleomargarine is as much a matter of State regulation as the manufacture of cotton cloth. Congress levied a tax upon the compound when colored so as to resemble butter that was so great as obviously to prohibit the manufacture and sale. In a very elaborate discussion the present Chief Justice excluded any inquiry into the purpose of an act which apart from that purpose was within the power of Congress. McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561. As to foreign commerce see Weber v. Freed, \n239 \nU.S. 325, 329\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 131, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 317; Brolan v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 216, 217\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 285; Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 U.S. 470\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 349. Fifty years ago a tax on state banks, the obvious purpose and actual effect of which was to drive them, or at least \n\n[247 U.S. 251, 279]\n\u00a0\n their circulation, out of existence, was sustained, although the result was one that Congress had no constitutional power to require. The Court made short work of the argument as to the purpose of the Act. 'The Judicial cannot prescribe to the Legislative Departments of the Government l mitations upon the exercise of its acknowledged powers.' Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533. So it well might have been argued that the corporation tax was intended under the guise of a revenue measure to secure a control not otherwise belonging to Congress, but the tax was sustained, and the objection so far as noticed was disposed of by citing McCray v. United States; Flint .v Stone Tracy Co., \n220 U.S. 107\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312. And to come to cases upon interstate commerce notwithstanding United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n156 U.S. 1\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 249, the Sherman Act (Act July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209) has been made an instrument for the breaking up of combinations in restraint of trade and monopolies, using the power to regulate commerce as a foothold, but not proceeding because that commerce was the end actually in mind. The objection that the control of the States over production was interfered with was urged again and again but always in vain. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 68\n, 69 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734; United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106, 184\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 632; Hoke v.

Ed. 364), with the intimation that 'no trade can be carried on between the States to which it [the power of Congress to regulate commerce] does not extend,' applies not merely to articles that the changing opinions of the time condemn as intrinsically harmful but to others innocent in themselves, simply on the ground that the order for them was induced by a preliminary fraud. Weeks v. United States, \n245 U.S. 618\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 219, 62 L. Ed . --. It does not matter whether the supposed \n\n[247 U.S. 251, 280]\n\u00a0\n evil precedes or follows the transportation. It is enough that in the opinion of Congress the transportation encourages the evil. I may add that in the cases on the so-called White Slave Act it was established that the means adopted by Congress as convenient to the exercise of its power might have the character af police regulations. Hoke v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 308, 323\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 281, 43 L. R. A. (N. S.) 906, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 905; Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470, 492\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 192, L. R.

Hardin, \n135 \nU.S. 100, 108\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 681, is quoted with seeming approval to the effect that 'a subject matter which has been confided exclusively to Congress by the Constitution is not within the jurisdiction of the police power of the State unless placed there by congressional action.' I see no reason for that proposition not applying here.\n The notion that prohibition is any less prohibition when applied to things now thought evil I do not understand. But if there is any matter upon which civilized countries have agreed-far more unanimously than they have with regard to intoxicants and some other matters over which this country is now emotionally aroused-it is the evil of premature and excessive child labor. I should have thought that if we were to introduce our own moral conceptions where is my opinion they do not belong, this was preeminently a case for upholding the exercise of all its powers by the United States.\n But I had thought that the propriety of the exercise of a power admitted to exist in some cases was for the consideration of Congress alone and that this Court always had disavowed the right to intrude its udgment upon questions of policy or morals. It is not for this Court to pronounce when prohibition is necessary to regulation if it ever may be necessary-to say that it is permissible as against strong drink but not as against the product of ruined lives. \n\n[247 U.S. 251, 281]\n\u00a0\n The Act does not meddle with anything belonging to the States. They may regulate their internal affairs and their domestic commerce as they like. But when they seek to send their products across the State line they are no longer within their rights. If there were no Constitution and no Congress their power to cross the line would depend upon their neighbors. Under the Constitution such commerce belongs not to the States but to Congress to regulate. It may carry out its views of public policy whatever indirect effect they may have upon the activities of the States. Instead of being encountered by a prohibitive tariff at her boundaries the State encounters the public policy of the United States which it is for Congress to express. The public policy of the United States is shaped with a view to the benefit of the nation as a whole. If, as has been the case within the memory of men still living, a State should take a different view of the propriety of sustaining a lottery from that which generally prevails, I cannot believe that the fact would require a different decision from that reached in Champion v. Ames. Yet in that case it would be said with quite as much force as in this that Congress was attempting to intermeddle with the State's domestic affairs. The national welfare as understood by Congress may require a different attitude within its sphere from that of some self-seeking State. It seems to me entirely constitutional for Congress to enforce its understanding by all the means at its command.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That no producer, manufacturer, or dealer shall ship or deliver for shipment in interstate or foreign commerce any article or commodity the product of any mine or quarry, situated in the United States, in which within thirty days prior to the time of the removal of such product therefrom children under the age of sixteen years have been employed or permitted to work, or any article or commodity the product of any mill, cannery, workshop, factory, or manufacturing establishment, situated in the United States, in which within thirty days prior to the removal of such product therefrom children under the age of fourteen years have been employed or permitted to work, or children between the ages of fourteen years and sixteen years have been employed or permitted to work more than eight hours in any day, or more t an six days in any week, or after the hour of seven o'clock postmeridian, or before the hour of six o'clock antemeridian.' \n\n\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARTRANFT v. MULLOWNY(1918)\nNo. 19\nArgued: February 23, 1916Decided: June 3, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 295, 296]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Matthew E. O'Brien and Henry E. Davis, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On April 17, 1914, an information in behalf of the United States was filed by the United States Attorney in the Police court of the District of Columbia against the plaintiff in error (who will be called the petitioner) charging violations of the Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 768, c. 3915, Comp. St. 1916,  8717-8728). Having first objected to the jurisdiction of the police court by motion to quash, by demurrer, and by special plea in bar, all of which were overruled by that court, petitioner was arraigned upon the information and pleaded not guilty, after which, and before trial on the merits, he filed in the Supreme Court of the District a petition praying that a writ of certiorari might issue from that court to the present defendant in error as judge of the police court to bring up the record and proceedings, upon the grounds (1) that the police court was without jurisdiction to try petitioner upon the infor- \n\n[247 U.S. 295, 297]\n\u00a0\n mation, for several reasons specified, and (2) that the information did not sufficiently inform petitioner of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and his trial thereon would deprive him of his constitutional right in that behalf. The writ of certiorari was issued as prayed, return was made setting forth the information and a memorandum of the proceedings thereon, and afterwards a motion was made in the Supreme Court by the United States Attorney, in the name of the respondent, to quash the writ because the police court had jurisdiction and had assumed jurisdiction of the cause of action involved in the information. Upon consideration the Supreme Court granted this motion, petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals of the District, that court affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court (43 App. D. C. 44), and to review the judgment of affirmance the present writ of error was sued out.\n At the threshold we are confronted with the question whether we have jurisdiction to proceed under the latter writ. If we have, it must arise under section 250, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1159, Comp. St. 1916,  1227), which, so far as need be quoted, runs as follows: 'Any final judgment or decree of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia may be re-examined and affirmed, reversed, or modified by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon writ of error or appeal, in the following cases'-specifying, among others, 'cases in which the jurisdiction of the trial court is in issue,' and 'cases in which the construction of any law of the United States is drawn in question by the defendant,' and then proceeding: 'Except as provided in the next succeeding section, the judgments and decrees of said Court of Appeals shall be final in all cases arising under the patent laws, the copyright laws, the revenue laws, the criminal laws, and in admiralty cases.' The succeeding section confers upon this court the discretionary power to review, by certiorari \n\n[247 U.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n or otherwise, judgments and decrees of the Court of Appeals otherwise made final by section 250.\n Our jurisdiction is invoked upon the ground that the police court has not jurisdiction to try the information, and that the construction of the Food and Drugs Act, a law of the United States, is drawn in question by plaintiff in error, who was defendant below. The motion to dismiss is based upon the twofold ground that the case is one arising under the criminal laws, and that the judgment of the court of appeals is not a final judgment within the meaning of the opening words of section 250. If the case is one so arising, or if the judgment is not final, the fact that the jurisdiction of the police court, or the construction of a law of the United States, is in question, will not give us jurisdiction. Chott v. Ewing, \n237 \nU.S. 197, 201\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 571; see McLish v. Roff, \n141 U.S. 661\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 118. It is conceded by petitioner that the information in the police court presents a case arising under the criminal laws within the meaning of the section, and that this has not proceeded to final judgment; the response to the motion to dismiss being that the proceeding by certiorari in the Su reme Court of the District was a separate and independent proceeding, not arising under the criminal laws, and that this has been finally concluded by the affirmance in the Court of Appeals of the judgment of the Supreme Court, leaving nothing to be done except the issuing of execution for costs.\n Whether it was a separate and independent proceeding must be determined by a consideration of the nature and office of the writ of certiorari, as employed in this case, and its relation to the criminal proceeding.\n The only provision of the District of Columbia Code respecting this form of writ is in section 68 (Act March 3, 1901, c. 854, 31 Stat. 1189, 1200), which provides:\n'The said Supreme Court may, in its appropriate special terms, issue writs of quo warranto, mandamus, prohibition, scire facias, certiorari, injunction, prohibitory and mandatory, \n\n[247 U.S. 295, 299]\n\u00a0\n ne exeat, and all other writs known in common law and equity practice that may be necessary to the effectve exercise of its jurisdiction.' Act March 3, 1901, c. 854, 31 Stat. 1189, 1200.\n\n Certiorari always has been recognized in the District as a appropriate process for reviewing the proceedings of a subordinate tribunal when it has proceeded, or is proceeding, to judgment without lawful jurisdiction. Kennedy v. Gorman, 4 Cranch, C. C. 347, Fed. Cas. No. 7702; Bates v. District of Columbia, 1 MacArthur (D. C.) 433, 449. And the power to employ the writ inheres in the Supreme Court of the District as possessing a general common-law jurisdiction and supervisory control over inferior tribunals, analogous to that of the King's Bench. United States v. West, 34 App. D. C. 12, 17. The Court of Appeals, in a recent case, declared:\n'There is no statute prescribing the function of, or regulating the procedure by, certiorari in the District of Columbia, hence we must look therefor to the common law. The writ lies to inferior courts and to special tribunals exercising judicial or quasi judicial functions, to bring their proceedings into the superior court, where they may be reviewed and quashed if it be made plainly to appear that such inferior court or special tribunal had no jurisdiction of the subject- matter, or had exceeded its jurisdiction, or had deprived a party of a right or imposed a burden upon him or his property, without due process of law.' Degge v. Hitchcock, 35 App. D. C. 218, 226, affirmed \n229 \nU.S. 162, 170\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 639.\n\n At the common law certiorari was one of the prerogative or discretionary writs by which the Court of King's Bench exercised its supervisory authority over inferior tribunals, and it was employed in three classes of cases, among others, viz.: (1) To bring up an indictment or presentment before trial in order to pass upon its validity, to take cognizance of special matters, bearing upon it, or to assure an impartial trial; if the accused was in cus- \n\n[247 U.S. 295, 300]\n\u00a0\n tody, it was usual to employ a habeas corpus as a companion writ; (2) as a quasi writ of error to review judgments of inferior courts of civil or of criminal jurisdiction, especially those proceeding otherwise than according to the course of the common law and therefore not subject to review by the ordinary writ of errorf and (3) as an auxiliary writ, in aid of a writ of error, to bring up outbranches of the record or other matters omitted from the return.\n The first of these functions is the one that now concerns us. Blackstone refers to it in these terms:\n'Thus much for process to bring in the offender after indictment found, during which stage of the prosecution it is, that writs of certiorari facias are usually had, though they may be had at any time before trial, to certify and remove the indictment, with all the proceedings thereon, from any inferior court of criminal jurisdiction into the Court of King's Bench, which is the sovereign ordinary court of justice in causes criminal. And this is frequently done for one of these four purposes; either (1) to consider and determine the validity of appeals or ndictments and the proceedings thereon, and to quash or confirm them as there is cause; or (2) where it is surmised that a partial or insufficient trial will probably be had in the court below, the indictment is removed, in order to have the prisoner or defendant tried at the bar of the Court of King's Bench, or before the justices of nisi prius; or (3) it is so removed, in order to plead the king's pardon there; or (4) to issue process of outlawry against the offender, in those counties or places where the process of the inferior judges will not reach him. Such writ of certiorari, when issued and delivered to the inferior court for removing any record or other proceeding, as well upon indictment as otherwise, supersedes the jurisdiction of such inferior court, and makes all subsequent proceedings therein entirely erroneous and illegal, unless the Court of King's Bench remands the record to \n\n[247 U.S. 295, 301]\n\u00a0\n the court below, to be there tried and determined.' 4 Black. Com. 320, 321.\n\n To the same effect is 2 Hale, P. C. 210, where the learned commentator further says:\n'If there be an indictment to be removed and the party be in custody, it is usual to have an habeas corpus to remove the prisoner, and a certiorari to remove the record, for as the certiorari alone removes not the body, so the habeas corpus alone removes not the record itself, but only the prisoner, with the cause of his commitment,' etc.\n\n See, also, Fitz. Nat. Brev. 245; Bacon's Abr. tit. Certiorari (A); Harris v. Barber, \n129 \nU.S. 366, 369\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 314.1\n The function of the writ of certiorari, when thus issued prior to judgment, being simply to remove the record and proceedings into the superior court, to the end that justice may there be done, by quashing the indictment or information, by proceeding to trial upon it, or otherwise as the circumstances of the case may require, it is obvious that it merely brings into play a supervisory jurisdiction, without changing the nature of the case that is to be heard and determined; that a decision by the \n\n[247 U.S. 295, 302]\n\u00a0\n reviewing court adverse to the accused upon any preliminary matter, and without trial upon the merits, followed by a remittitur to the court below, necessitates further proceedings before that court from the point at which they were interrupted by the allowance of the writ; and that a judgment quashing the writ of certiorari simply removes the obstacle that the writ interposed in the way of further proceedings in the court of first instance, so that a procedendo follows as a matter of course. And so are the authorities. 'If an indictment be removed after issue joined and remanded, the inferior court shall proceed as if no certiorari had been granted. ... (It is true, that while it continues on the file, the court cannot award a procedendo. But it may be taken off the file, if it have issued improvide; and when that is done, a procedendo will be granted.)' Bac. Abr. tit. Certiorari (K), citing Rex v. Wakefield, 1 Burr. 485, 488; Rex v. Clace, 4 Burr. 2456, 2459; Rex v. Micklethwayte, 4 Burr. 2522. And see Com. Dig., tit. Certiorari (G), citing Anonymous, 1 Salk. 144, to the effect that, if a certiorari be granted to remove an indictment and the cause suggested should afterwards appear false, a procedendo should be awarded. See, also, Kennedy v. Gorman, 4 Cranch, C. C. 347, 348, Fed. Cas. No. 7702.\n The record in the present case shows that from beginning to end it was recognized that the writ of certiorari was a mere method of removing the information and the proceedings thereon from the police court into the Supreme Court, for purposes of review; that it was not a new or independent cause, but a mere step in the pending criminal case, so that when the Supreme Court reached the conclusion that the writ ought to be quashed, the result was merely to remove this obstacle in the way of the exercise by the police court of its jurisdiction, and that the record ought to be remanded for further proceedings in that court. The prayer o the petitioner was:\n'That \n\n[247 U.S. 295, 303]\n\u00a0\n the writ of certiorari may issue from this court to the respondent commanding him to certify to this court the record and proceedings in the said cause so as aforesaid instituted and pending against the petitioner, to the end that the same may be considered by this court, and that there may be done in behalf thereof what of law and right ought to be done in the premises.'\n\n The writ issued in pursuance of this petition and addressed to the judge of the police court, after reciting that there was 'now pending before you a suit between the United States and the above-named petitioner, William A. Hartranft,' commanded the judge to send to the Supreme Court 'the record and proceedings in the said cause, so that the said Supreme Court may act therein as of right and according to the laws and customs of the United States should be done.' And the judgment of the Supreme Court was that the writ of certiorari be quashed, and the petition dismissed, and that the record be 'remanded to the police court of the District of Columbia, whence it came.' Clearly, this was an implied mandate for further proceedings in the police court. The judgment for costs was but incidental.\n The contention that the certiorari case in the Supreme Court was independent of the proceeding in the police court because the two cases bore different titles is without weight. The writ ran from the President of the United States to the judge by name, not in his personal, but in his official, capacity, as being in contemplation of law the custodian of the record (see State v. Howell, 24 N. J. Law, 519; Kirkpatrick v. Commissioners, 42 N. J. Law, 510; Hutchinson v. Rowan, 57 N. J. Law, 530, 31 Atl. 224); but the substance of it was a command that the record of the cause pending in the police court be removed into the Supreme Court for its consideration, and the execution of the writ did not change the nature of the cause but merely transferred it to a different court.\n There is a singular and fatal inconsistency between the \n\n[247 U.S. 295, 304]\n\u00a0\n grounds on which plaintiff in error invokes our jurisdiction and the ground on which he endeavors to maintain it. He comes saying, in order to bring himself within section 250, Judicial Code, that in this case (a) the jurisdiction of the trial court is in issue, and (b) the construction of a law of the United States was drawn in question by himself as defendant. But, in resisting the objection that the case is one arising under the criminal laws and the judgment is not final, he is obliged to take refuge in the theory that the certiorari proceeding was separate and independent from the police court proceeding. This, if granted, would leave him without a footing here, because in the certiorari proceeding the Supreme Court was the 'trial court,' and its jurisdiction was not and is not in issue; and in that proceeding he was prosecutor or plaintiff, not defendant, and it does not appear that the construction of any law of the United States was there drawn in question by defendant in error, who was defendant if the proceeding was an independent one. There is no escape from the dilemma.\n From what has been said it results that the decision of the Supreme Court was a decision in a case arising under the criminal laws; and, since it required further proceedings in the police court before the merits of the case could be determined, it was not a final judgment within the meaning of the opening words of section 250, Judicial Code. By section 226 of the District of Columbia Code, the Court of Appeals may review interlocutory orders of the Supreme Court, as well as final judgments; but it is unnecessary to say that, if the judgment reviewed was interlocutory, so is the judgment affirming it. Were we to review and affirm the latter judgment, a trial upon the merits in the police court would still be necessary. The bearing of this is manifest. Macfarland v. Brown, \n187 \nU.S. 239, 246\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 105.\n Two cases very much in point are to be found in the reports of New Jersey; both being decisions of the court \n\n[247 U.S. 295, 305]\n\u00a0\n of last resort. To show their pertinency, it should be premised that in that state the jurisdiction and practice of the Supreme Court are modeled after those of the King's Bench, and there is a review of its decisions by the Court of Errors and Appeals (as in the House of Lords), but only after final judgment. The practice of employing the writ of certiorari for the removal of an indictment or presentment before trial from the court of first instance into the Supreme Court has been recognized from the beginning, and regulated by statutes not departing essentially from the common-law practice. Act Feb. 6, 1799; Paterson's Laws, p. 350; Rev. Stat. 1847, p. 983; Gen. Stat. 1895, p. 367; P. L. 1903, p. 343; 1 Comp. Stat. ( 1910) p. 402. Upon the removal of an indictment into the Supreme Court by this process, if that court determines that the indictment is not sufficient in law, the person indicted is discharged; but, if it is found sufficient, the court may in its discretion retain it to be carried down for trial before the proper Circuit Court, or may order it returned to the court from which it was removed, there to be proceeded with in the same manner as if the writ had not been allowed. It is a common practice to use this writ in order to obtain the judgment of the Supreme Court upon the validity of an indictment, before trial. State v. Sailer, 16 N. J. Law, 357; State v. Powder Mfg. Co., 50 N. J. Law, 75, 11 Atl. 127; State v. New Jersey Jockey Club, 52 N. J. Law, 493, 19 Atl. 976; State v. Nugent, 77 N. J. Law, 157, 71 Atl. 481; State v. Kelsey, 80 N. J. Law, 641, 77 Atl. 1028. Such being the practice, in Parks v. State, 62 N. J. Law, 664, 43 Atl. 52, the return to a writ of error issued out of the Court of Errors and Appeals to the Supreme Court disclosed that the latter court, by certiorari to the sessions, had removed an indictment and entertained and denied a motion to quash it, and ordered the record to be remitted to the sessions to be proceeded in according to law. A motion having been made to dismiss the writ of error, the court, speaking by \n\n[247 U.S. 295, 306]\n\u00a0\n Chief Justice Magie, said:\n'When the Supreme Court, by virtue of its superintending power over inferior courts, brings, by certiorari, into it the proceedings of an inferior court upon an indictment, it has the option, at its discretion, to retain the cause and proceed to a final disposition of the issues presented, or to remit the proceedings to the inferior court. Gen. Stat. 368. Had the Supreme Court retained the cause now before us, it is obvious that no final judgment could have been reached until the accused had been convicted and sentenced or acquitted and discharged by that court. It is equally plain that, after the exercise of its option of remitting the proceedings to the sessions, no final judgment in the cause could have been reached until a similar result had been reached in that court. A certiorari in such cases is not the institution of a new suit, nor does it bring in question any final judgment. The result is that this writ was prematurely issued and must be dismissed.'\n\n To the same effect is State v. Kelsey, 82 N. J. Law, 542, 82 Atl. 13.\n For both reasons, that the case is one arising under the criminal laws and that the judgment is not final, we have no jurisdiction under section 250, Judicial Code, and the writ of error must be and is\n Dismissed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The use of the writ of certiorari, in conjunction with that of habeas corpus, has been a familiar part of the appellate procedure of this court from an early period, under section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 ( 1 Stat. 73, 81, c. 20; section 716, Rev. Stat.; section 262, Judicial Code [ Comp. St. 1916,  1239]).

Ct. 760. It is obvious that this use of the certiorari is available before conviction, in a proper case.\n An analogous use of the writ, before judgment in the court to which it is addressed, arises under section 239 or section 251, Judicial Code ( 36 Stat. 1157, 1159, Comp. St. 1916,  1216, 1228), where, upon questions of law being certified to us in any case pending in a Circuit Court of Appeals or in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, this court may require that the whole record and cause be sent up to it, and thereupon decide the whole matter in controversy as if it had been brought here by writ of error or appeal. In such a case the record is brought here by writ of certiorari, with the effect of submitting the cause to this court for decision instead of to the Court of Appeals. \n\n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAYS v. GAULEY MOUNTAIN COAL CO.(1918)\nNo. 31\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Henry B. Closson, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[247 U.S. 189, 190]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit by the Gauley Mountain Coal Company against the Collector to recover taxes alleged to have been unlawfully collected under Corporation Excise Tax Act of August 5, 1909 (chapter 6, 36 Stat. 11, 112,  38). The District Court gave judgment in favor of defendant, which was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (230 Fed. 110, 144 C. C. A. 408), whereupon a writ of certiorari was allowed. The case was submitted together with several other cases decided this day, arising under the same act.\n The agreed facts are in substance as follows: The Company is a mining corporation organized under the laws of the state of West Virginia. The business of trading in stocks is not included among its corporate powers, nor does it appear that, with a single exception, it ever bought or sold any. On December 9, 1902, it purchased certain shares of another mining corporation for $800,000, and sold them October 16, 1911, for $1,010,000, this sum being less by $214,933.33 than the purchase price plus interest at 6 per cent., but greater by $210,000 than cost ignoring interest. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held that a proportion of the $210,000 represented by the ratio of the 1,019 days that elapsed between January 1, 1909, when the Corporation Excise Tax Act became effective, and October 16, 1911, the date of the sale, to the 3,233 days that elapsed between the date of purchase and the date of sale, consitituted income of the corporation for the year 1911 within the meaning of the act. The apportioned sum, $66,189.30, reduced to $52,506 by certain deductions not now in question, was made the basis of an additional assessment at 1 per cent. upon the latter sum; \n\n[247 U.S. 189, 191]\n\u00a0\n and this assessment, having been collected by duress, formed the subject of the present suit.\n The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the principal contentions made by respondent in support of it, are based upon the decision of this court in Gray v. Darlington, 15 Wall. 63. That case arose under the act of Congress of March 2, 1867 (14 Stat. 477, c. 169,  13), which provided that a certain tax should be levied, collected, and paid annually upon the amount over $1,000 of the gains, profits, and income of every person, declaring that 'the tax herein provided for shall be assessed, collected, and paid upon the gains, profits, and income for the year ending the thirty-first of December next preceding the time for levying, collecting, and paying said tax.' There was this further provision, 'That, in estimating the gains, profits, and income of any person, there shall be included all income derived from interest upon notes, bonds, and other securities of the United States; profits realized within the year from sales of real estate purchased within the year or within two years previous to the year for which income is estimated ... all other gains, profits, and income derived from any source whatever,' with an exception that need not be stated. It appeared that plaintiff acquired certain United States bonds in the year 1865 and sold them in 1869 at an advance of $20,000 over their cost, and was taxed upon this amount as gains, profits, and income for the latter year. This court held that by the true construction of the act, except as to gains and profits from trade and commerce and sales of real property, the statute only applied to such gains, profits, and income as were strictly acquisitions made during the year preceding that in which the assessment was levied and collected. We do not regard the decision as controlling, because the language of the act now under consideration is different in material particulars. As pointed out in Doyle, Collector, v. Mitchell Brothers Co., this day decided, \n247 U.S. 179\n 38 Sup. Ct. 467, 62 L. Ed. \n\n[247 U.S. 189, 192]\n\u00a0\n --, it imposes annually a special excise tax with respect to the carrying on or doing business by the corporation 'equivalent to one per centum upon the entire net income over and above five thousand dollars received by it from all sources during such year,' to be ascertained by taking gross income and applying certain exceptions and deductions. 'Gains, profits, and income for the year ending the thirty-first day of December next preceding' (act of 1867) conveys a different meaning from 'the entire net income ...received by it ... during such year' (act of 1909). The former expression, as this court held (15 Wall. 65), denoted 'such gains or profits as may be realized from a business transaction begun and completed during the preceding year,' with the exceptions already mentioned. The expression 'income received during such year,' employed in the act of 1909, looks to the time of realization rather than to the period of accruement, except as the taking effect of the act on a specified date (January 1, 1909), excludes income that accrued before that date. There are other differences upon which we need not dwell.\n As we construe the latter act, it measured the tax by the income received within the year for which the assessment was levied, whether it accrued within that year or in some preceding year while the act was in effect; but it excluded all income that accrued prior to January 1, 1909, although afterwards received while the act was in effect.\n This brings us to consider whether the proceeds of the sale of stock by respondent in October, 1911, included anything, and if so how much, of 'income' accruing on or after January 1, 1909, as the term 'income' is employed in the act.\n That the sale resulted in a gain or profit to the extent of $210,000, the difference between the buying and selling prices, is not to be doubted, for there is no merit in the \n\n[247 U.S. 189, 193]\n\u00a0\n contention that interest should be added to the purchase price in order to ascertain its cost. The money that went into the purchase was not loaned at interest; on the contrary, by the very fact of the purchase it was placed where it could not earn interest for the respondent in the ordinary sense, and the gain represented by the increase of selling price over cost price must be regarded as a substitute for whatever return some other form of investment might have yielded.\n It results that so much of the $210,000 of profits as may be deemed to have accrued subsequent to December 31, 1908, must be treated as a part of the 'gross income' of respondent. For it is the simple case of a conversion of capital assets acquired before and turned into money after the taking effect of the act; and, as we have shown in Doyle, Collector, v. Mitchell Brothers Co., this day decided, since a conversion of capital often results in gain, the general purpose of the act of 1909 to measure the tax by the increase arising from corporate activities together with the income from invested property leads to the inference that that portion of the gross proceeds which represents gain or increase acquired after the taking effect of the act must be regarded as 'gross income'; and to this end it must be distinguished from that portion which represents a return of the capital value existing before. In order to do this, it is necessary to ascertain what was the value of the capital assets on December 31, 1908. Whether this should be done by taking an inventory upon the basis of market values then existing, or whether the entire increment accruing between the time of acquiring and the time of disposing of the assets should be prorated as if it had arisen through a series of gradual and imperceptible augmentations, is a matter of detail, to be settled according to the best evidence obtainable, and in accordance with valid departmental regulations. Treasury Regulations No. 31, December 3, 1909, provided \n\n[247 U.S. 189, 194]\n\u00a0\n for inventories at the beginning and end of each ye r with respect to manufacturing and mercantile companies; and with regard to a sale of capital assets acquired prior to January 1, 1909, and sold thereafter, required that the amount of increment or depreciation representing the difference between the selling and buying prices should be adjusted so as fairly to determine the proportion of the loss or gain arising subsequent to the date mentioned; but without prescribing any particular method of doing this. Subsequent rulings required that sales of stocks and bonds should be regarded as sales of capital assets and accounted for accordingly under Regulations No. 31, and while still requiring inventories, resorted to the prorating method with respect to real estate, apparently on the ground that increases and decreases in the value of this class of property during particular periods could not be accurately determined. T. D. 1106, March 29, 1910, paragraphs 37, 50, 71; T. D. 1675, February 14, 1911, paragraphs 36, 48, 55, 69; T. D. 1742, December 15, 1911, paragraphs 42, 55, 62, 86.\n The present case was heard upon an agreed statement of facts which contains nothing from which the value of the stock at the time the act took effect may be deduced, otherwise than by the prorating method that was adopted; nor is any objection made by the respondent to the application of that method. Hence there is no lawful ground for overthrowing the tax, and the District Court did not err in rendering judgment in favor of the Collector.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOUSTON OIL CO.

Opisso, of Manila, P. I., for appellants.\n Messrs. Charles Cowles Tucker, of Washington, D. C., Frederic R. Coudert and Howard Thayer Kingsbury, both of New York City, and F. C. Fisher, of Manila, P. I., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit by appellants, Joaquin Ibanez de Aldecoa and Zoilo Ibanez de Aldecoa, brought in the Court of First \n\n[246 U.S. 621, 622]\n\u00a0\n Instance of Manila, to have declared null and void a mortgage executed by them in favor of appellees on the ground that when they executed the mortgage they were unemancipated minors.\n After some preliminary procedure and upon answer filed and hearing had, the Court of First Instance dismissed the suit as to Joaquin Ibanez, but granted relief in favor of Zoilo Ibanez. Upon appeal the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands affirmed the judgment so far as it sustained the validity of the mortgage as to Joaquin Ibanez, and reversed it, the judgment, so far as it declared the nullity of the mortgage as to Zoilo Ibanez, and declared the mortgage binding upon the latter; that is, decl red the mortgage valid as to both. This appeal was then prosecuted.\n The facts are not in dispute. The appellants were born in the Islands, their parents being natives of Spain. Their father's domicile was in Manila, where he died October 4, 1895. After his death the firm of Aldecoa & Co., of which he had been a regular member, was reorganized and his widow became one of the general or 'capitalistic' partners of the firm, and she appeared as such in the articles of partnership.\n On July 31, 1903, the mother of the appellants, they then being over the age of 18 years, went before a notary public and executed two instruments wherein and whereby she emancipated them with their consent.\n No guardian of the person or property of appellants has ever been applied for or appointed under the Code of Civil Procedure of the Islands since its promulgation; instead appellants had continued from the death of their father under the custody of their mother until the execution of the instruments of emancipation.\n February 23, 1906, the firm of Aldecoa & Co. was heavily indebted to the appellee bank and the bank was pressing for payment or security. In consequence \n\n[246 U.S. 621, 623]\n\u00a0\n the mortgage, which is the subject of this suit, was executed February 23, 1906. On December 31, 1906, the firm expired by limitation and went into liquidation.\n The question presented is whether the mother of appellants could legally emancipate them and thus confer upon them capacity to execute a valid mortgage of their real property, they consenting. The solution of the question, the Supreme Court said, 'involves an inquiry as to the effect of the provisions of the New Code of Civil Procedure relating to guardianship upon certain provisions of the Civil Code relating to the control by parents over the persons and property of their minor children.'\n In other words, the question in the case turns upon the accommodation or conflict between certain provisions of the Civil Code and certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, the latter being later in enactment. If its provisions did not repeal or supersede the provisions of the other, the mother of appellants had power to emancipate them and their mortgage was a valid instrument. On this question the courts below are in dissonance. The Court of First Instance considered that the codes were irreconcilable and gave a repealing strength to the Code of Civil Procedure. The Supreme Court rejected this conclusion and gave accommodation to the provisions of the codes by excluding those of the Code of Civil Procedure from operation upon parents who had assumed charge of the property of their minor children and were enjoying its usufruct prior to the adoption of that code. In other words, the rights and duties of such parents with respect to their children, including the right of emancipation, continued to be regulated by the Civil Code.\n The court deduced this conclusion from the explicit language of the Civil Code conferring parental authority, the absence of a repealing, or modifying or superseding, word in the Code of Civil Procedure, and the declaration of the latter that guardianships pending at the time of its \n\n[246 U.S. 621, 624]\n\u00a0\n passage should 'proceed in accordance with Spanish law,' with certain exceptions, which emphasized the declaration. It, the declaration, is important, and we therefore quote it. It is section 581 and is as follows:\n'Pending guardianships to proceed in accordance with Spanish law, with certain exceptions. All proceedings in cases of guardianship pending in the Philippine Islands at the time of the passage of this act, shall proceed in accordance with the existing Spanish procedure under which the guardians were appointed: Provided, nevertheless, that any guardian appointed under existing Spanish law may be removed in accordance with the provisions of section 574 of this act, and his successor may be appointed as therein provided, and every successor to a guardian so removed shall, in the administration of the person or estate, or either, as the case may be, of his ward, be governed by the provisions of this act.'\n\n The construction by the Supreme Court is vigorously assailed by appellants. It was so assailed in the Supreme Court and the court answered it and other contentions of appellants by a discussion at once minute and comprehensive. It is not possible to reproduce it or even epitomize it. Its basis is the customs and habits of a people with resulting rights which found expression and sanction in the Civil Code and of which there is no repeal, it was held, or displacement in the Code of Civil Procedure. And the abruptness of the change and disorder of rights which the contentions of appellants involve the court felt and declared.\n The change, if change there was, was certainly abrupt and quite radical. Under the Civil Code parents had general control over the property of their children. 'The father, or, in his absence, the mother, is the legal administrator of the property of the children who are under their authority' (article 159), and by subsequent articles a usufruct in the property was given to the parents. 'Fi- \n\n[246 U.S. 621, 625]\n\u00a0\n liation', the court said, 'stood in lieu of those legal safe-guards' with which the 'Code of Civil Procedure envelops the property of a minor child.' And the court pointed out that there were certain restrictions upon the parent but they 'did not make the parent a guardian.' It was further held that the Civil Code drew a sharp and clearly distinguishable line between guardianship properly so called, and the patria potestas, or parental authority, and confined the former to guardianship contained in article 199 of that Code which defined it as 'the custody of the person and property or only of the property of those who, not being under the parental authority, are incapable of taking care of themselves.'\n It was upon these considerations that the court based its judgment, and if it be granted there are counter considerations of strength we are disposed to defer to the tribunal 'on the spot.' It has support in the principles of our jurisprudence which are repellant to retrospective operation of a law and the repeal by implication of one law by another. These principles have urgency in the present case. The change contended for is not only abrupt but fundamental. It is not change of procedure merely but of systems, disturbing rights, devesting or imposing obligations. Indeed, the present case is an example. The mother of appellants, in confidence of her right to do so, emancipated the appellants, and the appellees in equal confidence accepted it as legal, and that many are in like situation under like confidences may be conjectured.\n It is in effect urged, however, that such disorder was foreseen and accepted as a consequence of existing laws which the legislators with ability and care made a study of, and 'finding the law of guardianship and the law of parental authority, as they stood then, repugnant to the American idea of justice, 'ruthlessly brushed aside' the old order and inaugurated 'the new in the form which had \n\n[246 U.S. 621, 626]\n\u00a0\n withstood the test of time in the United States.\" In other words, displaced the parental authority and all that it meant of power of administration and enjoyment by the parents of the estates of their minor children.\n We concede the care and ability of the legislators but deduce a conclusion different from that of counsel. We are convinced that neither would have been exercised to displace abruptly a system so fixed in the habits and sentiments of a people as parental authority was in the habits of the Islands, and certainly not without explicit declaration, and leave without warning so radical and important a change to be collected from disputable implications. We concur, therefore, with the Supreme Court that section 581, supra, was intended to save 'from the operation of the new act all proceedings in cases of guardianship pending in the Philippine Islands at the time of its passage.' And guardianship and the administration of an estate did not mean, as contended by appellants, something procedural in a court, but they meant what the laws recognized as such and, we have seen, article 159 of the Civil Code provides that 'the father, or, in his absence, the mother, is the legal administrator of the property of the children who are under their authority.' The right is a valuable one and it has as an incident a right as valuable, the usufruct of the estate administered.\n The value and extent of both rights this court has had occasion to declare in Darlington v. Turner, \n202 U.S. 195\n, 230, et seq., 26 Sup. Ct. 630, and in view of that case we are forced to think that, however our habits may induce us to approve the American system of the relation of parent and child and that there should be interposed between them when property interests are involved the order of a court and the security of bonds, there are other peoples-including a state of this Union- who have found that they could rely with confidence on other than material considerations for the performance of duty and that 'filiation' \n\n[246 U.S. 621, 627]\n\u00a0\n could stand in lieu of 'those legal safeguards' with which the new Code of Procedure 'envelops the property of a minor child.'\n There are other contentions of appellants which are either mixed with questions of fact or depend upon an appreciation of local matters and procedure the decision of the local court upon which we accept.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIBANEZ v. HONGKONG & SHANGHAI BANKING CORPORATION(1918)\nNo. 231\nArgued: Decided: April 29, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 627, 628]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Antonio M. Opisso, of Manila, P. I., for appellants.\n Messrs. Charles Cowles Tucker, of Washington, D. C., Frederic R. Coudert and Howard Thayer Kingsbury, both of New York City, and F. C. Fisher, of Manila, P. I., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was submitted with No. 230, just decided. \n246 U.S. 621\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 410, 62 L. Ed. --. It was brought in the Court of First Instance of Manila to foreclose, among other purposes, the mortgage which that suit was brought to declare void. The defense in this case of Joaquin Ibanez and Zoilo Ibanez is based on the same ground that they alleged as a cause of action in the other case; that is, that the mortgage is a nullity because they were unemancipated minors when it was executed. This contention and the facts and legal propositions relevant to it are set out in No. 230 and need not be repeated. It was there decided that their emancipation was complete and legal, and the mortgage executed by them therefore valid, the Civil Code providing for such emancipation not having been repealed or superseded by the Code of Civil Precedure-this being the basic contention.\n Other defenses are, however, set up which were more or less mingled with defenses of other parties to the suit who are not here. Those special to Joaquin and Zoilo Ibanez were, as separated by the Supreme Court: (1) The pendency of another suit; and (2) a former judgment.\n\n 1. \nUnder this it was urged that the suit for the annulling of the mortgage (case No. 230) had been submitted for adjudication and had not been disposed of. Identity was hence asserted between the two actions, and it was insisted that the second should have awaited the disposition of the first. The Supreme Court took a \n\n[246 U.S. 627, 629]\n\u00a0\n different view, urged thereto by cases which it cited. But counsel say that if the mortgage had been declared null in the first action (No. 230) it could not have been foreclosed in the second (that at bar), as it would have encountered the plea of res judicata. If, however, the mortgage had been upheld in the first action the appellants would have been precluded from attacking it in the second. That the alternatives would have occurred may be conceded; one of them, indeed, has occurred and has demonstrated that appellants suffered no detriment from the ruling.\n The appellant Isabel Palet assigns as error that the Supr me Court failed to hold (1) that her liability as surety of Aldecoa & Co. had been extinguished in accordance with the provisions of article 1851 of the Civil Code, which provides that 'the extension granted to a debtor by the creditor, without the consent of the surety, extinguishes the security'; ( 2) refused to order for her benefit that the property of the company should be exhausted before resort be had to her property for satisfaction of the bank's claim.\n It will be observed at once that the defenses have some dependence upon questions of fact upon which the two courts below concurred. From article 1851 of the Civil Code, abstractly considered, nothing can be deduced. Both the trial and Supreme Courts held that 'the mere failure to bring an action upon a credit, as soon as the same or any part of it matures, does not constitute an extension of the term of the obligation.' And it was further held that the extension, to produce the extinction of the liability, 'must be based on some new agreement by which the creditor deprives himself of the right to immediately enforce the claim.' This interpretation of the local courts of the local law we defer to. The construction, moreover, expresses the rule that obtains in other jurisdictions. \n\n[246 U.S. 627, 630]\n\u00a0\n As to the other assignment of error the court replied that Isabel Palet did not deny that as a member of the firm of Aldecoa & Co. she was liable with the company and that besides the trial court had directed that the mortgaged properties, including the properties mortgaged by her, should be sold under foreclosure in the event the company should not pay into court the amount of the judgment within the time designated for the purpose.\n Counsel for appellee, however, admits that by clerical error, the judgment is made to run 'against the company and Isabel Palet jointly and severally and does in terms express the subsidiary character' of her liability, and he therefore does not oppose a modification of the judgment to conform to the opinion of the trial court, that is, 'that save as regards the foreclosure of the mortgage no execution shall issue against Isabel Palet until after the exhaustion of the assets of the principal debtor [the company]-which, by the way,' counsel adds, 'is a mere formality, as there are no such assets available, Aldecoa & Co. being notoriously insolvent, as stated by the Supreme Court in its decision.' Opposing counsel may not be of this opinion, and we therefore modify the judgment as indicated, and, as modified, it is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nILLINOIS CENT. R.

The facts and proceedings to be considered are these: The Mississippi river forms the boundary between the states of Missouri and Iowa on the west and the state of Illinois on the east. East St. Louis, in southwestern Illinois, is directly across the river from St. Louis, Mo., and Hamilton, in western Illinois, is directly across the river from Keokuk, Iowa. At both places the river is spanned by railroad bridges whereby the lines of railroad on one side are connected with those on the other. For some years prior to December 1, 1914, interstate passenger rates between St. Louis and Keokuk on the one hand and points in Illinois on the other were on a \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 495]\n\u00a0\n substantial parity with intrastate rates between East St. Louis and Hamilton, respectively, and points in Illinois. All were on a basis of 2 cents per mile, save that the rates to and from St. Louis and Keokuk included a bridge toll over the river. All other rates between points in Illinois were also on the same basis, any intrastate rate in excess of 2 cents per mile being prohibited by a statute of that state. On December 1, 1914, the rates between St. Louis and Keokuk, respectively, and points in Illinois were increased by the carriers to 2 1\/2 cents per mile, plus bridge tolls, the parity theretofore existing being thereby broken. Following this increase the Business Men's League of St. Louis, a corporate body of that city engaged in fostering its interests, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission a petition against the carriers charging that the rates between St. Louis and points in Illinois were unreasonable in themselves, and, in connection with the lower intrastate rates, worked an unreasonable discrimination against St. Louis and in favor of Illinois cities, particularly East St. Louis and Chicago, and a like discrimination against interstate passenger traffic to and from St. Louis and in favor of intrastate passenger traffic to and from East St. Louis and Chicago. An association representing interests in Keokuk, Iowa, intervened and urged that any relief granted with respect to St. Louis be extended to Keokuk, so the former would not have an undue advantage over the latter. The state of Illinois, the Public Utilities Commission of that state, an association representing interests in Chicago and another association representing interests in East St. Louis, also intervened and opposed any action contemplating or requiring an increase in intrastate rates. After a hearing, in which all the parties and intervenors participated, the Interstate Commerce Commission filed a report (41 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 13) finding that the existing bridge tolls at St. Louis and Keokuk were unobjectionable, that rates between \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 496]\n\u00a0\n either of those cities and points in Illinois were reasonable when not in excess of 2.4 cents per mile, plus bridge tolls, and that the service, equipment and accommodations provided for intrastate passengers to and from East St. Louis, Hamilton, and Chicago, were the same as those provided for interstate passengers to and from St. Louis and Keokuk. In that report the Commission also found that the contemporaneous maintenance between East St. Louis1 and Hamilton2 respectively, and other points in Illinois, of rates on a lower basis than those maintained via the same routes between St. Louis and Keokuk, respectively, and the same points in Illinois, bridge tolls excepted, gave an undue preference to East St. Louis and Hamilton and to intrastate passenger traffic to and from the latter points and subjected St. Louis and Keokuk and interstate passenger traffic to and from those cities to an unreasonable disadvantage; that the existing disparity in interstate and intrastate rates worked an unjust discrimination against St. Louis and in favor of Chicago in so far as the rates between St. Louis and points in Illinois approximately equidistant from those cities exceeded, by more than the bridge toll, the rates between Chicago and the same points; that the disparity worked a like discrimination against Keokuk and in favor of Chicago; and that the existence on the reasonably direct lines of the carriers in the territory between Chicago on the one hand and St. Louis and Keokuk on the other of intrastate rates on a lower basis per mile than the rates between that territory and St. Louis and Keokuk, bridge tolls excepted, operated to subject interstate traffic to an unreasonable disadvantage. \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 497]\n\u00a0\n The Commission then made an order intended to result in the installation of rates not exceeding 2.4 cents per mile between St. Louis and Keokuk, respectively, and points in Illinois and to remove the discrimination shown in the report; but shortly thereafter the Commission recalled that order and filed a supplemental report (41 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 503) indicating that lawful interstate rates between St. Louis and Keokuk on the one hand and Illinois point on the other could be defeated by the use of two tickets, one purchased at the interstate rate for a part of the journey and the other at the lower intrastate rate for the remainder, and therefore that the order should be so framed as to cover the rates between the intermediate points. In this connection it was said that the discrimination against interstate traffic resulting from the lower intrastate rates \"would not be removed merely by an increase in the intrastate fares to and from the east bank points,\" and that \"any contemporaneous adjustments of fares between St. Louis or Keokuk and points in Illinois, and generally within Illinois, which would permit the defeat of the St. Louis, Keokuk, East St. Louis, or any other east side city fares by methods such as described above, and which would thereby permit the continuance of the undue prejudice which we have found is suffered by St. Louis and Keokuk, and continue to burden interstate commerce,\" would not comply with the order about to be copied in the margin. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[245 U.S. 493, 498]\n\u00a0\n In obedience to that order the carriers-of whom there were 29-took the requisite steps to establish and put in force interstate rates on a basis of 2.4 cents per mile between St. Louis and Keokuk, respectively, and points in Illinois, and those rates became effective. Then, \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 499]\n\u00a0\n believing the order required all intrastate rates in Illinois to be on a level with those interstate rates, bridge tolls excepted, the carriers proceeded to establish and put in force new rates between all points in that state on a basis of 2.4 cents per mile. This met with opposi- \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 500]\n\u00a0\n tion on the part of the state authorities and the carriers severally brought suits against them, in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, to enjoin them from interfering, by civil or criminal proceedings, or otherwise, with the establishment and maintenance of such intrastate rates under the Commission's order. \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 501]\n\u00a0\n The suits were consolidated and the present appeals are from decrees dismissing the bills for want of equity and dismissing cross-bills of the state authorities for want of jurisdiction.\n Messrs. Silas H. Strawn, Robert Bruce Scott, Andrew P. Humburg, W. S. horton,\n Messrs. George T. Buckingham, James H. for Railroad Cos.\n Messrs. George T. Buckingham, James H. Wilkerson, and Edward J. Brundage, all of Chicago, Ill., for State Public Utilities Commission.\n Mr. Joseph W. Folk, of Washington, D. C., for Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, of Washington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 502]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The questions to which attention is first invited relate to the power of the District Court in the Northern District of Illinois to entertain the suits and the cross-bills, in view of the jurisdictional provision in the Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 219, that a suit 'to enforce, suspend or set aside, in whole or in part,' an order of the Commission relating to transportation and made upon petition may be brought only in the district 'wherein is the residence of the party or any of the parties upon whose petition the order was made.'\n It was objected in the District Court that the suits were brought to enforce the Commission's order and therefore could be entertained only in the Eastern district of Missouri, which embraces the residence of the party upon whose petition the order was made. But the court sustained its jurisdiction, ruling that the suits were not of the nature indicated by the objection.\n In common acceptation a suit to enforce an order of the Commission is one which seeks to compel the carrier to whom the order is directed to yield obedience to its command. Nothing in the jurisdictional provision suggests that this is not what is intended, and that it is shown by the provision in section 16 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended by Act June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 554, that, if an order respecting transpor ation be not obeyed by the carrier, the same may be enforced at the suit of the Commission, an injured party, or the United States, by an appropriate writ of process restraining the carrier from further disobedience and enjoining upon it due compliance with the order. A reading of both provisions leaves no room to doubt that the suit to enforce so clearly outlined in one is the suit intended by the other. \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 503]\n\u00a0\n But these were not suits of that type. They were begun by the carriers, not against them, and proceeded upon the theory, not that the carriers were in default, but that they were proceeding to obey the order. What was alleged and sought to be enjoined was threatened action on the part of the defendants, the state authorities, whereby obedience on the part of the carriers would be obstructed and made the occasion for subjecting them to divers criminal proceedings, suits for penalties and the like. In other words, the suits were brought to prevent complete obedience by the carriers from being wrongfully obstructed and embarrassed, but not to enforce the order in the sense of the jurisdictional provision. Therefore that provision was not applicable to them. They properly came within the provision in section 1 of the Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, repeated in Judicial Code,  207, which preserves and continues the general jurisdiction of the District Courts over cases and proceedings not therein enumerated.\n At this point it will be convenient to dispose of another objection relating to the principal suits, but not turning on the jurisdictional provision. Shortly after the carriers' bills were filed the court, acting upon a motion of the defendants, ruled that the United States and the Commission were necessary parties, ordered that they be made defendants, and directed the issue of process against them. After they were thus brought in, the matter was considered again and the bills were dismissed as to them for want of jurisdiction. The defendants now say that after this dismissal the court did not have before it the requisite parties to enable it to entertain the bills. But the point is not tenable. There was no statute making the United States or the Commission a necessary party to bills of that nature, nor was the relief sought such as to render the presence of either essential under the rules applicable to suits in equity. \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 504]\n\u00a0\n It well may be that either or both, if desiring to intervene, would have been permitted to do so, but there is no warrant for thinking that without their presence the bills could not be entertained.\n The cross-bills assailed the validity of the Commission's order on various grounds and concluded with a prayer that it be set aside and annulled and that the United States and the Commission be enjoined from enforcing it and the carriers from complying with it. Passing the fact that they were presented as cross-bills, it is apparent that in subject- matter and purpose they were suits to set aside the order. By statute such suits are required to be brought against the United States (Judicial Code ,  208, 211, 38 Stat. 219, 220, c. 32), and the jurisdictional provision before mentioned permits them to be brought only in designated districts. Here the Eastern district of Missouri was the one designated, the order being one that was made upon the petition of a resident of that district. The United States had consented to be sued there, but not elsewhere, and, being suitable only by its consent, could not be sued in a district not within the consent given. See Finn v. United States, \n123 \nU.S. 227, 232\n, 233 S., 8 Sup. Ct. 82; Schillinger v. United States, \n155 \nU.S. 163, 166\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 85. It therefore is certain that the cross-bills could not be entertained in the Northern district of Illinois, unless in this regard there be, as is asserted, a valid distinction between a cross-bill and an original bill. No doubt there are situations in which a cross-bill against an ordinary suitor may be co sidered and dealt with in virtue of the jurisdiction over the principal suit, even though as an original bill it could not be entertained (see Denver v. New York Trust Co., \n229 \nU.S. 123, 135\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 657, and cases cited); but it is otherwise where the cross-bill is against the United States, for no suit against it can be brought without its consent given by law. Its immunity recognizes no distinction between cross- \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 505]\n\u00a0\n bills and original bills, or between ancillary suits and original suits, but extends to suits of every class. United States v. McLemore, 4 How. 286; Hill v. United States, 9 How. 386; Reeside v. Walker, 11 How. 272, 290; De Groot v. United States, 5 Wall. 419, 431-433; Carr v. United States, \n98 U.S. 433\n, 437; Belknap v. Schild, \n161 \nU.S. 10, 16\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 443. Thus the cross-bills as such had no better standing than they would have had as original bills.\n The claim is made that in any event the cross-bills should have been retained as to the defendants therein other than the United States. But this is not an admissible view. As before indicated, the United States is made by statute a necessary party to a suit to set aside an order of the Commission, and this means that it is to stand in judgment as representing the public. If the state authorities thought the order should be set aside and wished to test their right to affirmative relief along that line they should have resorted to the court empowered by law to entertain a suit of that nature.\n It follows that the District Court rightly disposed of the jurisdictional questions by entertaining the principal suits and declining to entertain the cross-bills.\n Whether the suits by the carriers were rightly dismissed on the merits is the principal question, and its solution turns on the power of the Commission to deal with discrimination arising out of a disparity in interstate and intrastate rates, and on the scope and effect of the order made.\n In their answers the state authorities took the position that in so far as the order purports to authorize or require a removal of the discrimination found to exist by a change in intrastate rates it is in excess of any power that has been or can be conferred on the Commission, and therefore neither relieves the carriers from full compliance with the state rate law nor prevents that law from being fully enforced against them. If \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 506]\n\u00a0\n the premise were sound the conclusion doubtless would follow, for where the Commission makes an order which it has no power to make the order is necessarily void, not merely voidable. But that the premise is not sound is settled by the Shreveport case (Houston, East & West Texas Ry. Co. v. United States) \n234 U.S. 342\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 833. Upon full consideration it there was held:\n\n 1. \nUnder the commerce clause of the Constitution Congress has ample power to prevent the common instrumentalities of interstate and intrastate commerce, such as the railroads, from being used in their intrastate operations in such manner as to affect injuriously traffic which is interstate.\n\n 2. \nWhere unjust discrimination against interstate commerce arises out of the relation of intrastate to interstate rates this power may be exerted to remove the discrimination, and this whether the intrastate rates are maintained under a local statute or by the voluntary act of the carrier.\n\n 3. \nIn correcting such discrimination Congress is not restricted to an adjustment or reduction of the interstate rates, but may prescribe a reasonable standard to which they shall conform and require the carrier to adjust the intrastate rates in such way as to remove the discrimination; for where the interstate and intrastate transactions of carriers are so related that the effective regulation of one involves control of the other, it is Congress, and not the state, that is entitled to prescribe the dominant rule.\n\n 4. \nIt is admissible for Congress to provide for the execution of this power through a subordinate body such as the Interstate Commerce Commission, and this it has done by the Act to Regulate Commerce.\n\n 5. \nWhere in the exercise of its delegated authority the Commission not only finds that a disparity in the two classes of rates is resulting in unjust discrimination \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 507]\n\u00a0\n against interstate commerce but also determines what are reasonable rates for the interstate traffic, and then directs the removal of the discrimination, the carrier not only is entitled to put in force the interstate rates found reasonable but is free to remove the forbidden discrimination by bringing the intrastate rates to the same level.\n Upon further consideration that decision was approved and followed in American Express Co. v. Caldwell, \n244 U.S. 617\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 656. 61 L. Ed. 1352. db\n\n[245 U.S. 493, 8]\n\u00a0\n The parties differ widely about the scope of the order. The carriers assert that it covers every intrastate passenger rate in Illinois, is addressed to the removal of discrimination found to be state-wide, and gives ample authority for increasing all rates between points in Illinois from 2 cents to 2.4 cents per mile. On the other hand, the state authorities assert that it is not state-wide and that the extent to which it is intended to affect the state-made rates is so indefinitely and vaguely stated as to make it inoperative and of no effect as to them. Of course, the Commission could adjust the remedy to the evil and make the order as broad as the wrongful discrimination; and not improbably it would intend to go that far and no farther. But the extent of the discrimination found and of the remedy applied must be gathered from the reports and order of the Commission, for they constitute the only authoritative evidence of its action. The reports show that the only discrimination found relates to the passenger traffic between Illinois and two cities outside that state-St. Louis and Keokuk. There is no finding that this traffic extends in appreciable volume to all sections of Illinois. As to some sections its volume may be very large and as to others almost or quite negligible. At best the reports leave the matter uncertain. Obviously this traffic is only a small part of the interstate passenger traffic moving over \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 508]\n\u00a0\n the railroads in Illinois, and yet the finding is merely that there was discrimination against this part. Had the Commission regarded the discrimination as state-wide it is but reasonable to believe that it would have said so in its findings. And had it intended to require or authorize a state-wide readjustment of the intrastate rates it doubtless would have given direct expression to that purpose, which easily could have been done in a few lines. But neither in any part nor as a whole does the order plainly manifest such a purpose. In harmony with the reports it deals with the intrastate rates in so far only as they result in discrimination against interstate traffic to and from St. Louis and Keokuk. Its most comprehensive paragraph-the next to the last-declares that the carriers must 'abstain from the undue preferences and the undue and unreasonable prejudices and disadvantages found in said report to result from the contemporaneous maintenance between Illinois points of passenger fares, which fares, in combination with other fares required or permitted by this order, would produce the discrimination against interstate commerce and the undue preference in favor of intrastate commerce condemned in the report of the Commission.' But even here the general terms are so far restrained by the reference to the reports as to show that nothing more is intended than to command the removal of the discrimination to which the traffic to and from St. Louis and Keokuk is subjected. Besides, this paragraph evidently proceeds upon the theory that some of the intrastate rates are not affected by the other paragraphs, and ought not to be disturbed save where their use in connection with rates sanctioned by the order will be productive of the iscrimination which it is intended to correct.\n But while the order shows that it is not intended to require or authorize a readjustment of all the intrastate \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 509]\n\u00a0\n rates, the description of those to which it applies is at best indefinite. There may be less uncertainty in some parts of the order than in others, but when each is read in the light of the rest and all in the light of the reports it is apparent that none has a certain or definite field of operation. The uncertainty arises out of a failure to designate with appropriate precision the territory or points to and from which the intrastate rates must or may be readjusted, and this omission accords with the absence from the reports of any finding showing definitely the territory or points where those rates operate prejudicially against the interstate traffic which the order is intended to protect.\n To be effective in respect of intrastate rates established and maintained under state authority an order of the Commission of the kind now under consideration must have a definite field of operation and not leave the territory or points to which it applies uncertain. Upon this point we said in American Express Co. v. Caldwell, supra, \n244 U.S. 625\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 660:\n'Where a proceeding to remove unjust discrimination presents solely the question whether the carrier has improperly exercised its authority to initiate rates, the Commission may legally order, in general terms, the removal of the discrimination shown, leaving upon the carrier the burden of determining also the points to and from which rates must be changed, in order to effect a removal of the discrimination. But where, as here, there is a conflict between the federal and the state authorities, the Commission's order cannot serve as a justification for disregarding a regulation or order issued under state authority, unless, and except so far as, it is definite as to the territory or points to which it applies. For the power of the Commission is dominant only to the extent that the exercise is found by it to be necessary to remove the existing discrimination against interstate traffic.' \n\n[245 U.S. 493, 510]\n\u00a0\n In construing federal statutes enacted under the power conferred by the commerce clause of the Constitution the rule is that it should never be held that Congress intends to supersede or suspend the exercise of the reserved powers of a state, even where that may be done, unless, and except so far as, its purpose to do so is clearly manifested. Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137, 148\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 92; Cummings v. Chicago, \n188 \nU.S. 410, 430\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 472; Savage v. Jones, \n225 U.S. 501\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 715; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Harris, \n234 \nU.S. 412, 419\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 790, L. R. A. 1915E, 942. This being true of an act of Congress, it is obvious that an order of a subordinate agency, such as the Commission, should not be given precedence over a state rate statute otherwise valid, unless, and except so far as, it conforms to a high standard of certainty.\n\n We conclude that the uncertainty in this order is such as to render it inoperative and of no effect as to the intrastate rates, established and maintained under a law of the state, and therefore that the suits by the carriers were rightly dismissed on the merits.\n Decrees affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The report similarly speaks of other towns across the river from St. Louis, East St. Louis being here mentioned as representative of all. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The report refers to a plurality of points opposite Keokuk, but it suffices here to mention Hamilton. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The order is dated October 17, 1916, and, omitting the caption, reads as follows:\n'It appearing, that on July 12, 1916, the Commission entered its report and order in this proceeding, and on the date hereof a supplemental report, which reports are hereby referred to and made a part hereof:\n\n'It is ordered that the said order of July 12, 1916, be, and it is hereby, vacated, and that the following be substituted therefor.\n\n'It is further ordered, that the above-named defendants, according as they participate in the transportation, be, and they are hereby, notified and required to cease and desist, on or before January 15, 1917, and thereafter to abstain, from publishing, demanding, or collecting passenger fares between St. Louis, Mo., and points in Illinois upon a basis higher than 2.4 cents per mile, bridge tolls excepted, which basis was found reasonable in said report, or higher than the fares contemporaneously exacted for the transportation of passengers between East St. Louis, Ill., and the same Illinois points, by more than a reasonable bridge toll; or fares constructed upon a higher basis per mile, bridge tolls excepted, than fares contemporaneously maintained between Illinois points intermediate between St. Louis, Mo., and points in Illinois, as such fares have been found in said report to be unlawfully discriminatory. \n\n'It is further ordered, that the above defendants, according as they participate in the transportation, be, and they are hereby, notifled and required to cease and desist, on or before January 15, 1917, and thereafter to abstain, from publishing, demanding, or collecting fares for the transportation of passengers between St. Louis Mo., and points in Illinois, the basis of which per mile, bridge tolls excepted, is higher than the basis per mile for fares contemporaneously maintained between Chicago and the same Illinois points, as such fares have been found in said report to be unlawfully discriminatory.\n\n'It is further ordered, that the above-named defendants, according as they participate in the transportation, be, and they are hereby, notified and required to cease and desist, on or before January 15, 1917, and thereafter to abstain, from publishing, demanding, or collecting passenger fares between Keokuk, Iowa and points in Illinois upon a basis higher than 2.4 cents per mile, bridge tolls excepted, which basis was found reasonable in said report, or higher per mile than the fares contemporaneously exacted for the transportation of passengers between Illinois points, directly opposite Keokuk and the same Illinois points, by more than a reasonable bridge toll; or fares constructed upon a higher basis per mile, bridge tolls excepted, than fares contemporaneously maintained between Illinois points intermediate between Keokuk, Iowa, and points in Illinois, as such fares have been found in said report to be unlawfully discriminatory. \n\n'It is further ordered, that the above-named defendants, according as they participate in the transportation, be, and they are hereby, notified and required to cease and desist, on or before January 15, 1917, and thereafter to abstain, from publishing, demanding, or collecting fares for the transportation of passengers between Keokuk, Iowa, and points in Illinois, the basis of which per mile, bridge tolls excepted, is higher than the basis per mile for fares contemporaneously maintained between Chicago and the same Illinois points, as such fares have been found in said report to be unlawfully discriminatory.\n\n'It is further ordered, that the above-named defendants, according as they participate in the transportation, be, and they are hereby, notified and required to establish and put in force on or before January 15, 1917, upon notice to this Commission and to the general public by not less than 30 days' filing and posting in the manner prescribed in section 6 of the Act to Regulate Commerce [Comp.

The court was asked to direct the clerk to do otherwise, but for reasons stated in a brief memorandum (The Nigretia, 249 Fed. 348) it refused to do so. Assuming that this action was based solely on the view that the act of 1916 had ceased to be operative by limitation of time, relying upon the act of 1917, the request for direction to the clerk to file the record without costs or security for the same was again made to the court and refused upon the ground of want of merit in the application, that is, upon the conclusion that the act of Congress relied upon did not relieve seamen from costs in appellate courts. Leave to present a petition for mandamus against the clerk to compel him to file the record without costs was then here granted and the matter is before us on the submission of the rule to show cause consequent upon such permission and the answer of the clerk to the rule setting out the action of the court, in which answer reliance is placed upon the orders of the court which are appended and the two opinions expressed by the court on the subject.\n The existence of ultimate discretionary power here to review the cause on its merits and the deterrent influence which the refusal to file must have upon the practical exertion of that power in a case properly made gives the authority to consider the subject which the rule presents. \n1\n But that does not without more dispel the seeming con- \n\n[247 U.S. 27, 29]\n\u00a0\n fusion resulting from the fact that the remedy prayed is directed not to the court below but to its clerk and hence in form the relief sought is a mandamus to direct the clerk to disobey the order of the court, leaving the order unreviewed and unreversed. The incongruity is obvious and we cannot as a general rule sanction it. Looking, however, through form to the essence of things, as no mere independent action of the clerk as clerk is involved, but the authority exe ted by the court in directing the action of the clerk complained of is the subject-matter at issue and is the only justification relied upon by the clerk in the answer to the rule, we are of the opinion that in the exercise of a sound discretion we may treat the case from that point of view, that is to say, under the circumstances consider the authority to have made the order with the clerk alone as a technical party to the proceeding.\n The contention that the court mistakenly refused to permit the appellate proceedings to be conducted without payment of costs is based upon a provision in the Appropriation Act of June 12, 1917, as follows:\n'Provided, that courts of the United States shall be open to seamen, without furnishing bonds, or prepayment of or making deposit to secure fees or costs, for the purpose of entering and prosecuting suit or suits in their own name and for their own benefit for wages or salvage and to enforce laws made for their health and safety.'\n\n The provision does not in express words relate to appellate proceedings and the whole argument advanced to sustain the theory that it includes such proceedings rests upon the conception that because the provision was intended to benefit seamen by giving them access to the courts without cost, therefore by necessary implication the statute should be construed as all-embracing, that is, as giving the right to carry on appellate proceedings free from costs. But this simply assumes the proposition contended for and after all comes but to the contention \n\n[247 U.S. 27, 30]\n\u00a0\n that because the statute gives the right which is asserted therefore the statute should be construed as conferring it and its enjoyment consequently sustained. The error results from disregarding the broad distinction which exists between the right to be heard in courts of justice on the one hand and the necessity for the grant of authority on the other to review the results of such hearing by proceedings in error or appeal. Reetz v. Michigan, \n188 U.S. 505\n, 507-508, 23 Sup. Ct. 390; United States v. Heinze, \n218 U.S. 532\n, 545-546, 31 Sup. Ct. 98, 21 Ann. Cas. 884; Lott v. Pittman, \n243 \nU.S. 588, 591\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 473. This obvious distinction between the two we are of opinion in the absence of a clear and express legislative direction to the contrary excludes the possibility of giving the statute the all- embracing construction sought to be applied to it. And the correctness of this opinion is we think conclusively illustrated by a consideration of prior statutes dealing with a somewhat cognate subject and the decisions concerning the same. Act July 20, 1892, c. 209, 27 Stat. 252 (Comp. St. 1916,  1626-1630); Act June 25, 1910, c. 435, 36 Stat. 866 (Comp. St. 1916,  1626); Bradford v. Southern Railway Co., \n195 U.S. 243\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 55; Kinney v. Plymouth Rock Squab Co., \n236 U.S. 43\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 236. In other words, under the act of 1892 conferring a right to prosecute in forma pauperis suits in courts of the United States, which was certainly as broad in its language as the one now under consideration, it was decided in the Bradford Case that the right did not embrace appellate proceedings. And when following that decision the statute was amended by the act of 1910 so as to cause it in express terms to be applicable to appellate proceedings, the right was subjected to accompanying restrictions and safeguards which as held in the Kinney Case made the new right not absolute, but dependent not only upon the limitations which were otherwise put in the statute but also upon the exercise of a sound discretion by the appellate court. The statute before us, as we have seen, which was enacted in 1917 after the decision in the Bradford Case, contains none of the ex- \n\n[247 U.S. 27, 31]\n\u00a0\n press provisions as to appellate proceedings inserted in the act of 1910. Thus if resort is to be had to legislative history and the implication of legislative intent as a means of reading into the statute that which it does not contain, a contrary result must necessarily follow, since the conclusion from considering that subject must be that the act of 1917 enacted after the Bradford Case in not expressing the right to be exempt from costs in appellate proceedings was intended to conform and give effect to the rule announced in the Bradford Case.\n Rule discharged.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n I am unable to concur in the decision of the court. Congress declared without qualification: 'That courts of the United States shall be open to seamen ... for purpose of entering and prosecuting suit ... without ... making deposit to secure fees or costs.' There being no qualification, the words, 'courts of the United States' mean all the courts in which seamen may have occasion to enter and prosecute suits. Seamen have occasion to enter and prosecute such suits in appellate courts. Consequently they should be permitted to do so 'without making deposit to secure fees or costs.'\n Mr. Justice CLARKE joins in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ex parte Crane, 5 Pet. 190, 193, 194; Chateaugay Iron Co., Petitioner, \n128 U.S. 544\n, 9 Sup.

Brackett, of Saratoga Springs, N. Y., for respondent.\n\n\n[247 U.S. 231, 238]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a petition for mandamus, or, if that is denied, for prohibition or certiorari, to the District Court for the Southern District of New York upon the following facts: The petitioner brought an action in two counts against the executors of a widow named Frank Leslie. The first count alleged a promise by Mrs. Leslie that if the plaintiff would perform certain personal services of attendance and care to her, she would bequeath to the plaintiff $50,000. It set forth the performance of the services in great detail, alleged the death of Mrs. Leslie and probate of her will, the bequest to the plaintiff of not more than $10,000, and claimed $40,000 with interest from one year after the death of the testatrix, as damages. The second count repeats by reference the averments of the first count, but alleges a promise to pay the reasonable value of the plaintiff's services, set at $50,000 of which $10,000 have been satisfied by legacy, and claims damages as before. On motion of the defendants the judge sitting to hear motions in the District Court ordered the first cause of action to be transferred to the equity side of the Court and docketed as an equity cause, and to be stricken out of the complaint in the action at law, but only for the purpose of transfer, allowing the plaintiff to amend, etc. The ground disclosed was that by the law of New York the \n\n[247 U.S. 231, 239]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff could not sustain the first cause of action at law.\n We do not find sufficient ground for the opinion of the judge in the New York decisions. No doubt alleged contracts to make a provision by will must be approached with great caution in the matter of proof, but there is no doubt that if proved they are valid so far as no statute intervenes. So much seems to be assumed by the order of the judge, and is the law we believe of New York as well as of other states and England. But if valid we see no reason why a contract to bequeath a certain sum should not give rise to an action for damages if broken, as certainly as a contract to pay the same sum in the contractor's life, or at the moment of the contractor's death. Parker v. Coburn, 10 Allen, 82. In cases of contracts to leave all the testator's property, including land, or a proportion of a residue requiring an account to ascertain it, equitable remedies have been thought proper, and in some such cases it has been assumed for the purposes of argument that an action would not lie at common law. See Winne v. Winne, 166 N. Y. 263, 59 N. E. 832, 82 Am. St. Rep. 647; Phalen v. United States Trust Co., 186 N. Y. 178, 78 N. E. 943, 7 L. R. A. (N. S.) 734, 9 Ann. Cas. 595. But we have seen nothing that suggests an arbitrary departure by the Courts of New York from the common law in cases like the present. See Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Mortimer, 219 N. Y. 290, 295, 114 N. E. 389; De Cicco v. Schweizer, 221 N. Y. 431, 117 N. E. 807; Silvester's Case, Popham, 148, 2 Roll. R. 104; Fenton v. Emblers, 3 Burr. 1279; Van Houten v. Van Houten, 89 N. J.

St. Rep. 260.\n If we are right, the order was wrong and deprived the plaintiff of her right to a trial by jury. It is an order that should be dealt with now, before the plaintiff is put to the difficulties and the courts to the inconvenience that would be raised by a severance that ultimately must be held to have been required under a mistake. It does not \n\n[247 U.S. 231, 240]\n\u00a0\n matter very much in what form an extraordinary remedy is afforded in this case. But as the order may be regarded as having repudiated jurisdiction of the first count, mandamus may be adopted to require the District Court to proceed and to give the plaintiff her right to a trial at common law.

Campbell, both of Palestine, Tex., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 424, 428]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the defendants in error to prevent the Railroad Company, plaintiff in error, from moving its machine shops, roundhouses, and general offices from the City of Palestine and from maintaining any of them elsewhere. An injunction was issued as prayed; the judgment was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals, 174 S. W. 305, in accordance with intimations of the Supreme Court of Texas at an earlier stage, 106 Tex. 60, 156 S. W. 499, and an application to the latter Court for a writ of error was refused. The case is brought here upon voluminous assignments of error which may be summed up in the propositions that the State Court was without jurisdiction because of certain foreclosures in the Courts of the United States, that the judgment disregarded rights secured by the decrees of those Courts, and that it gave effect to a statute which as applied burdened interstate commerce, impaired the obligation of contracts, etc., and was contrary to Article 1, Sections 8 and 10, and to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n The facts begin with the predecessors of the plaintiffs in error. The Houston & Great Northern Railroad Company, a local road, was chartered by a special Act \n\n[246 U.S. 424, 429]\n\u00a0\n on October 26, 1866. About March 15, 1872, it contracted with the citizens of Palestine in the County of Anderson in consideration of the issue of bonds by the county to maintain its general offices, machine shops and round houses at that place. The International Railroad Company was chartered in like manner on August 5, 1870. In 1872 the two companies agreed to consolidate and this agreement was ratified by the stockholders of each in 1873. A special Act of April 24, 1874, authorized the consolidated company, known as the International & Great Northern Railroad Company, to issue bonds secured by mortgage and provided that all acts theretofore done in the name of either of the companies should be of the same binding effect upon the new one that they were upon the old. In 1875 the new company in consideration of the erection of houses for its employes renewed the contract of the Houston & Great Northern and at about the same time it resolved that its general offices should be removed to Palestine. We see no reason for reopening the findings below that the alleged contracts were made. The offices were removed and there they remained, subject to some immaterial interruption, until 1911. The machine shops and roundhouses are still there. Each of the two constituent companies had executed mortgages before the date of the original agreement of the Houston & Great Northern and each executed another before the contract of the consolidated company in 1875. These mortgages were all foreclosed in 1879 and the property conveyed to a corporation, still called the International & Great Northern Railroad Company, by a deed that conveyed all the franchises and chartered powers of the original roads. The foreclosure is one fact relied upon for the defence.\n The purchasing company in its turn executed mortgages, one of which, including, like the earlier ones that we have mentioned, the franchise to be a corporation, \n\n[246 U.S. 424, 430]\n\u00a0\n dated in 1881, is the source of the plaintiff in error's title, by a foreclosure in 1910-1911. Before this last foreclosure took place two statutes were enacted in Texas that are important. The first, known as the Office-Shops Act, approved March 27, 1889, c. 106, Rev. Civil Stat. 1911, art. 6423, provided that every railroad company chartered by the State or owning or operating a line within the State should permanently maintain its general offices at the place named in its charter, and if no certain place were named there, at such place as it should have contracted to locate them, otherwise at such place as it should designate; also that it should maintain its machine shops and round houses at the place where it had contracted to keep them, and that if the offices, shops or round houses were located on the line of a railroad in a county that had aided such railroad by an issue of bonds in consideration of the location being made, then such location should not be changed; 'and this shall apply as well to a railroad that may have been consolidated with another as to those which have maintained their original organization.' A violation of the Act entails forfeiture of the charter, with a penalty of $5,000 a day for every day of violation. Rev. St. art. 6425. An Act approved two days later, March 29, 1889 (Acts 21st Leg. c. 24), with provisos that no rights should be acquired inconsistent with the present Constitution, that the main track once constructed and operated should not be removed, etc., authorized purchasers of soldout railroads to form a new corporation, whereas previously the purchaser had continued the franchises of the old under the original grant. A law of September 1, 1910, (Acts 4th Called Sess. c. 4), further emphasized the change of policy by excluding a succession to the old charter unless coupled with an acceptance of certain liabilities, and providing that the charter should pass subject to the provisions and limitations imposed and to be imposed by law. Rev. St. art. 6625. \n\n[246 U.S. 424, 431]\n\u00a0\n The mortgage of 1881 last mentioned was foreclosed by proceedings in the Circuit Court of the United States. A decree of May 10, 1910, while reserving jurisdiction of the property, ordered a sale, which, after postponements, took place on June 13, 1911, and was confirmed the next day. On September 25, 1911, the railroad and franchises were finally discharged from the possession and control of the receiver and the Court. Before that date the plaintiff in error was incorporated under the Act of 1889 and general laws and took the conveyances under the foreclosure decree. Within the time allowed it had filed in Court a repudiation of any agreement on the part of any of its predecessors to maintain their offices and shops at Palestine, and later gave notice to that effect to officials of Anderson County and Palestine. The articles of incorporation fixed the place for the general offices as Houston.\n The railway company denies the jurisdiction of the State Court and sets up that the court of the last foreclosure is the only proper forum. But a decree of foreclosure does not render the purchaser and property foreclosed sacrosanct. The Circuit Court had finished the case and had given up possession and control before this suit was brought. Shields v. Coleman, \n157 \nU.S. 168, 178\n, 179 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 570; Wabash R. R. Co. v. Adelbert College, \n208 \nU.S. 38, 55\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 182. Even if it were true that the foreclosure sale and order carried an immunity from the present demand that the railway was entitled to set up, in the absence of action on the part of the Court of the United States, it would not take away the power of the State Court to decide as to the existence of an alleged public duty on the part of a railroad within the territory where th court sat. Ricaud v. American Metal Co. (March 11, 1918) \n246 U.S. 304\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 312, 62 L. Ed. --.\n But the foreclosures did not have the supposed effect. They no more removed all human restrictions than they excluded the authority of ordinary courts. Suppose \n\n[246 U.S. 424, 432]\n\u00a0\n that a special act incorporating the mortgagor had provided in terms evidently intended to reach beyond foreclosure that the general offices were to remain forever at Palestine, it hardly would be argued, and certainly would not be argued here or in Texas with success, that the requirement could be touched by a decree. But if the law made that requirement, it hardly matters whether the restriction was imposed by charter or otherwise or whether the remote reason for it was a contract or a general notion of public policy. The State Courts hold that when the law on any ground fixes the place of the offices and shops the obligation is indelible by foreclosure. We see no reason why their decision should not prevail.\n It is contended that the Office-Shops Act of 1889 does not touch the plaintiff in error by its term and that if it be construed to do so it is unconstitutional. On the construction of the Act it seems to us that there can be no doubt. It is true that the provision requiring the general offices to be maintained at the place where the railroad had contracted to keep them is conditioned on no place being named in the charter, but of course this does not mean that articles framed under a general law can get rid of contracts that otherwise would bind, and in our opinion it is equally plain that no distinction was intended between the contract by the present road and one by its predecessor, if the office and shops 'are located on the line of a railroad in a county which has aided said railroad by an issue of bonds in consideration of such location being made.' 'Then,' the statute says, 'said location shall not be changed.' The construction of the Act by the State Court is beyond criticism upon this point.\n It is said that the Act so construed would infringe the constitutional rights of the parties to the mortgage of 1881, which the plaintiff in error took by foreclosure. \n\n[246 U.S. 424, 433]\n\u00a0\n But it will be remembered that the mortgagor under the law then in force merely had succeeded to the original contractors, freed from their unsecured debts, no doubt, but, it well might be held, not freed from the obligation in question. Also it was found by the Courts below that the sale under which the mortgagor took in 1879 was not a bona fide sale, and so was not a sale that put the purchaser in a position other than that of mortgagor. Apart from these considerations we should be slow to say that it was not within the power of a state legislature dealing with a corporation of the state to fix the place of its domicile and principal offices, in the absence of other facts than those appearing in this case. But furthermore when the Office-Shops Act was on the statute book the plaintiff in error took out a charter under general laws that expressly subjected it to the limitations imposed by law. It is said that this does not make the plaintiff in error adopt an otherwise unconstitutional statute. But even if, contrary to what we have intimated, the Act could not otherwise have affected those particular corporations, it was a law upon the statute books and was far from a mere nullity, and if it was made a condition of incorporation that this restriction should be accepted, the plaintiff in error cannot complain. Interstate Consolidated Street Ry. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n207 U.S. 79\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 26, 12 Ann. Cas. 555. We agree with the State Courts that the condition was imposed.\n The acceptance of the charter by the plaintiff in error disposed of every constitutional objection but one. It is said that the restriction imposes a burden upon commerce among the States, since the road concerned has expanded and now is largely engaged in such commerce. The jury found that it imposed no such burden, upon an issue submitted to th m in accordance with the desire of the plaintiff in error, although not in the form that it desired. So far as the question depended upon \n\n[246 U.S. 424, 434]\n\u00a0\n the testimony adduced the verdict must be accepted, and although no doubt there might be cases in which this Court would pronounce for itself, irrespective of testimony, whether a burden was imposed, we are not prepared to say that in this instance the State has transcended its powers. The burden if any is indirect. Some complaint is made of the form of the judgment, as purporting to be perpetual. But the word perpetual adds nothing to a requirement that the office and shops should be maintained in Palestine. The requirement is perpetual until the law is changed. When and how it may be changed is not before us now. Other objections are urged and other details are adverted to in the very lengthy printed arguments, besides those with which we have dealt, but we deem it unnecessary to go farther. Upon the whole case we are of opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","73":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERNATIONAL NEWS SERVICE v. ASSOCIATED PRESS(1918)\nNo. 221\nArgued: Decided: December 23, 1918\n\n\n Press \n248 U.S. 215\n (1918) ]\n\n\n[248 U.S. 215, 217]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel Untermyer, of New York City, Hiram W. Johnson, of San Francisco, Cal., and Henry A. Wise and William A De Ford, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 215, 221]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frederic W. Lehmann, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The parties are competitors in the gathering and distribution of news and its publication for profit in newspapers throughout the United States. The Associated Press, which was complainant in the District Court, is a co- operative organization, incorporated under the Membership Corporations Law of the state of New York, its members being individuals who are either proprietors or representatives of about 950 daily newspapers published in all parts of the United States. That a corporation may be organized under that act for the purpose of gathering news for the use and benefit of its members and for publication in newspapers owned or represented by them, is recognized by an amendment enacted in 1901 (Laws N. Y. 1901, c. 436). Complainant gathers in all parts of the world, by means of various instrumentalities of its own, by exchange with its members, and by other appropriate means, news and intelligence of current and recent events of interest to newspaper readers and distributes it daily to its members for publication in their newspapers. The cost of the service, amounting approximately to $3,500,000 per annum, is assessed upon the members and becomes a part of their costs of operation, to be recouped, presumably with profit, through\n\n\n[248 U.S. 215, 230]\n\u00a0\n the publication of their several newspapers. Under complainant's by-laws each member agrees upon assuming membership that news received through complainant's service is received exclusively for publication in a particular newspaper, language, and place specified in the certificate of membership, that no other use of it shall be permitted, and that no member shall furnish or permit any one in his employ or connected with his newspaper to furnish any of complainant's news in advance of publication to any person not a member. And each member is required to gather the local news of his district and supply it to the Associated Press and to no one else.\n Defendant is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of New Jersey, whose business is the gathering and selling of news to its customers and clients, consisting of newspapers published throughout the United States, under contracts by which they pay certain amounts at stated times for defendant's service. It has widespread news-gathering agencies; the cost of its operations amounts, it is said, to more than $2,000,000 per annum; and it serves about 400 newspapers located in the various cities of the United States and abroad, a few of which are represented, also, in the membership of the Associated Press.\n The parties are in the keenest competition between themselves in the distribution of news throughout the United States; and so, as a rule, are the newspapers that they serve, in their several districts.\n Complainant in its bill, defendant in its answer, have set forth in almost identical terms the rather obvious circumstances and conditions under which their business is conducted. The value of the service, and of the news furnished, depends upon the promptness of transmission, as well as upon the accuracy and impartiality of the news; it being essential that the news be transmitted to members or subscribers as early or earlier than similar information can be furnished to competing newspapers \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 231]\n\u00a0\n by other news services, and that the news furnished by each agency shall not be furnished to newspapers which do not contribute to the expense of gathering it. And further, to quote from the answer:\n'Prompt knowledge and publication of worldwide news is essential to the conduct of a modern newspaper, and by reason of the enormous expense incident to the gathering and distribution of such news, the only practical way in which a proprietor of a newspaper can obtain the same is, either through co-operation with a considerable number of other newspaper proprietors in the work of collecting and distributing such news, and the equitable division with them of the expenses thereof, or by the purchase of such news from some existing agency engaged in that business.'\n\n The bill was filed to restrain the pirating of complainant's news by defendant in three ways: First, by bribing employes of newspapers published by complainant's members to furnish Associated Press news to defendant before publication, for transmission by telegraph and telephone to defendant's clients for publication by them; second, by inducing Associated Press members to violate its by-laws and permit defendant to obtain news before publication; and, third, by copying news from bulletin boards and from early editions of complainant's newspapers and selling this, either bodily or after rewriting it, to defendant's customers.\n The District Court, upon consideration of the bill and answer, with voluminous affidavits on both sides, granted a preliminary injunction under the first and second heads, but refused at that stage to restrain the systematic practice admittedly pursued by defendant, of taking news bodily from the bulletin boards and early editions of complainant's newspapers and selling it as its own. The court expressed itself as satisfied that this practice amounted to unfair trade, but as the legal question was \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 232]\n\u00a0\n one of first impression it considered that the allowance of an injunction should await the outcome of an appeal. 240 Fed. 983, 996. Both parties having appealed, the Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the injunction order so far as it went, and upon complainant's appeal modified it and remanded the cause, with directions to issue an injunction also against any bodily taking of the words or substance of complainant's news until its commercial value as news had passed away. 245 Fed. 244, 253, 157 C. C. A. 436. The present writ of certiorari was then allowed. \n245 U.S. 644\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 10.\n The only matter that has been argued before us is whether defendant may lawfully be restrained from appropriating news taken from bulletins issued by complainant or any of its members, or from newspapers published by them, for the purpose of selling it to defendant's clients. Complainant asserts that defendant's admitted course of conduct in this regard both violates complainant's property right in the news and constitutes unfair competition in business. And notwithstanding the case has proceeded only to the stage of a preliminary injunction, we have deemed it proper to consider the underlying questions, since they go to the very merits of the action and are presented upon facts that are not in dispute. As presented in argument, these questions are: (1) Whether there is any property in news; (2) Whether, if there be property in news collected for the purpose of being published, it survives the instant of its publication in the first newspaper to which it is communicated by the news-gatherer; and (3) whether defendant's admitted course of conduct in appropriating for commercial use matter taken from bulletins or early editions of Associated Press publications constitutes unfair competition in trade.\n The federal jurisdiction was invoked because of diversity of citizenship, not upon the ground that the suit arose under the copyright or other laws of the United \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 233]\n\u00a0\n States. Complainant's news matter is not copyrighted. It is said that it could not, in practice, be copyrighted, because of the large number of dispatches that are sent daily; and, according to complainant's contention, news is not within the operation of the copyright act. Defendant, while apparently conceding this, nevertheless invokes the analogies of the law of literary property and copyright, insisting as its principal contention that, assuming complainant has a right of property in its news, it can be maintained (unless the copyright act by complied with) only by being kept secret and confidential, and that upon the publication with complainant's consent of uncopyrighted news of any of complainant's members in a newspaper or upon a bulletin board, the right of property is lost, and the subsequent use of the news by the public or by defendant for any purpose whatever becomes lawful.\n A preliminary objection to the form in which the suit is brought may be disposed of at the outset. It is said that the Circuit Court of Appeals granted relief upon considerations applicable to particular members of the Associated Press, and that this was erroneous because the suit was brought by complainant as a corporate entity, and not by its members; the argument being that their interests cannot be protected in this proceeding any more than the individual rights of a stockholder can be enforced in an action brought by the corporation. From the averments of the bill, however, it is plain that the suit in substance was brought for the benefit of complainant's members, and that they would be proper parties, and, except for their numbers, perhaps necessary parties. Complainant is a proper party to conduct the suit as representing their interest; and since no specific objection, based upon the want of parties, appears to have been made below, we will treat the objection as waived. See Equity Rules 38, 43, 44 (33 Sup. Ct. xxix, xxx). \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 234]\n\u00a0\n In considering the general question of property in news matter, it is necessary to recognize its dual character, distinguishing between the substance of the information and the particular form or collocation of words in which the writer has communicated it.\n No doubt news articles often possess a literary quality, and are the subject of literary property at the common law; nor do we question that such an article, as a literary production, is the subject of copyright by the terms of the act as it now stands. In an early case at the circuit Mr. Justice Thompson held in effect that a newspaper was not within the protection of the copyright acts of 1790 (1 Stat. 124) and 1802 (2 Stat. 171). Clayton v. Stone, 2 Paine, 382, Fed. Cas. No. 2,872. But the present act is broader; it provides that the works for which copyright may be secured shall include 'all the writings of an author,' and specifically mentions 'periodicals, including newspapers.' Act of March 4, 1909, c. 320 ,  4 and 5, 35 Stat. 1075, 1076 (Comp. St. 1916,  9520, 9521). Evidently this admits to copyright a contribution to a newspaper, notwithstanding it also may convey news; and such is the practice of the copyright office, as the newspapers of the day bear witness. See Copyright Office Bulletin No. 15 (1917) pp. 7, 14, 16, 17.\n But the news element-the information respecting current events contained in the literary production-is not the creation of the writer, but is a report of matters that ordinarily are publici juris; it is the history of the day. It is not to be supposed that the framers of the Constitution, when they empowered Congress 'to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries' (Const. art. 1,  8, par. 8), intended to confer upon one who might happen to be the first to report a historic event the exclusive right for any period to spread the knowledge of it.\n We need spend no time, however, upon the general \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 235]\n\u00a0\n question of property in news matter at common law, or the application of the copyright act, since it seems to us the case must turn upon the question of unfair competition in business. And, in our opinion, this does not depend upon any general right of property analogous to the common-law right of the proprietor of an unpublished work to prevent its publication without his consent; nor is it foreclosed by showing that the benefits of the copyright act have been waived. We are dealing here not with restrictions upon publication but with the very facilities and processes of publication. The peculiar value of news is in the spreading of it while it is fresh; and it is evident that a valuable property interest in the news, as news, cannot be maintained by keeping it secret. Besides, except for matters improperly disclosed, or published in breach of trust or confidence, or in violation of law, none of which is involved in this brance of the case, the news of current events may be regarded as common property. What we are concerned with is the business of making it known to the world, in which both parties to the present suit are engaged. That business consists in maintaining a prompt, sure, steady, and reliable service designed to place the daily events of the world at the breakfast table of the millions at a price that, while of trifling moment to each reader, is sufficient in the aggregate to afford compensation for the cost of gathering and distributing it, with the added profit so necessary as an incentive to effective action in the commercial world. The service thus performed for newspaper readers is not only innocent but extremely useful in itself, and indubitably constitutes a legitimate business. The parties are competitors in this field; and, on fundamental principles, applicable here as elsewhere, when the rights or privileges of the one are liable to conflict with those of the other, each party is under a duty so to conduct its own business as not unnecessarily or unfairly to injure \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 236]\n\u00a0\n that of the other. Hitchman Coal & Coke Co. v. Mitchell, \n245 \nU.S. 229, 254\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 65, L. R. A. 1918C, 497, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 461.\n Obviously, the question of what is unfair competition in business must be determined with particular reference to the character and circumstances of the business. The question here is not so much the rights of either party as against the public but their rights as between themselves. See Morison v. Moat, 9 Hare, 241, 258. And, although we may and do assume that neither party has any remaining property interest as against the public in uncopyrighted news matter after the moment of its first publication, it by no means follows that there is no remaining property interest in it as between themselves. For, to both of them alike, news matter, however little susceptible of ownership or dominion in the absolute sense, is stock in trade, to be gathered at the cost of enterprise, organization, skill, labor, and money, and to be distributed and sold to those who will pay money for it, as for any other merchandise. Regarding the news, therefore, as but the material out of which both parties are seeking to make profits at the same time and in the same field, we hardly can fail to recognize that for this purpose, and as between them, it must be regarded as quasi property, irrespective of the rights of either as against the public.\n In order to sustain the jurisdiction of equity over the controversy, we need not affirm any general and absolute property in the news as such. The rule that a court of equity concerns itself only in the protection of property rights treats any civil right of a pecuniary nature as a property right (In re Sawyer, \n124 \nU.S. 200, 210\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 482; In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564, 593\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 900); and the right to acquire property by honest labor or the conduct of a lawful business is as much entitled to protection as the right to guard property already acquired (Truax v. Raich, \n239 U.S. 33\n, 37-38, 36 Sup. Ct. 7, L. R. A. 1916D, 545, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 283; Brennan v. United Hatters, 73 N. J. Law, 729, 742, 65 Atl. 165, 9 L. R. A. [N. S.] 254, 118 Am. St. Rep. 727, 9 Ann. Cas. 698; \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 237]\n\u00a0\n Barr v. Essex Trades Council, 53 N. J. Eq. 101, 30 Atl. 881). It is this right that furnishes the basis of the jurisdiction in the ordinary case of unfair competition.\n The question, whether one who has gathered general information or news at pains and expense for the purpose of subsequent publication through the press has such an interest in its publication as may be protected from interference, has been raised many times, although never, perhaps, in the precise form in which it is now presented.\n Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., \n198 \nU.S. 236, 250\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 637, related to the distribution of quotations of prices on dealings upon a board of trade, which were collected by plaintiff and communicated on confidential terms to numerous persons under a contract not to make them public. This court held that, apart from certain special objections that were overruled, plaintiff's collection of quotations was entitled to the protection of the law; that, like a trade secret, plaintiff might keep to itself the work done at its expense, and did not lose its right by communicating the result to persons, even if many, in confidential relations to itself, under a contract not to make it public; and that strangers should be restrained from getting at the knowledge by inducing a breach of trust.\n In National Tel. News Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 119 Fed. 294, 56 C. C. A. 198, 60 L. R. A. 805, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit dealt with news matter gathered and transmitted by a telegraph company, and consisting merely of a notation of current events having but a transient value due to quick transmission and distribution; and, while declaring that this was not copyrightable although printed on a tape by tickers in the offices of the recipients, and that it was a commercial not a literary product, nevertheless held that the business of gathering and communicating the news-the service of purveying it-was a legitimate business, meeting a distinctive commercial want and adding to the facilities of the business \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 238]\n\u00a0\n world, and partaking of the nature of property in a sense that entitled it to the protection of a court of equity against piracy.\n Other cases are cited, but none that we deem it necessary to mention.\n Not only do the acquisition and transmission of news require elaborate organization and a large expenditure of money, skill, and effort; not only has it an exchange value to the gatherer, dependent chiefly upon its novelty and freshness, the regularity of the service, its reputed reliability and thoroughness, and its adaptability to the public needs; but also, as is evident, the news has an exchange value to one who can misappropriate it.\n The peculiar features of the case arise from the fact that, while novelty and freshness form so important an element in the success of the business, the very processes of distribution and publication necessarily occupy a good deal of time. Complainant's service, as well as defendant's, is a daily service to daily newspapers; most of the foreign news reaches this country at the Atlantic seaboard, principally at the city of New York, and because of this, and of time differentials due to the earth's rotation, the distribution of news matter throughout the country is principally from east to west; and, since in speed the telegraph and telephone easily outstrip the rotation of the earth, it is a simple matter for defendant to take complainant's news from bulletins or early editions of complainant's members in the eastern cities and at the mere cost of telegraphic transmission cause it to be published in western papers issued at least as warly as those served by complainant. Besides this, and irrespective of time differentials, irregularities in telegraphic transmission on different lines, and the normal consumption of time in printing and distributing the newspaper, result in permitting pirated news to be placed in the hands of defendant's readers sometimes simultaneously with the service \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 239]\n\u00a0\n of competing Associated Press papers, occasionally even earlier.\n Defendant insists that when, with the sanction and approval of complainant, and as the result of the use of its news for the very purpose for which it is distributed, a portion of complainant's members communicate it to the general public by posting it upon bulletin boards so that all may read, or by issuing it to newspapers and distributing it indiscriminately, complainant no longer has the right to control the use to be made of it; that when it thus reaches the light of day it becomes the common possession of all to whom it is accessible; and that any purchaser of a newspaper has the right to communicate the intelligence which it contains to anybody and for any purpose, even for the purpose of selling it for profit to newspapers published for profit in competition with complainant's members.\n The fault in the reasoning lies in applying as a test the right of the complainant as against the public, instead of considering the rights of complainant and defendant, competitors in business, as between themselves. The right of the purchaser of a single newspaper to spread knowledge of its contents gratuitously, for any legitimate purpose not unreasonably interfering with complainant's right to make merchandise of it, may be admitted; but to transmit that news for commercial use, in competition with complainant-which is what defendant has done and seeks to justify-is a very different matter. In doing this defendant, by its very act, admits that it is taking material that has been acquired by complainant as the result of organization and the expenditure of labor, skill, and money, and which is salable by complainant for money, and that defendant in appropriating it and selling it as its own is endeavoring to reap where it has not sown, and by disposing of it to newspapers that are competitors of complainant's members is appropriating to itself the harvest \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 240]\n\u00a0\n of those who have sown. Stripped of all disguises, the process amounts to an unauthorized interference with the normal operation of complainant's legitimate business precisely at the point where the profit is to be reaped, in order to divert a material portion of the profit from those who have earned it to those who have not; with special advantage to defendant in the competition because of the fact that it is not burdened with any part of the expense of gathering the news. The transaction speaks for itself and a court of equity ought not to hesitate long in characterizing it as unfair competition in business.\n The underlying principle is much the same as that which lies at the base of the equitable theory of consideration in the law of trusts-that he who has fairly paid the price should have the beneficial use of the property. Pom. Eq. Jur.  981. It is no answer to say that complainant spends its money for that which is too fugitive or evanescent to be the subject of property. That might, and for the purposes of the discussion we are assuming that it would furnish an answer in a common-law controversy. But in a court of equity, where the question is one of unfair competition, if that which complainant has acquired fairly at substantial cost may be sold fairly at substantial profit, a competitor who is misappropriating it for the purpose of disposing of it to his own profit and to the disadvantage of complainant cannot be heard to say that it is too fugitive or evanescent to be regarded as property. It has all the attributes of property necessary for determining that a misappropriation of it by a competitor is unfair competition because contrary to good conscience.\n The contention that the news is abandoned to the public for all purposes when published in the first newspaper is untenable. Abandonment is a question of intent, and the entire organization of the Associated Press negatives such a purpose. The cost of the service would be prohibited if the reward were to be so limited. No single \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 241]\n\u00a0\n newspaper, no small group of newspapers, could sustain the expenditure. Indeed, it is one of the most obvious results of defendant's theory that, by permitting indiscriminate publication by anybody and everybody for purposes of profit in competition with the news-gatherer, it would render publication profitless, or so little profitable as in effect to cut off the service by rendering the cost prohibitive in comparison with the return. The practical needs and requirements of the business are reflected in complainant's by-laws which have been referred to. Their effect is that publication by each member must be deemed not by any means an abandonment of the news to the world for any and all purposes, but a publication for limited purposes; for the benefit of the readers of the bulletin or the newspaper as such; not for the purpose of making merchandise of it as news, with the result of depriving complainant's other members of their reasonable opportunity to obtain just returns for their expenditures.\n It is to be observed that the view we adopt does not result in giving to complainant the right to monopolize either the gathering or the distribution of the news, or, without complying with the copyright act, to prevent the reproduction of its news articles, but only postpones participation by complainant's competitor in the processes of distribution and reproduction of news that it has not gathered, and only to the extent necessary to prevent that competitor from reaping the fruits of complainant's efforts and expenditure, to the partial exclusion of complainant. and in violation of the principle that underlies the maxim 'sic utere tuo,' etc.\n It is said that the elements of unfair competition are lacking because there is no attempt by defendant to palm off its goods as those of the complainant, characteristic of the most familiar, if not the most typical, cases of unfair competition. Howe Scale Co. v. Wyckoff, Seamans, etc., \n198 \nU.S. 118, 140\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 609. But we cannot concede that \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 242]\n\u00a0\n the right to equitable relief is confined to that class of cases. In the present case the fraud upon complainant's rights is more direct and obvious. Regarding news matter as the mere material from which these two competing parties are endeavoring to make money, and treating it, therefore, as quasi property for the purposes of their business because they are both selling it as such, defendant's conduct differs from the ordinary case of unfair competition in trade principally in this that, instead of selling its own goods as those of complainant, it substitutes misappropriation in the place of misrepresentation, and sells complainant's goods as its own.\n Besides the misappropriation, there are elements of imitation, of false pretense, in defendant's practices. The device of rewriting complainant's news articles, frequently resorted to, carries its own comment. The habitual failure to give credit to complainant for that which is taken is significant. Indeed, the entire system of appropriating complainant's news and transmitting it as a commercial product to defendant's clients and patrons amounts to a false representation to them and to their newspaper readers that the news transmitted is the result of defendant's own investigation in the field. But these elements, although accentuating the wrong, are not the essence of it. It is something more than the advantage of celebrity of which complainant is being deprived.\n The doctrine of unclean hands is invoked as a bar to relief; it being insisted that defendant's practices against which complainant seeks an injunction are not different from the practice attributed to complainant, of utilizing defendant's news published by its subscribers. At this point it becomes necessary to consider a distinction that is drawn by complainant, and, as we understand it, was recognized by defendant also in the submission of proofs in the District Court, between two kinds of use that may be made by one news agency of news taken from the \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 243]\n\u00a0\n bulletins and newspapers of the other. The first is the bodily appropriation of a statement of fact or a news article, with or without rewriting, but without independent investigation or other expense. This form of pirating was found by both courts to have been pursued by defendant systematically with respect to complainant's news, and against it the Circuit Court of Appeals granted an injunction. This practice complainant denies having pursued and the denial was sustained by the finding of the District Court. It is not contended by defendant that the finding can be set aside, upon the proofs as they now stand. The other use is to take the news of a rival agency as a 'tip' to be investigated, and if verified by independent investigation the news thus gathered is sold. This practice complainant admits that it has pursued and still is willing that defendant shall employ.\n Both courts held that complainant could not be debarred on the ground of unclean hands upon the score of pirating defendant's news, because not shown to be guilty of sanctioning this practice.\n As to securing 'tips' from a competing news agency the District Court ( 240 Fed. 991, 995), while not sanctioning the practice, found that both parties had adopted it in accordance with common business usage, in the belief that their conduct was technically lawful, and hence did not find in it any sufficient ground for attributing unclean hands to complainant. The Circuit Court of Appeals (245 Fed. 247, 157 C. C. A. 436) found that the tip habit, though discouraged by complainant, was 'incurably journalistic,' and that there was 'no difficulty in discriminating between the utilization of tips and the bodily appropriation of another's labor in accumulating and stating information.'\n We are inclined to think a distinction may be drawn between the utilization of tips and the bodily appropriation of news matter, either in its original form or after \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 244]\n\u00a0\n rewriting and without independent investigation and verification; whatever may appear at the final hearing, the proofs as they now stand recognize such a distinction; both parties avowedly recognize the practice of taking tips, and neither party alleges it to be unlawful or to amount to unfair competition in business. In a line of English cases a somewhat analogous practice has been held not to amount to an infringement of the copyright of a directory or other book containing compiled information. In Kelly v. Morris, L. R. 1 Eq. 697, 701, 702, Vice Chancellor Sir William Page Wood ( afterwards Lord Hatherly), dealing with such a case, said that defendant was\n'not entitled to take one word of the information previously published without independently working out the matter for himself, so as to arrive at the same result from the same common sources of information, and the only use that he can legitimately make of a previous publication is to verify his own calculations and results when obtained.'\n\n This was followed by Vice Chancellor Giffard in Morris v. Ashbee, L. R. 7 Eq. 34, where he said:\n'In a case such as this no one has a right to take the results of the labour and expense incurred by another for the purposes of a rival publication, and thereby save himself the expense and labour of working out and arriving at these results by some independent road.'\n\n A similar view was adopted by Lord Chancellor Hatherly and the former Vice Chancellor, then Giffard, L. J., in Pike v. Nicholas, L. R. 5 Ch. App. Cas. 251, and shortly afterwards by the latter judge in Morris v. Wright, L. R. 5 Ch. App. Cas. 279, 287, where he said, commenting upon Pike v. Nicholas:\n'It was a perfectly legitimate course for the defendant to refer to the plaintiff's book, and if, taking that book as his guide, he went to the original authorities and compiled his book from them, he made no unfair or improper use of the plaintiff's book; and so here, if the fact be that Mr. Wright used the plaintiff's \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 245]\n\u00a0\n book in order to guide himself to the persons on whom it would be worth his while to call, and for no other purpose, he made a perfectly legitimate use of the plaintiff's book.'\n\n A like distinction was recognized by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Edward Thompson Co. v. American Law Book Co., 122 Fed. 922, 59 C. C. A. 148, 62 L. R. A. 607 and in West Pub. Co. v. Edward Thompson Co., 176 Fed. 833, 838, 100 C. C. A. 303.\n In the case before us, in the present state of the pleadings and proofs, we need go no further than to hold, as we do, that the admitted pursuit by complainant of the practice of taking news items published by defendant's subscribers as tips to be investigated, and, if verified, the result of the investigation to be sold-the practice having been followed by defendant also, and by news agencies generally-is not shown to be such as to constitute an unconscientious or inequitable attitude towards its adversary so as to fix upon complainant the taint of unclean hands, and debar it on this ground from the relief to which it is otherwise entitled.\n There is some criticism of the injunction that was directed by the District Court upon the going down of the mandate from the Circuit Court of Appeals. In brief, it restrains any taking or gainfully using of the complainant's news, either bodily or in substance from bulletins issued by the complainant or any of its members, or from editions of their newspapers, 'until its commercial value as news to the complainant and all of its members has passed away.' The part complained of is the clause we have italicized; but if this be indefinite, it is no more so than the criticism. Perhaps it would be better that the terms of the injunction be made specific, and so framed as to confine the restraint to an extent consistent with the reasonable protection of complainant's newspapers, each in its own area and for a specified time after its \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 246]\n\u00a0\n publication, against the competitive use of pirated news by defendant's customers. But the case presents practical difficulities; and we have not the materials, either in the way of a definite suggestion of amendment, or in the way of proofs, upon which to frame a specific injunction; hence, while not expressing approval of the form adopted by the District Court, we decline to modify it at this preliminary stage of the case, and will leave that court to deal with the matter upon appropriate application made to it for the purpose.\n The decree of the Circuit court of Appeals will be\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n When an uncopyrighted combination of words is published there is no general right to forbid other people repeating them-in other words there is no property in the combination or in the thoughts or facts that the words express. Property, a creation of law, does not arise from value, although exchangeable-a matter of fact. Many exchangeable values may be destroyed intentionally without compensation. Property depends upon exclusion by law from interference, and a person is not excluded from using any combination of words merely because some one has used it before, even if it took labor and genius to make it. If a given person is to be prohibited from making the use of words that his neighbors are free to make some other ground must be found. One such ground is vaguely expressed in the phrase unfair trade. This means that the words are repeated by a competitor in business in such a way as to convey a misrepresentation that materially injures the person who first used them, by appropriating credit of some kind \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 247]\n\u00a0\n which the first user has earned. The ordinary case is a representation by device, appearance, or other indirection that the defendant's goods come from the plaintiff. But the only reason why it is actionable to make such a representation is that it tends to give the defendant an advantage in his competition with the plaintiff and that it is thought undesirable that an advantage should be gained in that way. Apart from that the defendant may use such unpatented devices and uncopyrighted combinations of words as he likes. The ordinary case, I say, is palming off the defendant's product as the plaintiff's but the same evil may follow from the opposite falsehood-from saying whether in words or by implication that the plaintiff's product is the defendant's, and that, it seems to me, is what has happened here.\n Fresh news is got only by enterprise and expense. To produce such news as it is produced by the defendant represents by implication that it has been acquired by the defendant's enterprise and at its expense. When it comes from one of the great news collecting agencies like the Associated Press, the source generally is indicated, plainly importing that credit; and that such a representation is implied may be inferred with some confidence from the unwillingness of the defendant to give the credit and tell the truth. If the plaintiff produces the news at the same time that the defendant does, the defendant's presentation impliedly denies to the plaintiff the credit of collecting the facts and assumes that credit to the defendant. If the plaintiff is later in Western cities it naturally will be supposed to have obtained its information from the defendant. The falsehood is a little more subtle, the injury, a little more indirect, than in ordinary cases of unfair trade, but I think that the principle that condemns the one condemns the other. It is a question of how strong an infusion of fraud is necessary to turn a flavor into a poison. The does seems to me strong \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 248]\n\u00a0\n enough here to need a remedy from the law. But as, in my view, the only ground of complaint that can be recognized without legislation is the implied misstatement, it can be corrected by stating the truth; and a suitable acknowledgment of the source is all that the plaintiff can require. I think that within the limits recognized by the decision of the Court the defendant should be enjoined from publishing news obtained from the Associated Press for hours after publication by the plaintiff unless it gives express credit to the Associated Press; the number of hours and the form of acknowledgment to be settled by the District Court.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n There are published in the United States about 2,500 daily papers. \n1\n More than 800 of them are supplied with domestic and foreign news of general interest by the Associated Press-a corporation without capital stock which does not sell news or earn or seek to earn profits, but serves merely as an instrumentality by means of which these papers supply themselves at joint expense with such news. Papers not members of the Associated Press depend for their news of general interest largely upon agencies organized for profit. \n2\n Among these agen \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 249]\n\u00a0\n cies is the International News Service which supplies news to about 400 subscribing papers. It has, like the Associated Press, bureaus and correspondents in this and foreign countries; and its annual expenditures in gathering and distributing news is about $2,000,000. Ever since its organization in 1909, it has included among the sources from which it gathers news, copies (purchased in the open market of early editions of some papers published by members of the Associated Press and the bulletins publicly posted by them. These items, which constitute but a small part of the news transmitted to its subscribers, are generally verified by the International News Service before transmission; but frequently items are transmitted without verification; and occasionally even without being re- written. In no case is the fact disclosed that such item was suggested by or taken from a paper or bulletin published by an Associated Press member.\n No question of statutory copyright is involved. The sole question for our consideration is this: Was the International News Service properly enjoined from using, or causing to be used gainfully, news of which it acquired knowledge by lawful means (namely, by reading publicly posted bulletins or papers purchased by it in the open market) merely because the news had been originally gathered by the Associated Press and continued to be of value to some of its members, or because it did not reveal the source from which it was acquired?\n The 'ticker' cases, the cases concerning literary and artistic compositions, and cases of unfair competition were relied upon in support of the injunction. But it is admitted that none of those cases affords a complete analogy with that before us. The question presented for decision is new, and it is important.\n News is a report of recent occurrences. The business of the news agency is to gather systematically knowledge \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 250]\n\u00a0\n of such occurrences of interest and to distribute reports thereof. The Associated Press contended that knowledge so acquired is property, because it costs money and labor to produce and because it has value for which those who have it not are ready to pay; that it remains property and is entitled to protection as long as it has commercial value as news; and that to protect it effectively, the defendant must be enjoined from making, or causing to be made, any gainful use of it while it retains such value. An essential element of individual property is the legal right to exclude others from enjoying it. If the property is private, the right of exclusion may be absolute; if the property is affected with a public interest, the right of exclusion is qualified. But the fact that a product of the mind has cost its producer money and labor, and has a value for which others are willing to pay, is not sufficient to ensure to it this legal attribute of property. The general rule of law is, that the noblest of human productions-knowledge, truths ascertained, conceptions, and ideas- became, after voluntary communication to others, free as the air to common use. Upon these incorporeal productions the attribute of property is continued after such communication only in certain classes of cases where public policy has seemed to demand it. These exceptions are confined to productions which, in some degree, involve creation, invention, or discovery. But by no means all such are endowed with this attribute of property. The creations which are recognized as property by the common law are literary, dramatic, musical, and other artistic creations; and these have also protection under the copyright statutes. The inventions and discoveries upon which this attribute of property is conferred only by statute, are the few comprised within the patent law. There are also many other cases in which courts interfere to prevent curtailment of plaintiff's enjoyment of incorporal productions; and in which the \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 251]\n\u00a0\n right to relief is often called a property right, but is such only in a special sense. In those cases, the plaintiff has no absolute right to the protection of his production; he has merely the qualified right to be protected as against the defendant's acts, because of the special relation in which the latter stands or the wrongful method or means employed in acquiring the knowledge or the manner in which it is used. Protection of this character is afforded where the suit is based upon breach of contract or of trust or upon unfair competition.\n The knowledge for which protection is sought in the case at bar is not of a kind upon which the law has heretofore conferred the attributes of property; nor is the manner of its acquisition or use nor the purpose to which it is applied, such as has heretofore been recognized as entitling a plaintiff to relief.\n First. Plaintiff's principal reliance was upon the 'ticker' cases; but they do not support its contention. The leading cases on this subject rest the grant of relief, not upon the existence of a general property right in news, but upon the breach of a contract or trust concerning the use of news communicated; and that element is lacking here. In Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., \n198 \nU.S. 236, 250\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 637, 639 (49 L. Ed. 1031) the court said the Board--\n'does not lose its rights by communicating the result [the quotations] to persons, even if many, in confidential relations to itself, under a contract not to make it public, and strangers to the trust will be restained from getting at the knowledge by inducing a breach of trust and using knowledge obtained by such a breach.'\n\n And it is also stated there (\n198 U.S. 251\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 640):\n'Time is of the essence in matters like this, and it fairly may be said that, if the contracts with the plaintiff are kept, the information will not become public property until the plaintiff has gained its reward.'\n\n The only other case in this court which relates to this subject is Hunt v. N. Y. Cotton Exchange, 205 U. S. \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 252]\n\u00a0\n 322, 27 Sup. Ct. 529. While the opinion there refers the protection to a general property right in the quotations, the facts are substantially the same as those in the Christie Case, which is the chief authority on which the decision is based. Of the cases in the lower Federal courts and in the state courts it may be said, that most of them too can, on their facts, be reconciled with this principle, though much of the language of the courts cannot be. \n3\n In spite of anything that may appear in these cases to the contrary it seems that the true principle is stated in the Christie Case, that the collection of quotations 'stands like a trade secret.' And in Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., \n220 \nU.S. 373, 402\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 376, 382 (55 L. Ed. 502), this court says of trade secret:\n' any one may use it who fairly, by analysis and experiment, discovers it. But the complainant is entitled to be protected against invasion of its right in the process by fraud or by breach of trust or contract.'\n\n See John D. Park & Sons Co. v. Hartman, 153 Fed. 24, 29, 82 C. C. A. 158, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 135.\n The leading English case, Exchange Telegraph Co. v. Gregory & Co., [ 1896] 1 Q. B 147, is also rested clearly upon a breach of contract or trust, although there is some \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 253]\n\u00a0\n reference to a general property right. The later English cases seem to have rightly understood the basis of the decision, and they have not sought to extend it further than was intended. Indeed, we find the positive suggestion in some cases that the only ground for relief is the manner in which knowledge of the report of the news was acquired. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n If the news involved in the case at bar had been posted in violation of any agreement between the Associated Press and its members, questions similar to those in the 'ticker' cases might have arisen. But the plaintiff does not contend that the posting was wrongful or that any papers were wrongfully issued by its subscribers. On the contrary it is conceded that both the bulletins and the papers were issued in accordance with the regulations of the plaintiff. Under such circumstances, for a reader of the papers purchased in the open market, or a reader of the bulletins publicly posted, to procure and use gainfully, information therein contained, does not involve inducing any one to commit a breach either of contract or of trust, or committing or in any way abetting a breach of confidence.\n Second. Plaintiff also relied upon the cases which hold that the common law right of the producer to prohibit copying is not lost by the private circulation of a literary composition, the delivery of a lecture, the exhi \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 254]\n\u00a0\n bition of a painting, or the performance of a dramatic or musical composition. \n5\n These cases rest upon the ground that the common law recognizes such productions as property which, despite restricted communication, continues until there is a dedication to the public under the copyright statutes or otherwise. But they are inapplicable for two reasons: (1) At common law, as under the copyright acts, intellectual productions are entitled to such protection only if there is underneath something evincing the mind of a creator or originator, however modest the requirement. The mere record of isolated happenings, whether in words or by photographs not involving artistic skill, are denied such protection. \n6\n ( 2) At common law, as under the copyright acts, the element in intellectual productions which secures such protection, is not the knowledge, truths, ideas, or emotions which the composition expresses, but the form or sequence in which they are expressed; that is, 'some new collocation of visible or audible points-of lines, colors, sounds, or \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 255]\n\u00a0\n words.' See White-Smith Music Co. v. Apollo Co., \n209 \nU.S. 1, 19\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 319, 14 Ann. Cas. 628; Kalem Co. v. Harper Bros., \n222 \nU.S. 55, 63\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 20, Ann. Cas. 1913A, 1285. An author's theories, suggestions, and speculations, or the systems, plans, methods, and arrangements of an originator, derive no such protection from the statutory copyright of the book in which they are set forth;7 and they are likewise denied such protection at common law. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n That news is not property in the strict sense is illustrated by the case of Sports and General Press Agency, Ltd., v. 'Our Dogs' Publishing Co ., Ltd., \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 1916]\n\u00a0\n 2 K. B. 880, where the plaintiff, the assignee of the right to photograph the exhibits at a dog show, was refused an injunction against defendant who had also taken pictures of the show and was publishing them. The court said that, except in so far as the possession of the land occupied by the show enabled the proprietors to exclude people or permit them on condition that they agree not to take photographs (which condition was not imposed in that case), the proprietors had no exclusive right to photograph the show and could therefore grant no such right. And it was further stated that, at any rate, no matter what conditions might be imposed upon those entering the grounds, if the defendant had been on top of a house or in some position where he could photograph the show without interfering with the physical property of the plaintiff, the plaintiff would have no right to stop him. If, when the plaintiff creates the event recorded, he is not entitled to the exclusive first publication of the \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 256]\n\u00a0\n news (in that case a photograph) of the event, no reason can be shown why he should be accorded such protection as to events which he simply records and transmits to other parts of the world, though with great expenditure of time and money.\n Third. If news be treated as possessing the characteristics not of a trade secret, but of literary property, then the earliest issue of a paper of general circulation or the earliest public posting of a bulletin which embodies such news would, under the established rules governing literary property, operate as a publication, and all property in the news would then cease. Resisting this conclusion, plaintiff relied upon the cases which hold that uncopyrighted intellectual and artistic property survives private circulation or a restricted publication; and it contended that in each issue of each paper, a restriction is to be implied, that the news shall not be used gainfully in competition with the Associated Press or any of its members. There is no basis for such an implication. But it is, also, well settled that where the publication is in fact a general one- even express words of restriction upon use are inoperative. In other words, a general publication is effective to dedicate literary property to the public, regardless of the actual intent of its owner. \n9\n In the cases dealing with lectures, dramatic and musical performances, and art exhibitions,10 upon which plaintiff relied, there was no general publication in print comparable to the issue of daily newspapers or the unrestricted public posting of bulletins. The principles governing those cases differ more or less in application, if not in theory, from the principles governing the issue of printed copies; \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 257]\n\u00a0\n and in so far as they do differ, they have no application to the case at bar.\n Fourth. Plaintiff further contended that defendant's practice constitutes unfair competition, because there is 'appropriation without cost to itself of values created by' the plaintiff; and it is upon this ground that the decision of this court appears to be based. To appropriate and use for profit, knowledge and ideas produced by other men, without making compensation or even acknowledgment, may be inconsistent with a finer sense of propriety; but, with the exceptions indicated above, the law has heretofore sanctioned the practice. Thus it was held that one may ordinarily make and sell anything in any form, may copy with exactness that which another has produced, or may otherwise use his ideas without his consent and without the payment of compensation, and yet not inflict a legal injury;11 and that ordinarily one is at perfect liberty to find out, if he can by lawful means, trade secrets of another, however valuable, and then use the knowledge so acquired gainfully, although it cost the original owner much in effort and in money to collect or produce. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[248 U.S. 215, 258]\n\u00a0\n Such taking and gainful use of a product of another which, for reasons of public policy, the law has refused to endow with the attributes of property, does not become unlawful because the product happens to have been taken from a rival and is used in competition with him. The unfairness in competition which hitherto has been recognized by the law as a basis for relief, lay in the manner or means of conducting the business; and the manner or means held legally unfair, involves either fraud or force or the doing of acts otherwise prohibited by law. In the 'passing off' cases (the typical and most common case of unfair competition), the wrong consists in fraudulently representing by word or act that defendant's goods are those of plaintiff. See Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, \n240 \nU.S. 403, 412\n, 413 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 357. In the other cases, the diversion of trade was effected through physical or moral coercion, or by inducing breaches of contract or of trust or by enticing away employes. In some others, called cases of simulated competition, relief was granted because defendant's purpose was unlawful; namely, not competition but deliberate and wanton destruction of plaintiff's business. 13 \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 259]\n\u00a0\n That competition is not unfair in a legal sence, merely because the profits gained are unearned, even if made at the expense of a rival, is shown by many cases besides those referred to above. He who follows the pioneer into a new market, or who engages in the manufacture of an article newly introduced by another, seeks profits due largely to the labor and expense of the first adventurer; but the law sanctions, indeed encourages, the pursuit. \n14\n He who makes a city known through his product, must submit to sharing the resultant trade with others who, perhaps for that reason, locate there later. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311; Elgin National Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Co., \n179 \nU.S. 665, 673\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 270. He who has made his name a guaranty of quality, protests in vain when another with the same name engages, perhaps for that reason, in the same lines of business; provided, precaution is taken to prevent the public from being deceived into the belief that what he is selling, was made by his competitor. One bearing a name made famous by another is permitted to enjoy the unearned benefit which necessarily flows from such use, even though the use proves harmful to him who gave the name value. Brown Chemical Co. v. Meyer, \n139 \nU.S. 540, 544\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 625; Howe Scale Co. v. Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict, \n198 U.S. 118\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 609; Donnell v. Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Co., \n208 U.S. 267\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 288; Waterman Co. v. Modern Pen Co., \n235 U.S. 88\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 91. See Saxlehner v. Wagner, \n216 U.S. 375\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 298.\n The means by which the International News Service obtains news gathered by the Associated Press is also clearly unobjectionable. It is taken from papers bought in the open market or from bulletins publicly posted. \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 260]\n\u00a0\n No breach of contract such as the court considered to exist in Hitchman Coal & Coke Co. v. Mitchell, \n245 \nU.S. 229, 254\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 65, L. R. A. 1918C, 497 Ann. Cas. 1918B, 461; or of trust such as was present in Morison v. Moat, 9 Hare, 241; and neither fraud nor force is involved. The manner of use is likewise unobjectionable. No reference is made by word or by act to the Associated Press, either in transmitting the news to subscribers or by them in publishing it in their papers. Neither the International News Service nor its subscribers is gaining or seeking to gain in its business a benefit from the reputation of the Associated Press. They are merely using its product without making compensation. See Bamforth v. Douglass Post Card & Machine Co. (C. C.) 158 Fed. 355; Tribune Co. of Chicago v. Associated Press (C. C.) 116 Fed. 126. That they have a legal right to do, because the product is not property, and they do not stand in any relation to the Associated Press, either of contract or of trust, which otherwise precludes such use. The argument is not advanced by characterizing such taking and use a misappropriation.\n It is also suggested that the fact that defendant does not refer to the Associated Press as the source of the news may furnish a basis for the relief. But the defendant and its subscribers, unlike members of the Associated Press, were under no contractual obligation to disclose the source of the news; and there is no rule of law requiring acknowledgment to be made where uncopyrighted matter is reproduced. The International News Service is said to mislead its subscribers into believing that the news transmitted was originally gathered by it and that they in turn mislead their readers. There is, in fact, no representation by either of any kind. Sources of information are sometimes given because required by contract; sometimes because naming the source gives authority to an otherwise incredible statement; and sometimes the source is named because the agency does not wish to take the \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 261]\n\u00a0\n responsibility itself of giving currency to the news. But no representation can properly be implied from omission to mention the source of information except that the International News Service is transmitting news which it believes to be credible.\n Nor is the use made by the International News Service of the information taken from papers or bulletins of Associated Press members legally objectionable by reason of the purpose for which it was employed. The acts here complained of were not done for the purpose of injuring the business of the Associated Press. Their purpose was not even to divert its trade, or to put it at a disadvantage by lessening defendant's necessary expenses. The purpose was merely to supply subscribers of the International News Service promptly with all available news. The suit is, as this court declares, in substance one brought for the benefit of the members of the Associated Press, who would be proper, and except for their number perhaps necessary, parties; and the plaintiff conducts the suit as representing their interests. It thus appears that the protection given by the injunction is not actually to the business of the complainant news agency; for this agency does not sell news nor seek to earn profits, but is a mere instrumentality by which 800 or more newspapers collect and distribute news. It is these papers severally which are protected; and the protection afforded is not from competition of the defendant, but from possible competition of one or more of the 400 other papers which receive the defendant's service. Furthermore, the protection to these Associated Press members consists merely in denying to other papers the right to use as news, information which by authority of all concerned, had theretofore been given to the public by some of those who joined in gathering it; and to which the law denies the attributes of property. There is in defendant's purpose nothing on which to base a claim for relief. \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 262]\n\u00a0\n It is further said that, while that for which the Associated Press spends its money is too fugitive to be recognized as property in the common-law courts, the defendant cannot be heard to say so in a court of equity, where the question is one of unfair competition. The case presents no elements of equitable title or of breach of trust. The only possible reason for resort to a court of equity in a case like this is that the remedy which the law gives is inadequate. If the plaintiff has no legal cause of action, the suit necessarily fails. Levy v. Walker, L. R. 10 Ch. D. 436, 449. There is nothing in the situation of the parties which can estop the defendant from saying so.\n Fifth. The great development of agencies now furnishing country-wide distribution of news, the vastness of our territory, and improvements in the means of transmitting intelligence, have made it possible for a news agency or newspapers to obtain, without paying compensation, the fruit of another's efforts and to use news so obtained gainfully in competition with the original collector. The injustice of such action is obvious. But to give relief against it would involve more than the application of existing rules of law to new facts. It would require the making of a new rule in analogy to existing ones. The unwritten law possesses capacity for growth; and has often satisfied new demands for justice by invoking analogies or by expanding a rule or principle. This process has been in the main wisely applied and should not be discontinued. Where the problem is relatively simple, as it is apt to be when private interests only are involved, it generally proves adequate. But with the increasing complexity of society, the public interest tends to become omnipresent; and the problems presented by new demands for justice cease to be simple. Then the creation or recognition by courts of a new private right may work serious injury to the general public, unless the \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 263]\n\u00a0\n boundaries of the right are definitely established and wisely guarded. In order to reconcile the new private right with the public interest, it may be necessary to prescribe limitations and rules for its enjoyment; and also to provide administrative machinery for enforcing the rules. It is largely for this reason that, in the effort to meet the many new demands for justice incident to a rapidly changing civilization, resort to legislation has latterly been had with increasing frequency.\n The rule for which the plaintiff contends would effect an important extension of property rights and a corresponding curtailment of the free use of knowledge and of ideas; and the facts of this case admonish us of the danger involved in recognizing such a property right in news, without imposing upon news-gatherers corresponding obligations. A large majority of the newspapers and perhaps half the newspaper readers of the United States are dependent for their news of general interest upon agencies other than the Associated Press. The channel through which about 400 of these papers received, as the plaintiff alleges, 'a large amount of news relating to the European war of the greatest importance and of intense interest to the newspaper reading public' was suddenly closed. The closing to the International News Service of these channels for foreign news (if they were closed) was due not to unwillingness on its part to pay the cost of collecting the news, but to the prohibitions imposed by foreign governments upon its securing news from their respective countries and from using cable or telegraph lines running therefrom. For aught that appears, this prohibition may have been wholly undeserved; and at all events the 400 papers and their readers may be assumed to have been innocent. For aught that appears, the International News Service may have sought then to secure temporarily by arrangement with the Associated Press the latter's foreign news service. For aught that \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 264]\n\u00a0\n appears, all of the 400 subscribers of the International News Service would gladly have then become members of the Associated Press, if they could have secured election thereto.15 It is possible, also, that a large part of the readers of these papers were so situated that they could not secure prompt access to papers served by the Associated Press. The prohibition of the foreign governments might as well have been extended to the channels through which news was supplied to the more than a thousand other daily papers in the United States not served by the Associated Press; and a large part of their readers may also be so located that they cannot procure prompt access to papers served by the Associated Press.\n A Legislature, urged to enact a law by which one news agency or newspaper may prevent appropriation of the fruits of its labors by another, would consider such facts and possibilities and others which appropriate inquiry might disclose. Legislators might conclude that it was impossible to put an end to the obvious injustice involved in such appropriation of news, without opening the door to other evils, greater than that sought to be remedied. Such appears to have been the opinion of our Senate which reported unfavorably a bill to give news a few \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 265]\n\u00a0\n hours' protection;16 and which ratified, on February 15, 1911, the convention adopted at the Fourth International American Conference;17 and such was evidently the view also of the signatories to the International Copyright Union of November 13, 1908,18 as both these conventions expressly exclude news from copyright protection. \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 266]\n\u00a0\n Or legislators dealing with the subject might conclude, that the right to news values should be protected to the extent of permitting recovery of damages for any unauthorized use, but that protection by injunction should be denied, just as courts of equity ordinarily refuse ( perhaps in the interest of free speech) to restrain actionable libels,19 and for other reasons decline to protect by injunction mere political rights;20 and as Congress has prohibited courts from enjoining the illegal assessment or collection of federal taxes. \n21\n If a Legislature concluded to recognize property in published news to the extent of permitting recovery at law, it might, with a view to making the remedy more certain and adequate, provide a fixed measure of damages, as in the case of copyright infringement. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n Or again, a Legislature might conclude that it was unwise to recognize even so limited a property right in published news as that above indicated; but that a news agency should, on some conditions, be given full protection \n\n[248 U.S. 215, 267]\n\u00a0\n of its business; and to that end a remedy by injunction as well as one for damages should be granted, where news collected by it is gainfully used without permission. If a Legislature concluded (as at least one court has held, New York and Chicago Grain and Stock Exchange v. Board of Trade, 127 Ill. 153, 19 N. E. 855, 2 L. R. A. 411, 11 Am. St. Rep. 107) that under certain circumstances news-gathering is a business affected with a public interest; it might declare that, in such cases, news should be protected against appropriation, only if the gatherer assumed the obligation of supplying it at resonable rates and without discrimination, to all papers which applied therefor. If legislators reached that conclusion, they would probably go further, and prescribe the conditions under which and the extent to which the protection should be afforded; and they might also provide the administrative machinery necessary for insuring to the public, the press, and the news agencies, full enjoyment of the rights so conferred.\n Courts are ill-equipped to make the investigations which should precede a determination of the limitations which should be set upon any property right in news or of the circumstances under which news gathered by a private agency should be deemed affected with a public interest. Courts would be powerless to prescribe the detailed regulations essential to full enjoyment of the rights conferred or to introduce the machinery required for enforcement of such regulations. Considerations such as these should lead us to decline to establish a new rule of law in the effort to redress a newly disclosed wrong, although the propriety of some remedy appears to be clear. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See American Newspaper Annual and Directory (1918) pp. 4, 10, 1193- 1212. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Associated Press, by Frank B.

COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS(1918)\nNo. 733\nArgued: October 19, 1918Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 135, 136]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles A. Snow, of Boston, Mass., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Wm. Harold Hitchcock, of Boston, Mass., for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 135, 138]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by a New York corporation to recover the amount of an excise tax assessed against it in Massachusetts for the year 1915 and paid under protest, the right of recovery being predicated on the asserted invalidity of the tax under the commerce clause of the Constitution ( article 1,  8, cl.3) and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The tax is also assailed on other grounds which will be passed without particular notice. The case is set forth in an agreed statement, in the light of which \n\n[246 U.S. 135, 139]\n\u00a0\n the state court has sustained the tax. 228 Mass. 101, 117 N. E. 246. The Massachusetts statutes under which the tax was imposed are as follows:\n St. 1909, c. 490, pt. 3,  56: 'Every foreign corporation shall, in each year, at the time of filing its annual certificate of condition, pay to the treasurer and receiver general, for the use of the commonwealth, an excise tax to be assessed by the tax commissioner of one fiftieth of one per cent. of the par value of its authorized capital stock as stated in its annual certificate of condition; but the amount of such excise tax shall not in any one year exceed the sum of two thousand dollars.'\n St. 1914, c. 724,  1: 'Every foreign corporation subject to the tax imposed by section fifty-six of part III of chapter four hundred and ninety of the acts of the year nineteen hundred and nine shall in each year, at the time of filing its annual certificate of condition, pay to the treasurer and receiver general, for the use of the commonwealth, in addition to the tax imposed by said section fifty- six, an excise tax to be assessed by the tax commissioner of one one hundredth of one per cent. of the par value of its authorized capital stock in excess of ten million dollars as stated in its annual certificate of condition.'\n The facts shortly stated are these. The company, as before indicated, is a New York corporation. Its authorized capital stock, on which the tax was computed, is $45,000,000. Its total assets are not less than $39,000, 000 or $40,000,000, of which not more than 1 3\/4 per cent. are located or invested in Massachusetts. Its authorized and actual business is manufacturing and selling paper, in which connection it operates 23 paper mills 1 in Massachusetts and 22 in other states. The output of its mills is sold by it in both interstate and intrastate commerce, principally the former. In Massachusetts it maintains a selling office where two salesmen, with a bookkeeping and clerical force, negotiate sales of a part of the \n\n[246 U.S. 135, 140]\n\u00a0\n output to consumers in the New England states, subject to the approval of the home office in New York. About 86 per cent. of the sales negotiated through this selling office are in interstate commerce and the remainder are local to Massachusetts. The sales are made largely through long-term contracts with proprietors of newspapers whereby the company engages to supply their needs from its mills and from the output in transit at the time. No stock of goods is kept on hand in Massachusetts from which current sales are made. The executive and financial offices of the company are in New York, and none of its corporate or business activities are carried on in Massachusetts save as is here indicated. It pays local property taxes in Massachusetts on its real and personal property located there. In 1915 the assessed value of such property was $472,000 and the tax paid thereon was $8,118. The tax in question was in addition to the property tax and amounted to $5,500. It was imposed, so the state court holds, as an annual excise for the privilege of doing a local business within the state.\n While the legislation under which the tax was assessed and collected was enacted in part in 1909 and in part in 1914, its operation and validity must be determined here by considering it as a whole, for the opinion of the state court not only holds that the 'maximum limitation' put on the tax by the part first enacted 'is removed' by the other, but treats the two parts as exacting a single tax based on the par value of 'the entire authorized capital' and computed as to $10,000,000 thereof at the rate of one-fiftieth of 1 per cent. and as to the excess at the rate of one one-hundredth of 1 per cent.\n Cases involving the validity of state legislation of this character often have been before this court. The statutes considered have differed greatly, as have the circumstances in which they were applied, and the questions presented have varied accordingly. In disposing of these \n\n[246 U.S. 135, 141]\n\u00a0\n questions there has been at times some diversity of opinion among the members of the court and some of the decisions have not been in full accord with others. But the general principles which govern have come to be so well established as no longer to be open to controversy.\n The subject was extensively considered in Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 190. A statute of Kansas was there in question. As construed by the state court, it required a foreign corporation doing an interstate and local business in that and other states to pay a license fee or excise of a given per cent. of its authorized capital for the privilege of conducting a local business in that state. After reviewing the earlier decisions this court pronounced the statute invalid as being repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In that and two other cases (Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 56\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 232, and Ludwig v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n216 U.S. 146\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 280), which were before the court at the same time it was held:\n\n 1. \nThe power of a state to regulate the transaction of a local business within its borders by a foreign corporation-meaning a corporation of a sister state-is not unrestricted or absolute, but must be exerted in subordination to the limitations which the Constitution places on state action.\n\n 2. \nUnder the commerce clause exclusive power to regulate interstate commerce rests in Congress, and a state statute which either directly or by its necessary operation burdens such commerce is invalid, regardless of the purpose with which it was enacted.\n\n 3. \nConsistently with the d e process clause, a state cannot tax property belonging to a foreign corporation and neither located nor used within the confines of the state.\n\n 4. \nThat a foreign corporation is partly, or even chiefly, engaged in interstate commerce does not prevent a state in which it has property and is doing a local business from \n\n[246 U.S. 135, 142]\n\u00a0\n taxing that property and imposing a license fee or excise in respect of that business, but the state cannot require the corporation as a condition of the right to do a local business therein to submit to a tax on its interstate business or on its property outside the state.\n\n 5. \nA license fee or excise of a given per cent. of the entire authorized capital of a foreign corporation doing both a local and interstate business in several states, although declared by the state imposing it to be merely a charge for the privilege of conducting a local business therein, is essentially and for every practical purpose a tax on the entire business of the corporation, including that which is interstate, and on its entire property, including that in other states; and this because the capital stock of the corporation represents all its business of every class and all its property wherever located.\n\n 6. \nWhen tested, as it must be, by its substance-its essential and practical operation-rather than its form or local characterization, such a license fee or excise is unconstitutional and void as illegally burdening interstate commerce and also as wanting in due process because laying a tax on property beyond the jurisdiction of the state.\n True, those were cases where the business, interstate and local, in which the foreign corporation was engaged was that of a common carrier. But the immunity of interstate commerce from state taxation is not confined to what is done by the carriers in such commerce, On the contrary, it is universal and covers every class of interstate commerce, including that conducted by merchants and trading companies. And as respects the power of a state to tax property beyond its jurisdiction belonging to a foreign corporation, it is of no moment whether the corporation be a carrier or a trading company, for a state is wholly without power to impose such a tax.\n Our last decision on the subject was given during the \n\n[246 U.S. 135, 143]\n\u00a0\n present term in Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 U.S. 178\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 85, 62 L. Ed. --. The case was orally argued a second time at our request and was much considered. It involved the validity of a Texas statute which, as construed by the state court of last resort, required a foreign corporation as a condition to engaging in local business in that state to pay a permit tax based on its entire authorized capital and a franchise tax based on its outstanding capital plus its surplus and undivided profits. The foreign corporation complaining of these taxes was a manufacturing and trading company extensively engaged in interstate and local commerce, principally the former, in several states, including Texas. It maintained an agency in that state and had a large supply depot at one point therein and a warehouse at another. Of its gross sales and receipts for the year preceding the suit not more than 2 1\/2 per cent.-$1,019,750- had any relation to Texas and of this approximately one-half was interstate in character. The assessed value of its property in the state was $301,179, upon which it paid the usual ad valorem tax.\n Applying what was held in Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, supra, and the two other cases before cited, this court unanimously pronounced the Texas statute invalid as placing 'direct burdens on interstate commerce' and taxing 'property and rights which were wholly beyond the confines of the state and not subject to its jurisdiction.' Then turning to Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 U.S. 68\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 15, St. Louis, Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 U.S. 350\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 99, Kansas City, Ft. Scott & Memphis Ry. Co. v. Kansas, \n240 U.S. 227\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 261, and Kan as City, Memphis & Birmingham R. R. Co. v. Stiles, \n242 U.S. 111\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 58, which were relied on as practically overruling Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas and kindred cases, the court pointed out that the former contained express statements that they were not intended to limit the authority of the latter, and further said of the former (\n245 U.S. 189\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 87, 62 L. Ed. --): \n\n[246 U.S. 135, 144]\n\u00a0\n 'In the first place it is apparent in each of the cases that as the statutes under consideration were found not to be on their face inherently repugnant either to the commerce or due process clause of the Constitution, it came to be considered whether by their necessary operation and effect they were repugnant to the Constitution in the particulars stated, and this inquiry it was expressly pointed out was to be governed by the rule long ago announced in Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 U.S. 688\n, 698 [15 Sup. Ct. 268, 360] that 'the substance, and not the shadow, determines the validity of the exercise of the power.' In the second place, in making the inquiry stated in all of the cases, the compatibility of the statutes with the Constitution which was found to exist resulted from particular provisions contained in each of them which so qualified and restricted their operation and necessarily so limited their effect as to lead to such result. These conditions related to the subject-matter upon which the tax was levied, or to the amount of taxes in other respects paid by the corporation, or limitations on the amount of the tax authorized when a much larger amount would have been due upon the basis upon which the tax was apparently levied. It is thus manifest on the face of all of the cases that they in no way sustain the assumption that because a violation of the Constitution was not a large one it would be sanctioned, or that a mere opinion as to the degree of wrong which would arise if the Constitution were violated was treated as affording a measure of the duty of enforcing the Constitution.\n'It follows, therefore, that the cases which the argument relies upon do not in any manner qualify the general principles expounded in the previous cases upon which we have rested our conclusion, since the later cases rested upon particular provisions in each particular case which it was held caused the general and recognized rule not to be applicable.' \n\n[246 U.S. 135, 145]\n\u00a0\n That case and those which it followed and reaffirmed are fully decisive of this. The statutes then and now in question differ only in immaterial details, and the circumstances of their application or attempted application are essentially the same. In principle the cases are not distinguishable.\n\n In holding otherwise the state court failed to observe the restricted and limited grounds of our rulings in Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts and the other cases dealt with and distinguished in the excerpt just quoted from our opinion in Looney v. Crane Company. True, the tax sustained in Baltic Mining Co. v. Massachusetts was imposed under the first of the statutes now in question, the one of 1909; but at that time the statute placed a maximum limit on the amount of the tax which, as shown in that and other cases, was a material factor in the decision. This limitation, as the state court holds, was 'removed' by the statute of 1914, which also made a partial reduction in the tax rate. Since then the tax has been assessed on the par value of 'the entire authorized capital' at one-fiftieth of one per cent. up to $10,000,000 and at one one-hundredth of one per cent. for the excess. Accepting the state court's view of the change wrought by the later statute, it is apparent that since 1914 the Massachusetts law has been in its essential and practical operation like those held invalid in 1910 in Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, Pullman Co. v. Kansas, and Ludwig v. Western Union Telegraph Co., and like that held invalid at the present term in Looney v. Crane Company.\n What has been  id sufficiently shows that the tax in question should have been declared unconstitutional and void as placing a prohibited burden on interstate commerce and laid on property of a foreign corporation located and used beyond the jurisdiction of the state.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIOWA v.

The bill alleges in substance as follows:\n\n\n (1)\n Slimmer, who had for many years been a resident of and domiciled in Iowa, died there testate on August 15, 1917, leaving personal property valued at $550,000, and \n\n[248 U.S. 115, 118]\n\u00a0\n consisting, with the exception of personal effects and a few United States Liberty Bonds, wholly of promissory notes. All of this property, except the personal effects and one note for $3,000, was then in Minnesota in the possession of Slimmer, Jr., who had had custody of the decedent's property for at least five years before his death. The $3,000 note was brought by him and Bechhoefer into Minnesota immediately thereafter.\n\n\n (2)\n For the period of at least five years before his death, Slimmer, Sr., had conspired with Slimmer, Jr., and Bechhoefer to defraud the state of Iowa of taxes which by reason of his domicile in Iowa, might and should have been assessed there against his property during his lifetime; and to this end he had arranged with them that his will (if he should leave one) should be probated in Minnesota, had placed in the custody of Slimmer, Jr., in Minnesota, all his property, except his personal effects and the one note for $3,000, and had concealed his property from the Iowa officials and refused to return the same for taxation there.\n\n\n (3)\n Pursuant to this conspiracy Slimmer, Jr., and Bechhoefer filed his will for probate in Minnesota on or about August 21, 1917, and procured the appointment of Bechhoefer as special administrator, and by falsely claiming that decedent was domiciled there, secured ex parte a finding to that effect, the probate of the will, and the appointment of themselves as executors. From this decree, the defendant Lipman, claiming to be an heir, appealed; and this appeal, which is now pending, has the effect of suspending the decree and leaving the property in the hands of the special administrator. The state of Iowa has not become a party to these proceedings.\n\n\n (4)\n Under the laws of Iowa, omissions to list and assess property may be corrected and the taxes collected within five years from the date of such omission. But the amount properly payable for taxes by Slimmer's estate cannot be \n\n[248 U.S. 115, 119]\n\u00a0\n collected without assessment and levy thereof against his personal representatives, and such assessment and levy must be made within the state of Iowa.\n\n\n (5)\n On January 7, 1918, the district court of Dubuque county, Iowa ( in a proceeding begun apparently on or about that day), decreed, at the instance of the treasurer of that state, that Slimmer, Sr., was domiciled therein and granted to one Mullany letters of administration of his estate. About the same date the state, learning that Slimmer, Jr., and Bechhoefer were about to come into it for the purpose of taking testimony in the Minnesota probate proceedings, obtained from said district court an injunction restraining the witness from testifying and the designated officers from taking their depositions. Slimmer, Jr., and Bechhoefer have not been served in the Iowa suit and have declared their purpose to avoid service within that state.\n The bill prays that it be adjudged and decreed: (a) That Slimmer, Sr., had for more than five years prior to his death been domiciled in Iowa; (b) that his estate consisted of evidences of indebtedness to him and that no part of his estate was, at his death, in Minnesota; (c) that Iowa has and Minnesota has not jurisdiction to administer upon his estate; and prays also (d) that such order be entered as will insure the dismissal of the Minnesota probate proceedings and the administration of the estate in Iowa; and (e) that, pending this suit, an injunction issue restraining the prosecution of the Minnesota probate proceedings.\n The motion for leave to file the bill was submitted ex parte. In view of doubt entertained as to the properiety of granting it, consideration of the application was postponed (as in Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., \n184 U.S. 199\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 308, and Washington v. Northern Securities Co., \n185 U.S. 254\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 623), so that the parties might be heard; and the motion was fully argued orally and upon briefs. Both the state \n\n[248 U.S. 115, 120]\n\u00a0\n of Minnesota and the individual defendants, other than Lipman, objected to the granting of leave to file the bill. The state objected on the grounds that the only effective relief sought was an injunction against a proceeding in a state court; that the Minnesota probate court had exclusive jurisdiction to administer assets of a decedent within its borders, regardless of his domicile; and also that there was no authority granted by the state Legislature for such an action in the federal courts. The individual defendants objected on the grounds that the Iowa administrator was the proper party plaintiff; that he was in any event a necessary party and joining him would oust the court of jurisdiction; that the relief sought would deny to the action of the Minnesota court full faith and credit; and that plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law. The original jurisdiction of the court to entertain a bill of this character was also questioned. Only one of these objections need be considered, for it presents a conclusive reason why leave to file the bill of complaint should be denied.\n Substantially the whole of decedent's estate consisted of notes and bonds. Under an arrangement which had been in force for five years or more, these securities were, at the time of his death, in Minnesota in the custody and possession of an agent resident there. Minnesota imposes inheritance taxes; and its statutes provide (G. S. Minn. 1913,  2281) that no transfer of the property of a nonresident decedent shall be made until the taxes due thereon shall have been paid. Regardless of the domicile of the decedent, these notes and bonds were subject to probate proceedings in that state and likewise subject, at least, to inheritance taxes. G. S. Minn. 1913,  7205, 2271; Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 U.S. 133\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 585; Wheeler v. New York, \n233 U.S. 434\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 607. Furthermore, so far as concerns the property of the decedent, located at his death in Minnesota, the probate courts of \n\n[248 U.S. 115, 121]\n\u00a0\n that state had jurisdiction to determine the domicile. Overby v. Gordon, \n177 U.S. 214\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 603. But even if decedent was not domiciled in Minnesota, its court had the power either to distribute property located there according to the terms of the will applicable thereto, or to direct that it be transmitted to the personal representative of the decedent at the place of his domicile to be disposed of by him. G. S. Minn. 1913,  7278; Harvey v. Richards, 1 Mason, 381, Fed. Cas. No. 6,184. See Wilkins v. Ellett, \n108 \nU.S. 256, 258\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 641.\n On or about August 21, 1917, Slimmer's executors filed their petition in the probate court for Ramsey county, Minn.; and the court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, appointed the defendant Bechhoefer special administrator. As such, he took and now holds, pending an appeal to the state district court, possession of the whole of decedent's estate, consisting of the notes and Liberty Bonds as well as the personal effects. The only effective relief sought here is to enjoin the further administration of the estate of the deceased by the courts of Minnesota. It is clear that the state of Iowa is not entitled to such relief.\n The motion for leave to file the bill of complaint is, therefore, denied. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIRELAND v. WOODS(1918)\nNo. 611\nArgued: March 6, 1918Decided: March 18, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 323, 324]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George W. Wickersham, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Robert S. Johnstone, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A case in interstate rendition. Upon requisition of the Governor of the state of New Jersey, representing that Ireland, plaintiff in error, was charged in that state with the crime of conspiracy and with having fled therefrom and taken refuge in New York, the Governor of the state of New York issued his warrant requiring Ireland to be arrested and delivered to the agent of the state of New Jersey to be taken back to the latter state. By virtue of the warrant defendant in error, Woods, police commissioner of the city of New York, arrested Ireland.\n After his arrest Ireland filed a petition in habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of New York County, State of New York, for his discharge from the custody of Woods, alleging that the arrest was illegal and that he was restrained of his liberty in violation of the provisions of subdivision 2 of section 2, art. 4, of the Constitution of the United States and of section 5278 of the Revised Statutes of the United States ( Comp. St. 1916,  10126). The basis of the charge was that he \n\n[246 U.S. 323, 325]\n\u00a0\n was not within the limits of the state of New Jersey at the times the alleged crimes were said to have been committed, nor was there any evidence, either before the Governor of New Jersey when that officer issued his demand upon the Governor of New York or before the latter when he issued his warrant, that he (Ireland) was within the limits of New Jersey at such times; and therefore it did not appear that he was a fugitive from the justice of New Jersey. And it was charged that it appeared on the face of the indictment that no crime under the laws of New Jersey was alleged or was committed.\n Woods duly made return to the petition, to which were annexed the requisition of the Governor of New Jersey and the warrant of the Governor of New York.\n Ireland traversed the return under oath, and denied that he had committed the crimes charged against him, or any crime; denied that he was within the state at the times that the indictment charged the crimes were committed, which he alleged to be the 1st of January, 9th of June and 12th of July, 1913, or in the state at the time of the finding of the indictment; alleged that he examined a sworn copy of the requisition of the Governor of New Jersey and that it did not contain any evidence or proof that he, Ireland, was in that state on any day in any of the months set forth in the indictment; and he further denied that he was a fugitive from the justice of the state.\n After a hearing, at which the papers which were before the Governor of New York at the time he issued his warrant were introduced in evidence ( over the objection of Ireland), and certain oral testimony, including that of Ireland, an order was entered dismissing the writ. It was successively affirmed by the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals. This writ of error was then sued out.\n It is stated in the opinion of the Appellate Division, Judge Shearn speaking for the court, that the requisition \n\n[246 U.S. 323, 326]\n\u00a0\n was honored upon the production of the necessary parers and that it was not claimed there was no sufficient showing before the Governor to warrant the production of the necessary papers and depending entirely on the testimony that he, Ireland, was only three times in New Jersey, none of which times was charged in the indictment.\n The court did not pass upon or even refer to the charge of the petition that his arrest was in violation of the Constitution of the United States or of section 5278, R. S. It rested its decision upon the sixth count of the indictment and the testimony of Ireland.\n The sixth count charged that the offenses were committed 'on or about the 1st day' of January, 1913, 'and on divers other days between that day and the day of the taking of the inquisition.' And the court rejected the contention made by counsel that this was merely an allegation of a crime committed on January 1st and held that the dates set forth in the count defined a period of time during any part of which the offenses could have been committed, citing Comm. v. Wood, 4 Gray (Mass.) 11; Comm. v. Snow, 14 Gray (Mass.) 20, and held further that the indictment followed the common and accepted form of pleading a continuing conspiracy, adducing Comm. v. Sheehan, 143 Mass. 468, 9 N. E. 839; Comm. v. Briggs, 11 Metc. (Mass.) 573; Comm. v. Dunn, 111 Mass. 426.\n Considering the effect of Ireland's concession that he was present in the state on at least three occasions during the period defined, the court held, upon the authority of certain cases, that there could be no question but that he was a fugitive from justice within the meaning of the extradition law for his presence there was not under conditions which established the impossibility of his participation in the conspiracy; that, although his stay was short on each occasion, there was an abundance of opportunity not only to confer with his alleged confed- \n\n[246 U.S. 323, 327]\n\u00a0\n erates but to hand to them the letters of credit and bogus checks which, it was alleged, were used to accomplish the overt acts.\n It was not considered necessary to pass upon the contentions with respect to the five other counts of the indictment.\n A motion to dismiss is made, the grounds of it being: (1) The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reviewable, if at all, only by certiorari. (2) It is not reviewable at all because under the limitation of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals it had no power to review or decide the question whether there was any evidence to show that Ireland was a fugitive from justice and that the Court of Appeals must be assumed not to have passed upon or to have decided the question whether Ireland was a fugitive from justice. Whether the assumption is justified or not we do not consider, on account of the view we entertain of the first ground of the motion, to which we immediately pass. To sustain it counsel adduces section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended September 6, 1916, chapter 448, 39 Stat. 726. It provides in what cases and how there can be a review of a judgment or decree of a state court by this court. It reads as follows:\n'A final judgment or decree in any suit in the highest court of a state in which a decision in the suit could be had, where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against their validity; or where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of their validity, may be re- examined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court upon a writ of error.'\n\n When, however, the conditions are reverse, that is, when state court judgments affirm the national powers \n\n[246 U.S. 323, 328]\n\u00a0\n against a contention of their invalidity or do not sustain the validity of the state authority against an attack based on federal grounds, there can be review only by certiorari. And the same manner of review is prescribed where any title, right, privilege, or immunity, is claimed under the Constitution or any treaty or statute of, or commission held or authority exercised under, the United States, and the decision is either in favor of or against the claim set up.\n The difference between the remedies is that one (writ of error) is allowed as of right where upon examination it appears that the case is of the class designated in the statute and that the federal question presented is real and substantial and an open one in this court, while the other (certiorari) is granted or refused in the exercise of the court's discretion. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Coming, then, to consider what was involved in the decision of the courts below, it is manifes that the validity of no national enactment or authority was drawn in question nor, in the meaning of the section, the validity of a statute or authority of the state. There is no doubt of the right of the Governor of New Jersey to have demanded of the Governor of New York the extradition of Ireland, nor of the Governor of the latter state to have complied. Indeed, it was the duty of both so to act if the case justified it, and whether there was such justification was the only inquiry and decision of the courts below.\n We said in Champion Lumber Co. v. Fisher, \n227 \nU.S. 445, 451\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 329, that the validity of a statute of the United States or an authority exercised thereunder is drawn in question when the existence or constitutionality or legality of such statute or authority is denied, and the denial forms the subject of direct inquiry. A dispute of the facts upon which the authority was exercised is not a dispute of its \n\n[246 U.S. 323, 329]\n\u00a0\n validity. See, also, Foreman v. Meyer, \n227 U.S. 452\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 331. If there be no dispute about the facts, Hyatt v. People ex rel. Corkran, \n188 U.S. 691\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 456, might apply. And necessarily the same principle and comment are applicable when there is drawn in question the validity of a statute of or authority exercised under a state.\n In opposition to the motion to dismiss, plaintiff in error contends that a writ of error is the proper proceeding to bring to this court for review the final order or judgment of a state court in a habeas corpus proceeding. Undoubtedly, if the proper conditions of review by that writ exist as prescribed in the amended section 237 of the Judicial Code, supra. The argument of counsel to show that such conditions do exist in the instant case is somewhat roundabout. It begins by the assertion that the warrant under which Ireland was held in custody was an exercise of the authority of the state in that it was issued by the Governor pursuant to the provisions of section 827 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of that state. It is not necessary to quote it. It is simply the fulfillment by the state of New York of the Constitution of the United States and, it may be said, of section 5278, R. S. It enjoins the duty upon the Governor, when a requisition is made upon him by the Governon of another state, to issue his warrant for the arrest 'of a fugitive from justice.' It is upon the quoted words (which, we may say in passing, are a paraphrase of the provision of the Constitution of the United States and of section 5278, R. S.) that the argument of counsel dwells and terminates, the persistent contention being that Ireland is not such a fugitive, and that the decision of the Supreme Court at Special Term and in the Appellate Division to the contrary was based on the construction of the New Jersey indictment-a pure question of law, it is contended, and that the effect the court gave to Ireland's presence in the state at the testified times is another question of law. 'These questions \n\n[246 U.S. 323, 330]\n\u00a0\n were reviewable in the Court of Appeals and are open to decision in this court,' is the final insistence of counsel.\n We are unable to assent to the latter part of the insistence. Questions of law which may be raised upon the indictment, the deductions from the facts which may be charged against the action of the Governor, do not impugn it or the validity of the statute which enjoined it. And surely the decisions of the courts of New York, one trial and two appellate, affirming the legality of his action, are not decisions against the validity of the authority he exercised.\n There is a difference between a question of power to pass a law and its construction, and a difference between the endowing of an officer with authority and his erroneous exercise of that authority. As was said by Chief Justice Fuller, speaking for the court in United States v. Lynch, \n137 \nU.S. 280, 285\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 114, 116 [34 L. Ed. 700]:\n'The validity of a statute is not drawn in questi n every time rights claimed under such statute are controverted, nor is the validity of an authority, every time an act done by such authority is disputed.'\n\n We think, therefore, that the writ of error must be and it is\n Dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Twitchell v.

Hays, of Hobart, Okl., James M. Hays, of Okmulgee, Okl., and Lewis C. Lawson, of Holdenville, Okl., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. George S. Ramsey, of Muskogee, Okl., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DE ANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The title to a Creek allotment is here in controversy. The allotment was made under the Act of March 1, 1901, c. 676, 31 Stat. 861, known as the Original Creek Agreement, and the modifying act of June 30, 1902, c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500, known as the Supplemental Creek Agreement. In 1903 the usual tribal deeds, approved by the Secretary of the Interior and passing the full title, were issued to the allottee. In June, 1908, she died intestate, leaving her surviving a father, brothers and sisters, but no mother, husband or issue. The survivors, like the allottee, were enrolled members of the tribe, and all were freedmen. In determining who inherited the land the courts below applied the Oklahoma law of descent existing at the time of the allottee's death (Jefferson v. Cook, 155 Pac. 852); and the question for decision here is whether under the legislation of Congress an Arkansas law, theretofore put in force in the Indian Territory, should have been applied.\n When the allotment was made and the tribal deeds issued the land was in the Indian Territory, but before \n\n[247 U.S. 288, 290]\n\u00a0\n the allottee died that territory and the territory of Oklahoma had become the state of Oklahoma.\n In early times, when allotments in fee simple to individual Indians were made only occasionally, there was no congressional enactment prescribing who should inherit allotted land on the death of the allottee, and in such cases it was held that while the tribal relation continued the applicable rule of descent was to be found in the laws and usages of the tribe, and not in the laws of the state or territory in which the land lay. Jones v. Meehan, \n175 U.S. 1\n, 29-32.1 In actual practice this rule proved unsatisfactory, because the tribal laws and usages were generally crude and often difficult of ascertainment; and so in later allotment acts Congress provided that the descent should be according to the state or territorial law. A notable illustration of what came to be the policy of Congress on the subject is found in the general Allotment Act of February 8, 1887, c. 119, 24 Stat. 388, the fifth section (Comp. St. 1916,  4201) of which says that for a designated period the United States will hold the land in trust for the allottee, 'or, in case of his decease, of his heirs according to the laws of the state or territory where such land is located,' and at the expiration of that period will convey the same in fee to the allottee, 'or his heirs as aforesaid,' and also 'that the law of descent and partition in force in the state or territory where such lands are situate shall apply thereto after patents therefore have been executed and delivered.' True, that act has no direct application to the lands of the Five Civilized Tribes, of which the Creek tribe is one, but it does throw much light on what was intended by the subsequent legislation relating to the descent of those lands when allotted.\n A territorial government never was established in the Indian Territory and it never had a terriorial Legislature. Apart from the tribal laws of the Indians, among which were laws relating to descent and distribution, the only \n\n[247 U.S. 288, 291]\n\u00a0\n laws which became operative there were such as Congress enacted or put in force.\n By acts passed in 1890, 1893, 1897 and 1898, Congress manifested its purpose to allot or divide in severalty the lands of the Five Civilized Tribes with a view to the ultimate creation of a state embracing the Indian Territory; put in force in the territory several statutes of Arkansas, including chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest relating to descent and distribution; provided that those statutes should apply to all persons in the territory, irrespective of race; and substantially abrogated the laws of the several tribes, including those relating to descent and distribution. Acts May 2, 1890, c. 182, 26 Stat. 81,  31; March 3, 1893, c. 209, 27 Stat. 645,  16; June 7, 1897, c. 3, 30 Stat. 83; June 28, 1898, c. 517, 30 Stat. 495,  11 and 26. This was the sit ation when the act of 1901, known as the Original Creek Agreement, was adopted. That act in the course of providing for the allotment in severalty of the lands of the Creeks revived their tribal law of descent and distribution by making it applicable to their allotments (sections 7 and 28). But the revival was only temporary, for the act of 1902, known as the Supplemental Creek Agreement, not only repealed so much of the act of 1901 as gave effect to the tribal law but reinstated the Arkansas law with the qualification that Creek heirs, if there were such, should take to the exclusion of others. \n2\n Washington v. Miller, 235 U. S. \n\n[247 U.S. 288, 292]\n\u00a0\n 422, 425-426, 35 Sup. Ct. 119. The allotment in question was made and the tribal deeds issued shortly after the act of 1902 became effective. And this was followed by the Act of April 28, 1904, c. 1824, 33 Stat. 573,  2, declaring that all statutes of Arkansas theretofore put in force in the Indian Territory should be taken 'to embrace all persons and estates in said territory whether Indian, freedmen, or otherwise.'\n Referring to the purpose with which the Arkansas statutes were put in force in that territory and to their status there, this court said in Shulthis v. McDougal, \n225 \nU.S. 561, 571\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 704, 707 (56 L. Ed. 1205):\n'Congress was then contemplating the early inclusion of that territory in a new state, and the purpose of those acts was to provide, for the time being, a body of laws adapted to the needs of the locality and its people in respect of matters of local or domestic concern. There being no local Legislature, Congress alone could act. Plainly, its action was intended to be merely provisional . ...'\n\n By the Enabling Act of June 16, 1906, c. 3335, 34 Stat. 267, provision was made for admitting into the Union both the territory of Oklahoma and the Indian Territory as the state of Oklahoma. Each territory had a distinct body of local laws. Those in the Indian Territory, as we have seen, had been put in force there by Congress. Those in the territory of Oklahoma had been enacted by the territorial Legislature. Deeming it better that the new state should come into the Union with a body of laws applying with practical uniformity throughout the state, Congress provided in the Enabling Act (section 13) that 'the laws in force in the territory of Oklahoma, as far as appli- \n\n[247 U.S. 288, 293]\n\u00a0\n cable, shall extend over and apply to said state until changed by the Legislature thereof,' and also (section 21) that 'all laws in force in the territory of Oklahoma at the time of the admission of said state into the Union shall be in force throughout said state, except as modified or changed by this act or by the Constitution of the state.' The people of the state, taking the same view, provided in their Constitution (article 25,  2) that 'all laws in force in the territory of Oklahoma at the time of the admission of the state into the Union, which are not repugnant to this Constitution, and which are not locally inapplicable, shall be extended to and remain in force in the state of Oklahoma until they expire by their own limitation or are altered or repealed by law.'\n The state was admitted into the Union November 16, 1907; and thereupon the laws of the territory of Oklahoma relating to descent and distribution (Rev. Stat. Okl. 1903, c. 86, art. 4) became laws of the state. Thereafter Congress, by the Act of May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312,  9, recognized and treated 'the laws of descent and distribution of the state of Oklahoma' as applicable to the lands allotted to members of the Five Civilized Tribes.\n As before indicated, the allottee died in June, 1908, and the courts below in determining who inherited the land from her gave effect to the state law of Oklahoma existing at the time of her death.\n Two objections to that ruling are pressed on our attention: One that the allotment was made and the tribal deeds issued under the act of 1902, which contained a provision that the descent should be according to the Arkansas law, and that thereby those who would be heirs under that law became invested with a right to inherit which could not be taken away or impaired by subsequent legislation, either federal or state; and the other that, even if Congress possessed the power to substitute \n\n[247 U.S. 288, 294]\n\u00a0\n some other law of descent, that power was not exercised. Both objections are untenable.\n Through congressional action the Arkansas law found in chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest had become the local law of descent in the Indian Territory, and when the act of 1902 provided that the descent of Creek allotments should be in accordance with that chapter, it was but another way of saying that the descent should be in accordance with the local law. In other words, that act was made to conform to the general policy of Congress in respect of the descent of Indian allotments. Other provisions dealt with the estate which the allottee was to receive and showed that it was to be a fee simple. What was said about the rules of descent was purely legislative, not contractual; and its presence in the act gave it no effect that it would not have had as a separate enactment. Like other rules of descent it was subject to change by the law-making power as to any land not already passed to the heir by the death of the owner. Not until the ancestor dies is there any vested right in the heir. Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (7th Ed.) 512.\n We have seen that Congress was accustomed to subjecting allotted Indian lands to the local laws of descent, and also that its action in putting the Arkansas law in force in the Indian Territory was intended to be merely provisional. With this in mind it seems very plain that the provisions before quoted from the Enabling Act were intended to result, at the time of the admission of the new state, in the substitution of the Oklahoma law of descent for that of Arkansas theretofore put in force in the Indian Territory. The recognition given to the Oklahoma law by Congress in the act of 1908 hardly can be explained on any other theory.\n It well may be, as held below, that the qualification which Congress placed on the application of the local \n\n[247 U.S. 288, 295]\n\u00a0\n law-then the Arkansas law-by the act of 1902 equally qualifies the application of the Oklahoma law (Washington v. Miller, \n235 U.S. 422\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 119), but that question is not here, for the survivors of the allottee are all Creek citizens.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 20 Sup. Ct. 1. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The repealing and reinstating portion of the act was as follows:\n'6. The provisions of the act of Congress approved March 1, 1901 , ... in so far as they provide for descent and distribution according to the laws of the Creek Nation, are hereby repealed and the descent and distribution of land and money provided for by said act shall be in accordance with chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas now in force in Indian Territory: Provided, that only citizens of the Creek Nation, male and female, and their Creek descendants shall inherit lands of the Creek Nation; and provided further, that if there be no person of Creek citizenship to take the descent and distribution of said estate, then the inheritance shall go to noncitizen heirs in the order named in said chapter 49.'\n\n There was a like provision, but without the provisos, in the Act of May 27, 1902, c. 888, 32 Stat. 258. \n\n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJIM BUTLER TONOPAH MIN. CO. v. WEST END CONSOL. MIN. CO.(1918)\nNo. 249\nArgued: Decided: June 10, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 450, 451]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Curtis H. Lindley, of San Francisco, Cal., and Hugh H. Brown, of Tonopah, Nev., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[247 U.S. 450, 452]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. H. Dickson, of Salt Lake City, Utah, S. S. Downer, of Reno, Nev., A. C. Ellis, Jr., of Salt Lake City, Utah, Peck, Bunker & Cole, of Oakland, Cal., and H. H. Atkinson, of Tonopah, Nev., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the owner of two lode mining claims, the Eureka and the Curtis, to enjoin the owner of an adjoining lode claim, the West End, from exercising an asserted extralateral right in respect of a vein extending beneath the surface from the latter claim into the others. All the claims are patented and their ownership is conceded. The Eureka adjoins the West End on the south and the Curtis lies immediately south of the Eureka. The state courts, both trial and appellate, upheld the defendant's asserted right to follow the vein extralaterally (39 Nev. 375, 158 Pac. 876), and the plaintiff seeks a reversal of that decision on the theory that it is in contravention of the mining laws of Congress, in that ( a) the end lines of the West End claim are not parallel and straight, and therefore an essential element of the right to follow the vein extralaterally is wanting; (b) this right can be exercised only in one direction, that is, beyond one side line, not both, and as the discovery vein1 dips to the north the \n\n[247 U.S. 450, 453]\n\u00a0\n right can be exercised only in that direction; and (c) the facts specially found do not show that the top or apex of the vein is within the vertical limits of the West End claim.\n For present purposes the West End claim may be described as having the form of a parallelogram 1,500 feet in length from east to west and 600 feet in width from north to south, but with a small portion of the northeast corner cut off by a diagonal line and a somewhat larger portion of the southwest corner similarly cut off. See diagram, 39 Nev. 375, 158 Pac. 876. Thus what would be the end lines of the parallelogram, if it were complete, are substantially shortened, but the major part of each remains. These shortened lines are not only parallel, but straight. Are they the end lines of the claim in the sense of the statute? Or do its end lines consist of the shortened lines and the diagonal lines? End lines in the sense of the statute are those which are laid across the vein to show how much of it, in point of length, is appropriated and claimed by the miner. All other lines are side lines. True, the end lines must be both parallel and straight. Rev. Stat.  2320, 2322 (Comp. St. 1916,  4615, 4618); Walrath v. Champion Mining Co., \n171 \nU.S. 293, 311\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 909. But it is not so with the side lines. They may have angles and elbows and be converging or diverging, so long as their general course is along the vein and the statutory restriction on the width of claims is respected. Del Monte Mining Co. v. Last Chance Mining Co., \n171 \nU.S. 55, 84\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 895. Applying these tests to the bounding lines of the West End claim, we regard it as plain that the diagonal lines at the two corners are part of its side lines, and not of its end lines. In this respect the case is like Walrath v. Champion Mining Co., supra, where in determining what was the northerly end line of the Providence claim (see diagram, \n171 U.S. 298\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 909), the line g, h, was held to be the true end line and the diagonal line f, g, to be no part of it. Thus the objection that \n\n[247 U.S. 450, 454]\n\u00a0\n the end lines of the West End claim are not parallel and straight is untenable.\n What in mining cases is termed the extralateral right is a creation of the mining laws of Congress, and to learn what it is we must look to them rather than o some system of law to which it is a stranger. Besides, as Congress has plenary power over the disposal of the mineral-bearing public lands, it rests with it to say to what extent, if at all, the right to pursue veins on their downward course into the earth shall pass to and be reserved for those to whom it grants possessory or other titles in such lands. What it has said is this (Rev. Stat.  2322 [Comp. St. 1916,  4618 ]):\n'The locators of all mining locations ... on any mineral vein, lode, or ledge, situated on the public domain, their heirs and assigns , ... shall have the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the surface included within the lines of their locations, and of all veins, lodes, and ledges throughout their entire depth, the top or apex of which lies inside of such surface lines extended downward vertically, although such veins, lodes, or ledges may so far depart from a perpendicular in their course downward as to extend outside the vertical side lines of such surface locations. But their right of possession to such outside parts of such veins or ledges shall be confined to such portions thereof as lie between vertical planes drawn downward as above described, through the end lines of their locations, so continued in their own direction that such planes will intersect such exterior parts of such veins or ledges.'\n\n It will be seen that the extralateral right so created is subject to three limitations. One conditions it on the presence of the top or apex inside the boundaries of the claim. Another restricts it to the dip or course downward, and so excludes the strike or onward course along the top or apex. And the last confines it to such outside parts as lie between the end lines continued outwardly in their own \n\n[247 U.S. 450, 455]\n\u00a0\n direction and extended vertically downward. But otherwise it is without limitation or exception and broadly includes 'all veins, lodes and ledges throughout their entire depth'-one as much as another, and all whether they depart through one side line or the other. Given two veins which in their descent pass, one through one side line and the other through the other side line, how could it be held that the right applies to one vein and not to the other, when the statute says 'all veins ... throughout their entire depth'? By what rule would a court be guided in making a selection between the two when the statute makes none? And where a single vein in its descent separates into two limbs which depart through the opposite side lines, on what theory could the right be sustained as to one limb and rejected as to the other? The terms of the statute, as we think, do not lend themselves to any such distinctions, but, on the contrary, show that none such is intended.\n In Mining Co. v. Tarbet, \n98 U.S. 463\n, 467 (25 L. Ed. 253), this court in pointing out the intent of the statute said that 'the end lines are to cross the lode and extend perpendicularly downwards, and to be continued in their own direction either way horizontally.' And in Del Monte Mining Co. v. Last Chance Mining Co., \n171 \nU.S. 55, 88\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 895, 908 (43 L. Ed. 72), a case in which the statute was much considered, it was said:\n'Every vein whose apex is within the vertical limits of his surface lines passes to him by virtue of his location. He is not limited to only those veins which extend from one end line to another, or from one side line to another, or from one line of any kind to another, but he is entitled to every vein whose top or apex lies within his surface lines. Not only is he entitled to all veins whose apexes are within such limits, but he is entitled to them throughout their entire depth, 'although such veins, lodes or ledges may so far depart from a perpendicular in their course downward as to extend outside the vertical side \n\n[247 U.S. 450, 456]\n\u00a0\n lines of such surface locations.' In other words, given a vein whose apex is within his surface limits he can pursue that vein as far as he pleases in its downward course outside the vertical side line .'\n\n And again (\n171 U.S. 89\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 908):\n'The locator is given a right to pursue any vein, whose apex is within his surface limits, on its dip outside the vertical side lines, but may not in such pursuit go beyond the vertical end lines.'\n\n In Calhoun Gold Mining Co. v. Ajax Gold Mining Co., \n182 U.S. 499\n, at page 508, 21 Sup. Ct. 885, 890 (45 L. Ed. 1200), it was added:\n'There are no exceptions to its language. The locators 'of any mineral veins, lode or ledge' are given not only 'an exclusive right of possession and enjoyment' of all the surface included within the lines of their locations, but 'of all veins, lodes and ledges throughout their entire depth, the top or apex of which lies inside of such surface lines extended downward vertically.' A locator therefore is not confined to the vein upon which he based his location and upon which the discovery was made.'\n\n And also (\n182 U.S. 509\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 890):\n'Blind veins are not excepted, and we cannot except them. They are included in the description 'all veins' and belong to the surface location.'\n\n We conclude therefore that, when the other elements of the extralateral right are present, it may be exercised beyond either or both side lines depending on the direction which the departing vein or veins take in their downward course.\n So much of the special finding as bears on the character of the vein and the presence of its top or apex inside the vertical lines of the West End claim is as follows:\n'The said vein does not on its upward course, or at its top or apex, outcrop or reach the present surface, but is covered or buried to a considerable depth by lava, locally known as and called 'midway' andesite, which, after the formation of the vein, flowed over the then surface of the territory in which the vein exists; that at and for a distance of 360 feet westerly from where said vein \n\n[247 U.S. 450, 457]\n\u00a0\n or lode crosses the easterly end line of said West End claim, which crossing is at a distance of 135 feet northerly from the southeast corner of said West End claim, there is a juncture or union between two limbs or sides of said vein, and from the summit of said juncture or union the downward course of one limb or side thereof is in a northerly direction, and the downward course of the other limb or side thereof is in a southerly direction; that there is a continuation upward from the summit of said juncture or union of said northerly and southerly dipping limbs or sides of said vein of ore and silver-bearing quartz or rock in place for a distance from 20 or 30 to more than 100 feet, and to what was the surface before the same was buried beneath the said lava flow; that such ore and silver- bearing quartz were deposited where the same are now found at the same time and during the same period that the main vein below was created, and from mineral-bearing solutions having the same source; that the dip is fairly conformable, and the strike or course of such upward continuation of ore and silver-bearing quartz is conformable, to the dip and strike or course of said northerly-dipping limb or side of said vein from the summit of said juncture downward, and the court finds that said upward continuation is a part of said vein or lode; that thence westerly, and for a distance of 360 feet, the northerly and southerly dipping limbs, sides, or slopes of said vein do not unite or form a union or juncture in their upward course, but for that distance each of said limbs or sides has a separate and independent top or apex; that thence westerly, for a distance of 40 feet, the northerly and southerly dipping limbs, sides, or slopes of said vein are again found in conjunction, as in the said most easterly 360 feet; that thence westerly, and until said northerly and southerly dipping limbs, sides, or slopes of said vein intersect with and cross said northerly side line of said mining claim, they do not unite or form a union or junc- \n\n[247 U.S. 450, 458]\n\u00a0\n ture in their upward course, but for that distance2 each of said limbs or ides has a separate and independent top or apex; that between said distance of 40 feet, where said northerly and southerly dipping limbs, sides, or slopes of said vein, as aforesaid, unite or form a union or juncture in their course upward, and said points on said northerly side line of said mining claim where, as aforesaid, said contra-dipping limbs, sides or slopes of said vein respectively intersect said side line and cross the same and so depart from said mining claim, there are two points at which it appears that said contra-dipping limbs, sides or slopes of said vein on their upward course approach closely to a juncture or union, but as to said contra- dipping limbs, sides, or slopes of said vein at said two points actually forming a juncture or union on their upward course, the evidence is meager and unsatisfactory; that the point where the said northerly dipping limb or side of said vein departs from the said mining claim through the northerly side line thereof is 1,120 feet westerly from the northeast corner of said claim, measured along the northerly side line thereof; that the point where said southerly dipping limb or side of said vein departs from said mining claim through the northerly side line thereof is 1,142 1\/2 feet westerly from the northeast corner of said claim, measured along the northerly side line thereof; that throughout said distance of 40 feet, where the contra-dipping limbs or sides of said vein are found in conjunction, as hereinbefore stated, there is a continuation upward from the summit of the juncture or union of said two limbs or sides of said vein of ore or vein quartz to what was the surface before the same was covered by the lava flow; that the dip or downward course of both the northerly and southerly dipping sides or limbs of the vein where the two are found in conjunction, as aforesaid, and also in the places where each, as aforesaid, \n\n[247 U.S. 450, 459]\n\u00a0\n has its separate and independent top or apex, is regular and practically free from undulations; that the said southerly dipping limb or side of the vein in the easterly portion of the West End claim, that is to say, the easterly 360 feet thereof, has been developed from the top or summit of said juncture of said contra- dipping limbs to and beyond the southerly side line of said claim, or for a distance, measured on the slope or downward course of said southerly dipping limb or side, of 800 feet or thereabouts, the average dip there being 17 degrees from the horizontal; that the westerly portion, that is to say, the westerly 300 feet of said southerly dipping limb or side of said vein found in the West End claim, has been developed from its top to and beyond the southerly side line of said claim, or for a distance, measured on its slope or downward course, of 1,000 feet or thereabouts, the average dip there being 30 degrees from the horizontal; that the average dip of said northerly dipping limb or side of said vein, so far as the same has been developed in its downward course, is 17 degrees from the horizontal; that said vein is a fissure vein; that there is a difference in the strikes or courses of said northerly and southerly dipping limbs of said vein of about 40 degrees; that at said places and throughout said distances, where said contra-dipping limbs of said vein are found to intersect and form a juncture, as aforesaid, there has been a mingling of the mineralizations of said two limbs of said vein within the angle beneath the juncture of the said two limbs; that at such places and throughout said distances the footwall of said two limbs of said vein, within the angle beneath their said juncture, by the process of replacement has been converted into mineralized quartz for considerable distances below said juncture, said replacement quartz extending from limb to limb.'\n\n Giving due effect to the finding, it is manifest that the vein in controversy is not a flat or horizontal vein or one \n\n[247 U.S. 450, 460]\n\u00a0\n which would be practically horizontal but for a succession of rolls or waves in its el vation. On the contrary, it is shown to be a fissure vein with two dipping limbs whose course downward is substantial, regular and practically free from undulations. For 750 feet out of its total length of 1,150 feet within the West End claim each limb is practically a separate vein with a distinct summit or terminal edge. For the remaining 400 feet the two limbs are united and from the point of union the mineralized quartz or rock continues upward for from 20 or 30 to more than 100 feet, and this seems to answer all the calls of a summit or terminal edge. In these circumstances we hardly would be warranted in saying as matter of law that the vein has no top or apex within the claim in the sense of the statute. See Stewart Mining Co. v. Ontario Mining Co., \n237 U.S. 350\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 610.\n It is well to remember, as this court has indicated in other mining cases, that to take from the discoverer a portion of that which he has discovered and give it to one who may have been led to make an adjoining location by a knowledge of the discovery is unreasonable.\n The contention is not that the top or apex of this vein has been found elsewhere, but only that what is found in the West End claim is not such in the sense of the statute. 'The law,' as has been truly said, 'assumes that the lode has a top, or apex, and provides for the acquisition of title by location upon this apex.' Probably this assumption could not be indulged where the fact appeared to be otherwise, but it serves to show that the absence of a top or apex ought not to be adjudged in the presence of such a finding as we have here.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The discovery was on the northerly limb hereinafter described. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Approaching 400 feet. \n\n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHNSON v. LANKFORD(1918)\nNo. 96\nArgued: Decided: January 28, 1918\n\n\n\n Action for the sum of $5,235.60, with interest, for the failure of defendant in error Lankford to perform his duty as bank commissioner of Oklahoma, in consequence of which plaintiff in error sustained loss in the amount stated. Southwestern Surety Insurance Company, an Oklahoma corporation, was surety on the official bond of Lankford.\n Defendants, defendants in error here, moved to dismiss the action on the ground of want of jurisdiction in the court, the action being 'one against the state of Oklahoma without its consent, in violation of the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.'\n The court granted the motion, reciting that it was upon \n\n[245 U.S. 541, 542]\n\u00a0\n the ground stated and that the question of jurisdiction was alone involved in its decision, and subsequently allowed a writ of error to review that question only.\n Plaintiff in error (we shall refer to him as plaintiff) is a citizen of the state of Massachusetts. The defendants in error are citizens of the state of Oklahoma.\n The petition of plaintiff is, in outline, as follows:\n Lankford, in March, 1911, then being bank commissioner of Oklahoma, and again in March, 1915, entered into official bonds with the insurance company as surety in the sum of $25,000 for the faithful performance of his duties as required by law.\n On October 11, 1913, the Farmers' & Merchants' Bank of Mountain View, Okl., a domestic banking corporation under the control and supervision of Lankford as bank commissioner, for value received, executed and delivered to plaintiff a certificate of deposit for the sum of $5,066.66, with interest at 3 per cent.\n February 20, 1915, Lankford, as bank commissioner, took possession of the bank, and of its assets because of its insolvency. Thereupon plaintiff indorsed the certificate to one Martin for collection, who presented the same to Lankford for paymen . Payment being refused, Martin reindorsed the same to plaintiff. Under the terms of the bonds given by Lankford it was his duty as commissioner to pay the certificate of deposit at the time it was presented to him. By refusal to so pay it, and his refusal afterward to pay upon the demand of plaintiff, he, Lankford, grossly and entirely failed to perform his duty, and being informed of the conditions of the bank and having means of knowledge he allowed the persons in charge of it to squander its assets so as to damage plaintiff in his right to compel payment from the bank. He, Lankford, also failed to exercise proper care and supervision in that before the making of the certificate of deposit and thence continuously up to the time he took possession of the bank, \n\n[245 U.S. 541, 543]\n\u00a0\n with full knowledge of the situation, he permitted the persons in charge of it to conduct it while its reserve was less than that required by law, and failed to take possession of it for the purpose of enforcing the law, or to do anything else adequate and requisite in the premises. He also permitted it while insolvent to make excessive loans and overdrafts in violation of law. And, knowing that it was in the hands of incompetent and inefficient persons, he allowed it to be controlled and managed by them inefficiently and incompetently and without economy, to the great damage of its assets, and plaintiff thereby was deprived of all opportunity of recovering the amount of his certificate out of its property.\n Lankford failed to make the visits to the bank which the law of the state required him to make or exact the reports which the law required him to exact. He permitted it to reduce the funds which the law required it to have and failed to notify it of the deficiencies or to require it to repair them.\n It was his duty to have taken possession of the bank, but he delayed to do so until February, 1915, when its assets were so squandered and depleted as to be insufficient to pay plaintiff's claim. He knew of the violations of law by its officers and of its insolvency.\n It was his duty after he took possession to pay plaintiff's claim but he arbitrarily and capriciously refused, in violation of law and his bonds, and there was no cause whatever for him to have questioned the certificate as a valid claim against the guaranty fund of the state, which was available under the law of the state for the payment of claims against the bank.\n The laws of the state have been so interpreted and enforced by him as to deny plaintiff the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and he has exercised this power so arbitrarily and capriciously that other depositors \n\n[245 U.S. 541, 544]\n\u00a0\n of the same class and condition of plaintiff have been paid out of the available cash resources of the bank and the guaranty fund, and because the state is immune from suit plaintiff has no remedy by judicial review and Lankford, acting for the state as bank commissioner, has deprived plaintiff of his property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States by illegally preferring other depositors to plaintiff, thereby breaching the obligation of his bonds.\n By failure to perform the promises made for the benefit of plaintiff in the bonds, he has been damaged by defendants in the sum of $5,235.60, on February 20, 1915, together with 6 per cent. interest thereon, amounting, August 20, 1915, to the sum of $5,392.67.\n Plaintiff was without knowledge of the delinquencies of Lankford and the condition of the bank and, without fault on his part, allowed the moneys represented by the certificate to remain in the bank after the same became due.\n Judgment was prayed for the amounts above specified.\n Mr. Charles West, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Whether the District Court had jurisdiction was necessarily to be determined by reference to the case made by the petition. Hence we have given it at some length, omitting repetitions. It will be observed that the basis of the action is the neglect of duty of Lankford as bank commissioner, by which plaintiff has been damaged to the amount of his certificate of deposit. The insurance com- \n\n[245 U.S. 541, 545]\n\u00a0\n pany has been made a party defendant because it has guaranteed the faithful performance of his duties, a statute of the state, it is contended, making it liable. Whether the contention is tenable or whether the petition or the case is defective in any particular we are not called upon to say. Upon neither question was the judgment of the District Court defensively invoked. The sole question for our consideration then is whether the cause of action stated is one against the state of which the District Court has no jurisdiction.\n There is certainly no assertion of state action or liability upon the part of the state, and no relief is prayed against it. The charges are all against Lankford. The relief sought is against him because of his willful or negligent disregard of the laws of the state, and it is because of this his surety is charged with liability, it having guaranteed his fidelity.\n We think the question, therefore, should be answered in the negative; that is, that the action is not one against the state. To answer it otherwise would be to assert, we think, that whatever an officer does, even in contravention of the laws of the state, is state action, identifies him with it and makes the redress sought against him a claim against the state and therefore prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment. Surely an officer of a state may be delinquent without involving the state in delinquency, indeed, may injure the state by delinquency as well as some resident of the state, and be amenable to both.\n The case is not like Lankford v. Platte Iron Works, \n235 U.S. 461\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 173. There the effort was to compel the payment of a claim (certificates of deposit issued by a bank) out of the fund to which the state had a title and which it administered through its officers. Any demand upon it was a demand upon the state and a suit to enforce the demand was a suit against the state, necessarily precluded by the purpose of the law. The case at bar is not of such \n\n[245 U.S. 541, 546]\n\u00a0\n character. Its basis is Lankford's dereliction of duty, a duty enjoined by the laws of the state, and the dereliction is charged to have been continuous, overlooking violations of the requirements of law by the bank officials by which it was brought to insolvency, knowing of the depletion of its assets, knowing of the reduction of its reserves, and not requiring their repair. A further dereliction is charged after Lankford took possession and such arbitrary conduct and preferences that plaintiff's claim was subordinated to other claims of like character.\n The present case finds example in Hopkins v. Clemson College, \n221 U.S. 636\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 654, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 243, where the college was held liable for acts of trespass upon private property, and it was said by Mr. Justice Lamar, speaking for the court, that immunity from suit was a 'high attribute of sovereignty-a prerogative of the state itself-which cannot be availed of by public agents when sued for their own torts.' And it was further said, 'The Eleventh Amendment was not intended to afford them [public agents] freedom from liability in any case where, under color of their office, they have injured one of the state's citizens.' And a distinction was marked between such acts and such as affect the state's political or property rights.\n One charge in the petition will justify special comment. It is that the enforcement of the laws of Oklahoma in the matters complained of was and is solely through and by Lankford as bank commissioner and that he so arbitrarily and capriciously exercised his powers as to deprive plaintiff of the equal protection of the laws and to give to 'other depositors an unequal and more advantageous enforcement of the law than to plaintiff, this to plaintiff's damage.' And also it is alleged that Lankford's conduct in that particular deprived plaintiff of his property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n The purpose of the allegations is not very clear. They \n\n[245 U.S. 541, 547]\n\u00a0\n might be considered as intended for emphasis of the wrongful conduct of Lankford; but they seem to be made more of than this in the argument of counsel, and we are left in doubt whether they are pleaded as independent grounds of recovery or only as elements with other grounds. It is somewhat impossible to regard them as the former, for no special relief is asked on account of them. They represent completed acts the injury of which has been accomplished, the plaintiff losing by them access to the guaranty fund or its security, and hence Lankford is charged with personal liability. But no relief, as we have said, is prayed against the fund. If it were, Lankford v. Platte Iron Works, supra, might apply.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","80":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJONES v.

It appears that the appellant, a citizen of Indiana, having effected his escape from an \n\n[245 U.S. 510, 512]\n\u00a0\n insane asylum in Wisconsin was taken by his family and friends to Oak Grove for medical care and treatment in May, 1906; and that directly thereafter a petition asking an inquisition concerning his sanity was duly presented to the probate court by the superintendent of that institution as provided by a state statute. After a hearing he was adjudged insane and committed for treatment; the right to appeal was not exercised. In October, 1906, he escaped, and this bill was filed May 11, 1912 without prior application for relief to any court of the state. It prays (1) that defendants be required to give an account of and restore to complainant all writings, letters, documents and papers placed in their hands in connection with the inquisition, and (2) that the judge and register of the probate court be required to set aside and hold for naught the pretended inquisition in insanity and make adequate entry accordingly on the record.\n All equities of the bill are fully denied in the answer; and the claim that the cause really involves construction or application of the federal Constitution is without foundation.\n We have no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and it must be\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKING v.

Krueger for the cancellation of a certain patent upon public lands in Colorado.\n The government alleged in its bill that the land eighty ac res, patented to William E. Moses June 6, 1910, upon a soldiers' additional homestead entry (U. S. Rev. Stats.  2306, 2307 [Comp. St. 1916,  4594, 4602]; Act Aug. 18, 1894, c. 301,  1, 28 Stat. 397 [Comp. St. 1916,  4601]), had been secured by means of false affidavits, one by the entryman, Moses, who had made oath that the land was unoccupied, unimproved, and unappropriated by any person other than himself, and the other by John. A. McIntyre, that the land was not in any manner occupied adversely to the selector; whereas in truth and in fact the land had been for several years previously in the open and notorious possession of one P. C. Benson under title deraigned from the Denver Pacific Railway & Telegraph Company under a land grant of Congress made July 1, 1862. It was also charged that the fraud was perpetrated by agreement between Moses, the entryman, and one C. M. Krueger, the husband of the defendant, Emma T. Krueger. It is charged in the bill that Mrs. Krueger took the conveyance through Moses and her husband with notice of the fraud and without consideration.\n Upon issue joined and the allegation of the answer that the defendant was a purchaser in good faith without notice of any fraud, the District Court found that the patent had been obtained by fraud, but that Mrs. Krueger was a bona fide purchaser without notice, and as such entitled to hold the land. The Court of Appeals took the same view of the evidence as to the fraudulent manner in which the land was acquired, and reached the conclu- \n\n[246 U.S. 69, 74]\n\u00a0\n sion that the patent should be set aside for fraud committed against the United States unless the defendant had shown that she was an innocent purchaser without notice.\n With some hesitation the Circuit Court of Appeals reached the conclusion that Mrs. Krueger at the time she purchased the land must be held to have had constructive notice of facts which, if investigated, would have led her to the knowledge of the fraud, and that she was not entitled as a bona fide purchaser to hold the land as against the government. 228 Fed. 97, 142 C. C. A. 503.\n It was stipulated by the parties for the purposes of the trial as follows:\n'By Act of Congress of July 1, 1862 (12 Stat. 489), Congress granted to the Leavenworth, Pawnee & Western Railroad Company, a right of way over certain public lands, and also certain public lands to aid in the construction of said railroad. That under and by virtue of a certain Act of Congress of March 3, 1869, the Denver Pacific Railway & Telegraph Company became the owner of and entitled to all the rights and benefits so granted and conferred by said Act of Congress of July 1, 1862, and said company selected and definitely located its said right of way, on August 20, 1869, and so selecte and definitely located and fixed its said right of way as to bring the lands involved in this suit within the primary limits of said grant. On April 13, 1866, Robert W. Woodward filed a certain valid pre-emption declaratory statement, numbered 2094, as provided for in the Act of Congress dated September 4, 1841 (5 Stat. 455), for the lands hereinabove described (unoffered lands), upon which final proof and payment was never made, that said declaratory statement was a valid and subsisting claim on August 20, 1869, and all rights under and by virtue of said preemption filing of said Woodward expired by operation of law on July 14, 1872, up to which date said filing was a valid and subsisting filing.' \n\n[246 U.S. 69, 75]\n\u00a0\n The land was part of one of the oddnumbered sections named in the land grant and was opposite the constructed part of the road. April 5, 1871, the Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company sold and conveyed the land to one James Langston. Thence by mesne conveyances the land passed to Perry C. Benson, April 6, 1904\n\n\n\n The pendency of Woodward's filing prevented the title from vesting in the railroad company, for it caused the land to be excepted from the grant. Kansas Pacific Ry. Co. v. Dunmeyer, \n113 U.S. 629\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 566.\n A copy of the abstract of title showing the chain of title from the Denver Pacific Railway & Telegraph Company to Perry C. Benson was stipulated into the record; the abstract also showing the chain of title to and including the purchase by Mrs. Krueger of one half interest in the land from C. M. Krueger.\n Benson paid $1,375 for the land, and both courts found that he was and continued to be in possession of the land with the title of record as stated, and that Mrs. Krueger would be held to have knowledge of his rights, certainly as between herself and Benson. We have no doubt from the facts found that Benson had such possession and occupation of the premises as gave at least constructive notice of the nature and extent of his title. Under the Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 556, c. 376,  5 (Comp. St. 1916 ,  4899) and the regulations of the Land Department he would have been entitled upon hearing in the department to purchase the lands and acquire full title thereto upon complying with the statute. Section 5 of the act, and the regulations of the Land Department are given in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[246 U.S. 69, 76]\n\u00a0\n The turning question in the case is: Was Mrs. Krueger a bona fide purchaser in such sense that she can hold the land notwithstanding the fraudulent manner in which it was acquired by the entryman Moses for the benefit of Krueger? That Krueger had actual knowledge of Benson's claim to the premises admits of no doubt. As early as August 3, 1907, Krueger wrote to Benson:\n'Upon a search of the records, I find that you are the present owner of the W\/2NE\/4, Sec. 17, Tp. 5 N, R 69 West of the 6th P. M. (the tract in controversy), and that the title thereto is imperfect. If you are sufficiently interested, I would be pleased to correspond with you relative to the matter and assist you in curing the defect.\n\n'My charges will be reasonable.'\n\n Krueger had been chief clerk of the United States Land Office at Denver until February 12, 1907, and thereafter practiced as an attorney in land and mining matters at Denver. Moses procured the soldier's additional homestead right upon which the entry was made, and made the entry at the request of Krueger who had bought the soldier's additional right from Moses for $780. Moses deeded the land to Krueger, and never claimed any interest in it. The Land Department's regulations required \n\n[246 U.S. 69, 77]\n\u00a0\n an affidavit that the land located or selected was not in any manner occupied adversely to the locator or selector. Moses obtained a receiver's receipt upon April 8, 1910, and conveyed by deed to Krueger April 15, 1910. On April 22, 1910, Krueger conveyed to Mrs. Krueger and Mrs. McIntyre, the wife of one who had made a corroborating affidavit also containing the statement that t e land was not in any manner occupied adversely to the selector. The patent was issued to Moses June 6, 1910, and on April 22, 1913, Mrs. McIntyre conveyed her one-half interest in the premises to Mrs. Krueger. Mrs. Krueger testified that she paid her husband $400 in cash for the undivided one-half interest, and that she paid Mrs. McIntyre $1,500 by check for her one-half interest. She testifies that when she bought from her husband after final receipt, and before the patent issued, she had not seen the land and knew nothing about it, and did not in fact see it until March 27, 1913; that she knew nothing about the statements made in the affidavit signed by Moses or the affidavit of McIntyre; that before she purchased the interest of Mrs. McIntyre she had been upon the land and found there a Mrs. Benson, who said that her father-in law was P. C. Benson, and that she and her husband were farming the land.\n But we need not dwell upon any inferences which may arise from the relationship between Mrs. Krueger and her husband and her actual knowledge of Benson's possession, for we think the Circuit Court of Appeals was right in reaching the conclusion that Mrs. Krueger had at least constructive notice of the manner in which the land had been obtained from the government. If the affidavit of Moses had truthfully stated the possession of Benson, Benson would have had an opportunity to claim his rights under the Act of March 3, 1887, and the regulations of the Land Department. From the receiver's receipt, which was the evidence of title of record when \n\n[246 U.S. 69, 78]\n\u00a0\n Mrs. Krueger obtained the deed from her husband, she was bound to know that the land had been obtained upon an affidavit of Moses asserting that the land was not occupied adversely. Under the decisions of this court she was chargeable with notice from Benson's possession, and his record title from the railroad company, that he had a preferential right of purchase under the Act of March 3, 1887. Gertgens v. O'Connor, \n191 \nU.S. 237, 246\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 94; Ramsey v. Tacoma Land Co., \n196 \nU.S. 360, 364\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 286. Having such notice of the origin of the title under which she had purchased, she was chargeable with notice of the facts shown by the records, and could not shut her eyes to these sources of information and still be an innocent purchaser without notice. This doctrine, often asserted in this court, was summarized in Ochoa v. Hernandez, \n230 \nU.S. 139, 164\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 1033, 1042 (57 L. Ed. 1427) in which it was said:\n'It is a familiar doctrine, universally recognized where laws are in force for the registry or recording of instruments of conveyance, that every purchaser takes his title subject to any defects and infirmities that may be ascertained by reference to his chain of title as spread forth upon the public records. Brush v. Ware, 15 Pet. 93, 111 [10 L. Ed. 672]; Simmons Creek Coal Co. v. Doran, \n142 U.S. 417\n, 437 [12 Sup. Ct. 239]; Northwestern Bank v. Freeman, \n171 U.S. 620\n, 629 [19 Sup. Ct. 36]; Mitchell v. D'Olier, 68 N. J. Law (39 Vr.) 375, 384, 53 Atl. 467, 59 L. R. A. 949.'\n\n If Mrs. Krueger had used these sources of information she would have ascertained that the Moses affidavit wherein it was stated that the lands were not in any manner occupied adversely was untrue, constructively she is held to have knowledge of these facts. Washington Securities Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 76, 79\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 725. And see Dellemand v. Mannon, 4 Colo. App. 262, 264, 35 Pac. 679. The defense of bona fide purchaser is an affirmative one, and the burden was upon Mrs. Krueger to establish it in order to defeat the right of the government to have a cancellation of the patent, fraudulently obtained. Wright-Blodgett \n\n[246 U.S. 69, 79]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 397, 403\n, 404 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 339; Great Northern Railway Co. v. Hower, \n236 U.S. 702\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 465.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that Mrs. Krueger did not sust in the burden of showing that she was a bona fide purchaser for value, and under the circumstances shown she had constructive notice of the manner in which the land had been procured from the United States. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not err in holding that the government was entitled to a cancellation of the patent.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 5.

The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to withdraw from the Treasury of the United States, at his discretion, the sum of $205,000, or so much thereof as may be necessary, of the principal sum on deposit to the credit of the Chippewa Indians in the state of Minnesota, arising under section seven of the Act of January fourteenth, eighteen hundred and eighty-nine, entitled 'An act for the relief and civilization of the Chippewa Indians in the state of Minnesota,' and to use the same for the purpose of promoting civilization and self-support among the said Indians in manner and for purposes provided for in said act,' provided [not more than $45, 000 of this amount may be used for purchase of lands and removal of bodies of certain deceased Indians].\n\n The annual appropriation bill for current and contingent expenses of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, etc., for fiscal year ending June 30, 1916, failed of passage and in lieu of it Congress passed the Joint Resolution approved March 4, 1915, which follows:\n'Joint Resolution making appropriations for current and contingent expenses of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, for fulfilling treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes, and for other purposes, for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and sixteen.\n\n'Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that all appropriations for the current and contingent expenses of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and for fulfilling treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes, which shall remain unprovided for on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and fifteen, are continued and made available for and during the fiscal year nineteen hundred and sixteen \n\n[246 U.S. 214, 217]\n\u00a0\n to the same extent, in detail, and under the same conditions, restrictions, and limitations for the fiscal year nineteen hundred and sixteen as the same were provided for on account of the fiscal year nineteen hundred and fifteen in the Indian Appropriation Act for that fiscal year. For all of such purposes a sufficient sum is appropriated, out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, or out of funds to the credit of Indians as the same were respectively provided in the Indian Appropriation Act for the fiscal year nineteen hundred and fifteen: Provided, that the appropriations from the treasury of the United States or from Indian funds shall not exceed in the aggregate the amounts of such appropriations for the fiscal year nineteen hundred and fifteen: Provided further, that this joint resolution shall not be const ued as providing for or authorizing the duplication of any special payment or for the execution of any purpose provided for in said Appropriation Act that was intended to be paid only once or done solely on account of the fiscal year nineteen hundred and fifteen . ...' 38 Stat. 1228\n\n\n\n The original bill alleged that no part of the $205,000 appropriated by Act of August 1, 1914, was for expenses of the Bureau of Indian Affairs or for fulfilling treaty stipulations with Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, but all (except the $40,000 item not here involved) was for special payments and limited to fiscal year ending June 30, 1915; that it was not intended as a regular annual appropriation and the Joint Resolution of 1915 in express language excluded such items in Act of 1914 from being re- expended during 1916; that notwithstanding this the Comptroller of the Treasury had ruled the Joint Resolution did reappropriate $160,000, and the Secretary of the Interior and Commissioner of Indian Affairs were preparing to expend such sum out of Indians' trust funds; and that unless enjoined they would draw warrants therefor upon the treasury which would be honored. \n\n[246 U.S. 214, 218]\n\u00a0\n Upon motion, the trial court dismissed the bill for want of equity. The Court of Appeals reversed the decree, holding the Joint Resolution did not reappropriate $160,000 and the relief prayed should have been granted. Treating this as final and conclusive of issues involved the cause was brought here by appeal.\n The only point presented for decision is whether by the language used Congress has sufficiently indicated an intent to appropriate the money in question. The bill does not challenge its power.\n Under an act approved January 14, 1889 (25 Stat. 642, c. 24), lands in Minnesota occupied by Chippewa Indians were disposed of and proceeds deposited to their credit in the United States treasury, it being agreed that the fund should bear 5 per cent. interest to be paid directly to the Indians or used for their schools, and further 'that Congress may, in its discretion, from time to time, during the said period of fifty years, appropriate, for the purpose of promoting civilization and self-support among the said Indians, a portion of said principal sum, not exceeding five per centum thereof.' For many years subsequent to 1889, under the general head of 'Current and contingent expenses of the Indian Department ... and fulfilling treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes,' appropriations were made for general benefit of Chippewas 'to be reimbursed to the United States out of the proceeds of sales of their lands.' In 1911 their funds derived from land sales had become very large; and beginning then and continuing down to 1914 the annual Indian appropriations bill contained an item essentially similar (except as to amounts) both in words and position to the one in section 8, Act of 1914 quoted above.\n It seems clear that 'civilization and self-support' among the Indians cannot be promoted effectively by disconnected efforts, but must be accomplished, if at all, by definite, permanent plans operating through many years. \n\n[246 U.S. 214, 219]\n\u00a0\n And in view of the long-continued practice of Congress to provide funds for such continuous efforts by annual appropriations, the circumstances under which the Joint Resolution became law, and the studied incorporation therein of the language of former appropriation acts, we think the purpose was to authorize expenditure of $160,000 during 1916, as had been done for 1915. A different construction might have occasioned disruption of well ordered arrangements for advancing the nation's wards, to the great detriment of all concerned; and to such unfortunate consequences experienced legislators probably were not oblivious.\n By construing the resolution too narrowly the court below reached an erroneous conclusion. Its decree is therefore reversed; and the decree of the Supreme Court, District of Columbia, is affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA dissents. \n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAY v.

But the assumption indulged in as to the effect of the law of the United States is without merit. McGowan v. Parish, \n237 \nU.S. 285, 294\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 543, and cases cited. This renders it unnecessary to consider whether, if the heirs at law were entitled to the fund, they would be liable to pay the full sum of the attorney's fee contracted for by the transferee and the duty to pay which the transferee and those in privity do not dispute.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOCOMOBILE CO.

Harold Hitchcock, of Boston, Mass., for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An excise tax of $1,300 imposed on a West Virginia corporation for doing a local business in Massachusetts during the year 1915 is here in question. The state court sustained it. 228 Mass. 117, 117 N. E. 5. The corporation is engaged in manufacturing in Connecticut and sells its manufactured articles extensively in interstate commerce. It does both an interstate and a local business in Massachusetts. Each is of considerable volume, but the inter- \n\n[246 U.S. 146, 147]\n\u00a0\n state is much the larger, although this is not material. The tax is of a designated per cent. of the entire authorized capital, and was imposed after the maximum limit named in St. 1909, c. 490, part 3,  56, was removed by St. 1914, c. 724,  1.

Terry, of Galveston, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents for decision a motion by appellees to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction, and it involves the consideration of the latest chapter in a litigation which was commenced in 1911, when the Railroad Commission o Louisiana filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission a complaint charging various railroad companies with maintaining unreasonable rates on traffic from Shreveport, Louisiana, to points in Texas, and with maintaining rates which unjustly discriminated in favor of traffic moving wholly within the state of Texas as against that between Louisiana and Texas.\n A hearing resulted in an order by the Commission, which was assailed by the railroad companies as invalid, but which this court sustained in Houston, East & West Texas Ry. Co. v. United States, \n234 U.S. 342\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 833. 58 L. Ed. 1341, in a decision rendered in 1913, which has come to be widely referred to as the 'Shreveport case.'\n After this decision there were further proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission, hwich resulted, on July 7, 1916, in the order out of which this litigation arose, which required many railroad companies, among other things,\n'To establish, on or before November 1, 1916, ... and thereafter to maintain and apply to transportation of property between Shreveport, Louisiana, and points in the State of Texas, class rates and rates on the above named (in the order) commodities not in excess of those contemporaneously applied by them for the transportation of like property for like distances between points in the State of Texas, except in those instances where the rates between Texas points have been depressed \n\n[247 U.S. 214, 216]\n\u00a0\n by reason of water competition along the Gulf of Mexico, or waters contiguous thereto.'\n\n Immediately after this order was entered the Attorney General of Texas declared that it was void and that he would institute suits under the Texas laws for damages and penalties against any carrier which should comply with it. Thereupon the carriers filed a bill in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, in which they averred the validity of the order, the necessity for their obeying it, their intention to obey it, the threat of suits by the Attorney General, and, attaching a copy of the tariff they had compiled to comply with the order ( designated as Texas Lines Tariff 2-B), they prayed for an injunction restraining the Attorney General from executing the threat which he had made. A temporary restraining order was granted and on November 1, 1916, the tariffs were duly filed.\n Issue was joined on this bill, and elaborate pleadings were filed by both parties, such that there can be no doubt that the Attorney General challenged the validity of the order as arbitrary, unreasonable, unsupported by the evidence and void, and especially as being inapplicable, in the terms and for want of power, to the western part of Texas, which, for rate-making purposes, is designated 'differential territory.'\n An application for a temporary injunction, on the issues thus joined, was heard on April 4, 1917, by three judges, and resulted in an order as prayed for. The court, in arriving at its announced conclusion, expressly disclaimed passing on the merits of the controversy, and granted the injunction because, as is variously stated in the opinions rendered, it deemed it necessary to prevent a multiplicity of destructive suits against the carriers; because the order of the Commission could not be held void on a preliminary hearing; and because the Texas rate situation involved was at the time in process of re- \n\n[247 U.S. 214, 217]\n\u00a0\n -examination by the Interstate Commerce Commission. No appeal was taken from this order.\n Between the time of the filing of the bill for the injunction and the hearing on April 4th, the Interstate Commerce Commission had entered two orders in the proceeding in which the order of July 7, 1916, had been granted, one that the tariff filed by the carriers on November 1st, Texas Lines Tariff 2-B, slightly modified, should be permitted to remain effective until further order; and another reopening the proceeding to give to the Texas authorities an opportunity to introduce new and material evidence, which they asserted should lead to a modifica ion or vacating of the order and might bring about a just and reasonable settlement of the controversy.\n Immediately after the granting of the preliminary injunction the taking of testimony in the reopened inquiry was commenced by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Attorney, General participating, and went forward until in May, when it was continued to the following October for the filing of briefs and for oral argument.\n And now, notwithstanding the temporary injunction and notwithstanding the pendency of the re-opened hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Attorney General on July 20th, instituted suit in a Texas state court, in which he prayed for an injunction restraining the carriers from giving the effect which they had been giving to the Texas Lines Tariff 2-B, since November 1st of the preceding year, as applied to intrastate traffic moving less than 351 miles within, to and from 'differential territory' in Texas. Before the date set for this application by the Attorney General for an injunction, the carriers filed a second supplemental bill in their suit in the United States court, detailing the facts with respect to the various proceedings and hearings which had been had therein, and with respect to the \n\n[247 U.S. 214, 218]\n\u00a0\n injunction, not appealed from, granted in the preceding April, and prayed that the Attorney General be enjoined from prosecuting the suit commenced by him in the state court or any other suit of like character, for the reason, among others, that:\n'It is necessary to protect the jurisdiction of this court already acquired over the subject-matter and in order to afford these plaintiffs [the carriers] full and complete relief.'\n\n The Attorney General answered this bill, denying that the rates complained of in the state court were warranted by the order of July 7, 1916, or by the proper construction of the Texas Lines Tariff 2-B and then went forward and again assailed the validity of the order of July 7, 1916, on substantially the same grounds stated in answers filed by him in the case prior to the granting of the injunction in the preceding April, and he prayed that the order be declared to be null and void, in whole or in part.\n On this supplemental bill an injunction was granted, to continue until final hearing or until further order of the court, enjoining the Attorney General and his assistants from prosecuting the suit thus commenced by him in the Texas court, and from instituting or prosecuting any similiar suits in any court other than the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas and from in any way interfering with the carriers in charging the rates published in Texas Lines Tariff 2- B and supplements thereto.\n From this temporary injunction the Attorney General appeals to this court, and the case has been heard on the motion of the appellees to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction. One ground, among others, urged for sustaining this motion is that the federal District Court having acquired, and having entered upon the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties to and the subjectmatter of the suit in that court, prior to the commencement of \n\n[247 U.S. 214, 219]\n\u00a0\n the suit in the state court, the injunction issued against the Attorney General was granted in aid of and was necessary to protect that jurisdiction until a conclusion should be reached completely disposing of the case and controversy, and is therefore not an appealable order within section 266 of the Judicial Code.\n The theory upon which the Attorney General seeks to sustain his appeal is, that the injunction of September 22d is one restraining him in his capacity as a state officer from enforcing statutes of the state of Texas and orders by the Railroad Commission of that state entered pursuant thereto, on the ground that the statutes are unconstitutional and that the orders are unlawful, and therefore, it is claimed, an appeal direct to this court is warranted under section 266 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1162 [Comp. St. 1916,  1243]).\n With this contention of the Attorney General we cannot agree. There is no claim in the second supplemental bill, on which this injunction was granted, that any state statute is unconstitutional or that the execution of any order of the Railroad Commission of Texas should be suspended because invalid. The bill is very voluminous, but as we interpret its allegations it simply sets out in detail the history of the suit in which it was filed, for the purpose of showing: That by the pleadings of the parties-by those of the carriers not more than by those of the Attorney General-every phase of the controversy, and definitely the aspect of it involved in the petition filed in the state court by the Attorney General on July 20, 1917, had been submitted to and was considered by the court when the application for a temporary injunction was heard in the preceding April, and also what the facts were with respect to the re-opened inquiry before the Interstate Commerce Commission, so that it should appear to the court that the Texas rate situation, again involving the phase of it presented by the Attorney General in the state suit, was pending, undisposed of before the Commis- \n\n[247 U.S. 214, 220]\n\u00a0\n sion when his petition was filed. The specific ground of the prayer for the injunction is:\n'Because the state court is without jurisdiction of the subject- matter and because it is necessary to protect the jurisdiction of this court already acquired over the subject-matter and in order to afford these plaintiffs the full and complete relief contemplated by the opinions of the circuit judges and in the order made by them granting the injunction herein.'\n\n The opinion of the court in granting the injunction appealed form is a satisfactory and sufficient statement of what this record discloses had been done in the case prior to the application for the injunction and amply justifies the granting of it. This statement is as follows:\n'The subject-matter of the state suit is a part of that involved in this case. The jurisdiction of this court with reference thereto has been invoked by the parties plaintiff and defendant and by interveners; the jurisdiction has been exercised by this court in granting an injunction at the prayer of plaintiffs, and refusing one asked by defendants, and by considering and determining an application for a continuance. ... Jurisdiction having been conferred by law, having been invoked by all the parties, and having been exercised by the court, its protection is a right and duty not limited by section 266, Judicial Code. The injunction prayed for by complainants is granted. ...\n\n'... But, waiving all questions as to the legality or propriety of modifying their action (that of the judges in April preceding), our conclusion is that the present status should be maintained until such time as this court may consider all of the grave questions of law and all the great mass of facts connected with this complicated and important litigation. The fact that the matters involved are again before the Interstate Commerce Commission, and that their action may affect the rates attacked, fur- \n\n[247 U.S. 214, 221]\n\u00a0\n nishes an additional reason for our conclusion. The relief asked by defendants is refused.'\n\n The use of the writ of injunction, by federal courts first acquiring jurisdiction ovre the parties or the subject-matter of a suit, for the purpose of protecting and preserving that jurisdiction until the object of the suit is accomplished and complete justice done between the parties is familiar and long established practice, Freeman v. Howe, 24 How. 450; Harkrader v. Wadley, \n172 \nU.S. 148, 163\n, 164 S., 19 Sup. Ct. 119, in a rate case, Missouri v. Chi., Bur. & Quincy R. R. Co., \n241 \nU.S. 533, 543\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 715. So important is it that unseemly conflict of authority between state and federal courts should be avoided by maintaining the jurisdiction of each free from the encroachments of the other, that section 265 of the Judicial Code, Revis d Statutes, section 720, Act of March 2, 1793, c. 22, 1 Stat. L. 334 (Comp. St. 1916,  1242), has repeatedly been held not applicable to such an injunction. Julian v. Central Trust Co., \n193 \nU.S. 93, 113\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 399; Simon v. Southern Ry.

Colston, of Louisville, Ky., for appellant.\n Mr. Asst. Atty. Gen. Frierson, for the United States.\n Mr. Joseph W. Folk, of Washington, D. C., for the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Bowling Green, Kentucky, is located on the main line of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, 114 miles south of Louisville and 73 miles north of Nashville. Prior to the year 1910 the railroad had established many rates to and from Bowling Green which were higher than those charged by it for longer distances over the same route in the same direction to and from Louisville and Nashville. The amendment to section 4, of the Act to Regulate Commerce, made June 18, 1910 (c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 547), prohibits any such higher charges for shorter distances unless previously authorized by the Interstate Commerce \n\n[245 U.S. 463, 465]\n\u00a0\n Commission; but it provided that carriers might, within six months thereafter, apply to the Commission for authority to continue in effect charges of that nature then lawfully existing. Within the period so fixed the railroad filed such an application covering many hundred different places scattered over its extended system, and including both Louisville and Nashville. That part of the application which sought to continue in effect lower rates to and from Louisville and Nashville than those in effect to and from Bowling Green, was heard separately. \n1\n The railroad sought to justify the lower charges for the longer distances by showing that it had to meet, particularly as to Nashville traffic, competition both by water and by rail. This contention was opposed by evidence to the effect that at Bowling Green, also, there was water competition, actual or potential and that at Nashville there was no real rail competition. After full hearing an order was entered which (after several revisions) merely denied to the railroad authority to continue on certain traffic through Bowling Green to Louisville and to Nashville lower rates 'than are contemporaneously in effect to Bowling Green.' Bowling Green Business Men's Association v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co., 24 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 228.\n The railroad then brought this suit in the Commerce Court to set aside the order of the Commission and asked for a temporary injunction. \n2\n Upon the abolition of that \n\n[245 U.S. 463, 466]\n\u00a0\n court by Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, the case was heard in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Kentucky before three judges. The railroad assailed the validity of the order on many grounds; but its main contentions were, that the order complained of was not such a negative order as was contemplated by the fourth section of the Act to Regulate Commerce, was not responsive to the application and hence, was not such an order as the Commission had power to make; and also that its decision was 'contrary to the indisputable nature of the evidence' and not supported by any evidence. The District Court refused to grant a temporary injunction and dismissed the bill. 225 Fed. 571.\n The case comes here by direct appeal; and thirty-eight error are assigned. Eleven relate to the weight or sufficiency of the evidence before the Commission. The evidence was conflicting. And, as there was ample to sustain the findings, they are conclusive. United States v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad, \n235 \nU.S. 314, 320\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 113. Other assignments present, in substance, either criticism of the reasoning of the Commission or of the form of the order, or assert unsubstantial or unsubstantiated irregularities in practice before the Commission; such as that the order deprived plaintiff of its property without due process of law, because the 'order was broader than the hearing held in connection therewith,' or that it was invalid because the Commission failed to act on 'other phases' of the application. United States v. Merchants' & Manufacturers' Traffic Association, \n242 U.S. 178\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 24. Other errors assigned relate to the exclusion by the court of evidence which was clearly inadmissible, both because of the character of the evidence and because, on the issues presented, the validity of the order must be determined upon the evidence introduced before the Commission. Still other assignments allege, in varying language but without \n\n[245 U.S. 463, 467]\n\u00a0\n statement of reasons, that the Commission was without power to enter the order or that the court erred in denying the relief prayed for.

Clay & Clay, of Henderson, Ky., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the court.\n Holloway, a locomotive engineer, was killed on the Louisville & Nashville Railroad while engaged in the performance of his duties. His administrator brought, for the benefit of his widow, an action under the federal Employers' Liability Act in a state court of Kentucky and recovered a verdict of $32,900. The judgment entered thereon was reversed by the Court of Appeals (163 Ky. 125, 173 S. W. 343); and, at the second trial, a verdict was rendered for $25,000. Judgment was entered on this verdict, and was affirmed with ten per cent. amage by the Court of Appeals (168 Ky. 262, 181 S. W. 1126. The case comes here under section 237 of the Judicial Code. The errors assigned in this court and now insisted upon are these:\n The first assignment: That the Court of Appeals erred in approving the giving of an instruction and the refusal of another1 by which the trial judge had denied to the \n\n[246 U.S. 525, 527]\n\u00a0\n company the benefit of the rule declared in Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. Kelly, \n241 \nU.S. 485, 491\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 630, L. R. A. 1917F, 367, that in computing damages recoverable for the deprivation of future financial benefits, the verdict should be based on their present value.\n The third assignment: That the Court of Appeals erred in refusing to reverse the judgment of the trial court on the ground that the damages were excessive, and in holding as part of the loss of benefits the widow might have received and which the jury was entitled to consider 'not only her support and maintenance of $50.00 a month, but in addition thereto, one-half of the savings, which decedent might have accumulated if he had lived out his allotted span' of life.\n First. The instruction given, though general, was correct. It declared that the plaintiff was entitled to recover 'such an amount in damages as will fairly and reasonably compensate' the widow 'for the loss of pecuniary benefits she might reasonably have received' but for her husband's death. This ruling did not imply that the verdict should be for the aggregate of the several benefits payable at \n\n[246 U.S. 525, 528]\n\u00a0\n different times, without making any allowance for the fact that the whole amount of the verdict would be presently paid at one time. The instruction bore rather an implication to the contrary; for the sum was expressly stated to be that which would 'compensate.' The language used was similar to that in which this court has since expressed, in Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. Kelly, supra, \n241 U.S. 489\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 630, L. R. A. 1917F, 367, the measure of damages which should be applied2. The company had, of course, the right to require that this general instruction be supplemented by another calling attention to the fact that, in estimating what amount would compensate the widow, future benefits must be considered at their present value. But it did not ask for any such instruction. Instead it erroneously sought to subject the jury's estimate to two rigid mathematical limitations: (1) That money would be worth to the widow six per cent., the legal rate of interest; (2) that the period during which the future benefits would have continued was 28.62 years-the life expectancy of the husband according to one of several well known actuarial tables. The company was not entitled to have the jury instructed as matter of law either that money was worth that rate, or that the deceased would not in any event have outlived his probable expectancy. See Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. Kelly, supra, \n241 U.S. 490\n-492, 36 Sup. Ct. 630, L. R. A. 1917F, 367. Nor need we determine whether the local rule of practice, that if instructions are offered upon any issue respecting which the jury should be instructed and they are incorrect in form or substance it is the duty of the trial court to prepare or direct the preparation of a proper instruction upon the point in place of the defective one (see Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. De Atley, \n241 \nU.S. 310, 316\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 564), was applicable in the case at bar. That is a question of state law, with which we have no concern. \n\n[246 U.S. 525, 529]\n\u00a0\n In the De Atley Case, the Kentucky Court of Appeals assumed for the purposes of its decision that the local rule applied, and was thereby led to decide a question of federal law. Consequently we had and exercised jurisdiction to review its decision upon that question.\n Second. The third assignment, in so far as it relates to the refusal of the Court of Appeals to reverse the judgment 'on the ground that the damages are excessive,' is not reviewable he e. Southern Railway Co. v. Bennett, \n233 \nU.S. 80, 86\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 566. It does not appear in the case at bar, as it did in Chesapeake & Ohio Ry, v. Gainey, \n241 \nU.S. 494, 496\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 633, that the action of the Court of Appeals in sustaining the verdict was necessarily based upon an erroneous theory of federal law. As to the alleged error of the Court of Appeals in holding as part of the benefit the widow might have received 'not only her support and maintenance of $50.00 a month, but in addition thereto, one-half of the savings, which decedent might have accumulated,' it is a sufficient answer that the trial court did not give any instruction on that subject, nor was it requested to give any, and that the Court of Appeals did not hold as stated that the widow could share in the loss to the estate. It held that the pecuniary benefit which the jury was entitled to consider in estimating the widow's damages was not merely what she would have spent for maintenance and support, but what she would otherwise have received from her husband.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The instruction given was: 'The measure of recovery if you find for the plaintiff, being such an amount in damages as will fairly and reasonably compensate the widow of the said John G. Holloway, deceased, for the loss of pecuniary benefits she might reasonably have received if the deceased had not been killed, not exceeding the amount claimed; to wit : $50,000.00.'\n The instruction refused was: 'The court instructs the jury that if they shall find for the plaintiff, their verdict cannot, in any event, exceed a sum which will yield, at interest at 6 per cent., a sum which will represent the proven pecuniary benefits which Mrs. Holloway received from her husband in his lifetime, and had reasonable expectation of receiving from him if he had not been killed. And the court further instructs the jury that the amount so awarded by them should be diminished by such amount as that, by using the interest and a part of the principal sum each year, the principal sum will have been exhausted at the expiration of decedent's expectancy of 28.62 years.'\n No other instruction on the measure of damages was given; and none was requested except an instruction, not now insisted upon, limiting the recovery specifically to $13,737.60. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'The damages should be equivalent to compensation for the deprivation of the reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefits that would have resulted from the continued life of the deceased.' \n\n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N.

Stone, of Louisville, Ky., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. T. M. Miller, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Did the District Court rightly decide that it had no jurisdiction, is the only question presented.\n Plaintiff in error sued to recover one hundred and forty-five dollars claimed to be due under tariffs approved and published as required by Interstate Commerce Act, for disinfecting fifty-eight cars containing live stock shipped \n\n[247 U.S. 201, 202]\n\u00a0\n from points outside the state and delivered to defendant, the consignee, at New Orleans, Louisiana. It alleged presentation of bills covering each shipment and payment by defendant of all charges except those for disinfecting-tow dollars and fifty cents per car.\n Answering, defendant admitted the shipments were interstate; that he paid all lawful charges, except those sued for; and that these had been properly prescribed under and pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act. But he denied liability for these reasons: as the carrier well knew, or should have known, he had long been engaged in the business of factor or commission merchant; in due course while acting as representative for their owners and consignors he received the live stock, sold them immediately upon arrival, deducted expenses, etc., and remitted balance of proceeds to his principals; when the cars arrived he paid all charges actually demanded; he was not then advised and remained unaware that any others were contemplated until such balance had been remitted. Having led him to believe the amount asked and paid before he remitted entire net proceeds constituted full settlement, the carrier is now estopped from demanding more of him.\n The trial court upon its own initiative dismissed the action for want of jurisdiction.\n Section 24 of the Judicial Code provides that regardless of amount involved District Courts shall have original jurisdiction 'of all suits and proceedings arising under any law regulating commerce.' The Interstate Commerce Act requires carrier to collect and consignee to pay all lawful charges duly prescribed by the tariff in respect of every shipment. Their duty and obligation grow out of and depend upon that act.\n In support of the trial court it is said: There is no jurisdiction unless the suit in part at least arises out of a controversy in regard to operation or effect of the act of Congress. Here there is no dispute as to legality of rate \n\n[247 U.S. 201, 203]\n\u00a0\n or its application to the shipments; and consignee's liability was fully discharged upon payment by him of amount demanded at time of delivery and surrender of the carrier's lien.\n'Cases arising under the laws of the United States are such as grow out of the legislation of Congress.'

MCCAHAN SUGAR REFINING CO.(1918)\nNo. 51\nArgued: November 18, 1918Decided: December 9, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 139, 140]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Peter S. Carter, Charles C. Burlingham, and Roscoe H. Hupper, all of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 139, 143]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Parker Kirlin, of New York City, for respondent Insular Line.\n Mr. Lawrence Kneeland, of New York City, for respondent W. J. McCahan Sugar Refining Co. \n\n[248 U.S. 139, 144]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The W. J. McCahan Sugar Refining Company shipped a cargo of sugar from Porto Rico to Philadelphia by the Julia Luckenbach which was under charter to the Insular Line, and the cargo suffered severe damage. In the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, a libel seeking damages was filed in the name of the shipper in personam against the Insular Line and in rem against the steamer. It alleged that the damages resulted from unseaworthiness of the hull, existing at the commencement of the voyage. The petitioners, owners of the ship, were impleaded. The bills of lading sued on contained a clause relieving the carrier from liability for damages arising from--\n'any latent defect in hull. ... or by unseaworthiness of the ship, even existing at the time of shipment or sailing on the voyage, but not discoverable by the exercise of due diligence by the ship owner or manager. ...'\n\n The libel alleged that the unseaworthiness would have been discovered, had due diligence been exercised. The District Court so found and held that the libelant was entitled to recover. The damages were agreed to be $ 87,526.65, with interest, and the value of the ship and pending freight was found or agreed to be $66,600. The owners duly moved for limitation of liability. The District Court found that the damages sustained were occasioned without the privity or knowledge of the owners; held that they were entitled to limit their liability, both as against the shipper and as against the charterer, who claimed indemnity; and ordered that the owners should pay the shipper's claim to the extent of the value of the \n\n[248 U.S. 139, 145]\n\u00a0\n ship and pending freight, and that the balance should be paid by the Insular Line. 235 Fed. 388, 148 C. C. A. 650. Both the owners and the Insular Line appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court modified the decree, so as to award that payment of the full amount be made to the shipper primarily by the steamer and the owners, and that the charterer should be called upon to make payment only of the deficiency, if any. 235 Fed. 388, 148 C. C. A. 650. The case comes here on writ of certiorari granted on the petition of the owners. \n242 U.S. 638\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 111.\n It is urged, on three grounds, that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed and that the District Court should be directed, either to dismiss the libel or to limit the owners' liability to the value of the ship and pending freight.\n First. The owners contend that both lower courts erred in holding that the steamer was unseaworthy at the commencement of her voyage and that due diligence to make her seaworthy had not been exercised. The issue involved is one of fact; and no reason appears why the general rule should not apply, that concurrent decisions of the two lower courts on an issue of fact will be accepted by this court unless shown to be clearly erroneous. The Wildcroft, \n201 \nU.S. 378, 387\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 467; The Carib Prince, \n170 \nU.S. 655, 658\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 753\n\n\n Second. The owners (and also the charterer) contend that the libel should be dismissed, because the shipper had already been compensated for the loss by insurance which it effected; and that the carrier is entitled to the full benefit of this insurance.\n The shipper had effected full insurance. The bills of lading sued on contain the following clause:\n'In case of any loss, detriment or damage done to or sustained by said goods or any part thereof for which the carrier shall be liable to the shipper, owner or consignee, the carrier shall to the extent of such liability have the \n\n[248 U.S. 139, 146]\n\u00a0\n full benefit of any insurance that may have been effected upon or on account of said goods.'\n\n Such a clause is valid, because the carrier might himself have insured against the loss, even though occasioned by his own negligence; and if a shipper under a bill of lading containing this provision effects insurance and is paid the full amount of his loss, neither he nor the insurer can recover against the carrier. Phoenix Insurance Co. v. Erie & Western Transportation Co., \n117 U.S. 312\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 750; Wager v. Providence Insurance Co., \n150 U.S. 99\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 55. In the case at bar, the shipper has received from the insurance companies an amount equal to the loss; but it is contended that the money was received as a loan or conditional payment merely, and that, therefore, the carrier is not relieved from liability. The essential facts are these:\n The policies under which the shipper was insured contained the following, or a similar, provision:\n'Warranted by the assured free from any liability for merchandise in the possession of any carrier or other bailee, who may be liable for any loss or damage thereto; and for merchandise shipped under a bill of lading containing a stipulation that the carrier may have the benefit of any insurance thereon.'\n\n The situation was, therefore, this: The carrier (including in this term the charterer, the ship, and the owners) would, in no event be liable to the shipper for the damages occasioned by unseaworthiness, unless guilty of negligence. The insurer would, in no event, be liable to the shipper, if the carrier was liable. In case the insurer should refuse to pay until the shipper had established that recovery against the carrier was not possible-prompt settlement for loss (which is essential to actual indemnity and demanded in the interest of commerce) would be defeated. If, on the other hand, the insurers should settle the loss, before the question of the carrier's \n\n[248 U.S. 139, 147]\n\u00a0\n liability for loss had been determined, the insurer would lose the benefit of all claims against the carrier, to which it would be subrogated in the absence of a provision to the contrary in the bill of lading (The Potomac, \n105 U.S. 630\n, 634), and the carrier would be freed from liability to any one. In order that the shipper should not be deprived of the use of money which it was entitled to receive promptly after the loss, either from the carrier or from the insurers, and that the insurer should not lose the right of subrogation, agreements in the following (or similar) form were entered into between the insurers and the shipper:\n'New York, Aug. 15, 1912.\n\n'Received from the Federal Insurance Company. twenty-three hundred four and 16\/100 dollars, as a loan and repayable only to the extent of any net recovery we may make from any carrier, bailee or others on account of loss to our property (described below) due to damage on S\/S Julia Luckenbach from Porto Rico\/Philadelphia, Philadelphia, on or about _____ _____, 19__, or from any insurance effected by any carrier, bailee or others on said property, and as security for such repayment we hereby pledge to the said Federal Insurance Company, the said recovery and deliver to them duly endorsed the bills of lading for said property and we agree to enter and prosecute suit against said railroad, carrier, bailee, or others on said claim with all due diligence at the expense and under the exclusive direction and control of the said Federal Insurance Company.\n\n'The W. J. McCahan Sugar Refining Co.,\n\n'$2.304.16\n\n R. S. Pomeroy, Treasurer.\n'Description of property: Sugar.'\n\n Upon delivery of this and similar agreements, the shipper received from the insurance companies, promptly after the adjustment of the loss, amounts aggregating \n\n[248 U.S. 139, 148]\n\u00a0\n the loss; and this libel was filed in the name of the shipper, but for the sole benefit of the insurers, through their proctors and counsel, and wholly at their expense. If, and to the extent (less expenses) that, recovery is had, the insurers will receive payment or be reimbursed for their so-called loans to the shipper. If nothing is recovered from the carrier, the shipper will retain the money received by it without being under obligation to make any repayment of the amounts advanced. In other words, if there is no recovery here, the amounts advanced will operate as absolute payment under the policies.\n Agreements of this nature have been a common practice in business for many years. Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Burr, 130 Fed. 847, 65 C. C. A. 331; Bradley v. Lehigh Valley Railroad Co., 153 Fed. 350, 82 C. C. A. 426. It is clear that if valid and enforced according to their terms, they accomplish the desired purpose. They supply the shipper promptly with money to the full extent of the indemnity or compensation to which he is entitled on account of the loss; and they preserve to the insurers the claim against the carrier to which by the general law of insurance, independently of special agreement, they would become subrogated upon payment by them of the loss. The carrier insists that the transaction, while in terms a loan, is in substance a payment of insurance; that to treat it as if it were a loan, is to follow the letter of the agreement and to disregard the actual facts; and that to give it effect as a loan is to sanction fiction and subterfuge. But no good reason appears either for questioning its legality or for denying its effect. The shipper is under no obligation to the carrier to take out insurance on the cargo; and the freight rate is the same whether he does or does not insure. The general law does not give the carrier, upon payment of the shipper's claim, a right by subrogation against the insurers. The insurer has, on the other hand, by the general law, a right of subrogation against the carrier. Such claims, like tangible \n\n[248 U.S. 139, 149]\n\u00a0\n salvage, are elements which enter into the calculations of actuaries in fixing insurance rates; and, at least in the mutual companies, the insured gets some benefit from amounts realized therefrom. It is essential to the performance of the insurer's service, that the insured be promptly put in funds, so that his business may be continued without embarrassment. Unless this is provided for, credits which are commonly issued against drafts or notes with bills of lading attached, would not be granted. Whether the transfer of money or other thing shall operate as a payment, is ordinarily a matter which is determined by the intention of the parties to the transaction. Compare The Kimball, 3 Wall. 37, 44. The insurer could not have been obliged to pay until the condition of their liability-i. e., nonliability of the carrier-had been established. The shipper could not have been obliged to surrender to the insurers the conduct of the litigation against the carrier, until the insurers had paid. In consideration of securing then the right to conduct the litigation, the insurers made the advances. It is creditable to the ingenuity of business men that an arrangement should have been devised which is consonant both with the needs of commerce and the demands of justice.\n Third. The owners contend that, under section 4283 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. 1916,  8021) and section 18 of the Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121 (23 Stat. 57 [Comp. St. 1916,  8028]), their liability should have been limited to the value of the ship and her pending freight; because the District Court found that her unseaworthiness was without their privity or knowledge; and this finding was not disturbed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. But the liability of the owners sought to be enforced here is one resting upon their personal contract; and to such liabilities the limitations acts do not apply. Pendleton v. Benner Line, \n246 U.S. 353\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 330.\n It is also urged that, as between the owners and the Insular Line, the original warranty of seaworthiness was \n\n[248 U.S. 139, 150]\n\u00a0\n exhausted upon delivery of the ship to the charterers and that the maintenance clause relied upon does not import a warranty of seaworthiness at the commencement of each voyage under a time charter, but merely an obligation to pay the expense of keeping her hull and machinery in repair throughout the service. Neither the language of the clause nor the character of time charters afford support for this contention. The charter of the vessel states clearly that, the vessel 'being, on her delivery, tight, staunch [and] strong,' the owners will 'maintain her in a thoroughly efficient state in hull and machinery for and during the service'-not pay the expense of maintaining her. This duty to maintain the vessel in an efficient state is imposed by the contract, because a time charter, like a charter for a single voyage, is not a demise of the ship. In both, the charterer is without control over her repair and maintenance. In operations under each the charterer becomes liable to shippers without limitation for losses due to unseaworthiness discoverable by the exercise of due dilligence on the part of the owners; and in each case he requires for his protection a warranty, without limitation, of seaworthiness at the commencement of every voyage. Compare The Burma, 187 Fed. 94, 110 C. C. A. 330; Whipple v. Mississippi & Yazoo Packet Co. (D. C.) 34 Fed. 54; McIver & Co., Ltd., v. Tate Steamers, Ltd., \n\n[248 U.S. 139, 1903]\n\u00a0\n 1 K. B. 362; Park v. Duncan & Sons, 35 Scottish Law Reporter, 378. If Giertsen v. Turnbull & Co., 45 Scottish Law Reporter, 916, strongly relied upon by the owners, is inconsistent with this view, it should be disregarded.\n Fourth. The vessel was owned 54\/80ths by Edgar F. Luckenbach, as sole trustee of the estate of Lewis Luckenbach; 10\/80 ths by Edgar F. Luckenbach individually; and 16\/80 ths by John W. Weber and Hattie W. Luckenbach, executors of the estate of Edward Luckenbach. All of these parties were impleaded as owners. The charter party was signed only by 'Estate of Lewis Luckenbach, \n\n[248 U.S. 139, 151]\n\u00a0\n per Edgar F. Luckenbach, Trustee'; but it was admitted by all the petitioners that Edgar F. Luckenbach, Trustee, in so signing the charter party, acted for all the owners and intended to bind all. The decree in the District Court declares that libelant was entitled to recovery 'from the respondents Edgar F. Luckenbach et al., her owners.' The decree in the Circuit Court of Appeals adjudged (presumably through inadvertence) that the payment should be made by 'the estate of Luckenbach.' The right to recover against all the owners, for the full amount, in case any of them was so liable was not controverted.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be modified so as to render all the owners liable. Compare Pendleton v. Benner Line, \n246 U.S. 353\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 330. As so modified, the decree is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLYNCH v. HORNBY(1918)\nNo. 422\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 339, 340]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, for petitioner.\n Messrs. A. W. Clapp and Newell Clapp, both of St. Paul, Minn., and H. Oldenburg, of Carlton, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Hornby, the respondent, recovered a judgment in the United States District Court against Lynch, as Collector of Internal Revenue, for the return of $171, assessed as an additional income tax under the Act of October 3, 1913 (chapter 16, 38 Stat. 114, 166), and paid under protest. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment (236 Fed. 661, 149 C. C. A. 657), and the case comes here on certiorari. It was submitted at the same time with Lynch, Collector, v. Turrish, \n247 U.S. 221\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 537, 62 L. Ed. --, Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, Collector, \n247 U.S. 330\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 540, 62 L. Ed. --, and Peabody v. Eisner, Collector, \n247 U.S. 347\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 546, 62 L. Ed. --, arising under the same act, and this day decided.\n The facts, in brief, are as follows: Hornby, from 1906 to 1915, was the owner of 434 (out of 10,000) shares of the capital stock of the Cloquet Lumber Company, an Iowa corporation, which for more than a quarter of a century had been engaged in purchasing timber lands, manufacturing the timber into lumber, and selling it. Its shares had a par value of $100 each, making the entire capital stock $1,000,000. On and prior to March 1, 1913, by the increase of the value of its timber lands and through its business operations, the total property of the company had come to be worth $4,000,000, and Hornby's stock, the par value of which was $43,400, had become \n\n[247 U.S. 339, 341]\n\u00a0\n worth at least $150,000. In the year 1914 the company was engaged in cutting its standing timber, manufacturing it into lumber, selling the lumber, and distributing the proceeds among its stockholders. In that year it thus distributed dividends aggregating $650,000, of which $240,000, or 24 per cent. of the par value of the capital stock, was derived from current earnings, and $410,000 from conversion into money of property that it owned or in which it had an interest on March 1, 1913. Hornby's share of the latter amount was $17,794, and, this not having been included in his income tax return, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue levied an additional tax of $171 on account of it, and this forms the subject of the present suit.\n The case was tried in the District Court and argued in the Circuit Court of Appeals together with Lynch, Collector, v. Turrish, 236 Fed. 653, 149 C. C. A. 649, and was treated as presenting substantially the same question upon the merits. In our opinion it is distinguishable from the Turrish Case, where the distribution in question was a single and final dividend received by Turrish from the Payette Company in liquidation of the entire assets and business of the company and a return to him of the value of his stock upon the surrender of his entire interest in the company, at a price that represented its intrinsic value at and before March 1, 1913, when the Income Tax Act took effect.\n In the present case there was no winding up or liquidation of the Cloquet Lumber Company, nor any surrender of Hornby's stock. He was but one of many stockholders, and had but the ordinary stockholder's interest in the capital and surplus of the company; that is, a right to have them devoted to the proper business of the orporation and to receive from the current earnings or accumulated surplus such dividends as the directors in their discretion might declare. Gibbons v. Mahon, \n136 \nU.S. 549, 557\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 1057. The operations of this company in the year 1914 \n\n[247 U.S. 339, 342]\n\u00a0\n were, according to the facts pleaded, of a nature essentially like those in which it had been engaged for more than a quarter of a century. The fact that they resulted in converting into money, and thus setting free for distribution as dividends, a part of its surplus assets accumulated prior to March 1, 1913, does not render Hornby's share of those dividends any the less a part of his income within the true intent and meaning of the act, the pertinent language of which is as follows (38 Stat. 166, 167):\n'A. Subdivision 1. That there shall be levied, assessed, collected and paid annually upon the entire net income arising or accruing from all sources in the preceding calendar year to every citizen of the United States, ... and to every person residing in the United States, ... a tax of 1 per centum per annum upon such income, except as hereinafter provided. ...\n\n'B. That, subject only to such exemptions and deductions as are hereinafter allowed, the net income of a taxable person shall include gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service, ... also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any lawful business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.'\n\n Among the deductions allowed for the purpose of the normal tax is:\n'Seventh, the amount received as dividends upon the stock or from the net earnings of any corporation, ... which is taxable upon its net income as hereinafter provided.'\n\n There is a graduated additional tax, commonly known as a 'surtax,' upon net income in excess of $20,000, including income from dividends, and for the purpose of this additional tax--\n'the taxable income of any individual shall embrace the share to which he would be entitled of the gains and profits, if divided or distributed, whether divided or distributed or not, of all corporations ... formed or fraudulently \n\n[247 U.S. 339, 343]\n\u00a0\n availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of such tax through the medium of permitting such gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.'\n\n It is evident that Congress intended to draw and did draw a distinction between a stockholder's undivided share or interest in the gains and profits of a corporation, prior to the declaration of a dividend, and his participation in the dividends declared and paid; treating the latter, in ordinary circumstances, as a part of his income for the purposes of the surtax, and not regarding the former as taxable income unless fraudulently accumulated for the purpose of evading the tax.\n This treatment of undivided profits applies only to profits permitted to accumulate after the taking effect of the act, since only with respect to these is a fraudulent purpose of evading the tax predicable. Corporate profits that accumulated before the act took effect stand on a different footing. As to these, however, just as we deem the legislative intent manifest to tax the stockholder with respect to such accumulations only if and when, and to the extent that, his interest in them comes to fruition as income, that is, in dividends declared, so we can perceive no constitutional obstacle that stands in the way of carrying out this intent when dividends are declared out of a pre-existing surplus. The act took effect on March 1, 1913, a few days after the requisite number of states had given approval to the Sixteenth Amendment, under which for the first time Congress was empowered to tax income from property without apportioning the tax among the states according to population. Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, supra. That the retroactivity of the act from the date of its passage (October 3, 1913) to a d te not prior to the adoption of the amendment was permissible is settled by Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 236, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, L. R. A. 1917D, 414. And we deem it equally clear that Con- \n\n[247 U.S. 339, 344]\n\u00a0\n gress was at liberty under the amendment to tax as income, without apportionment, everything that became income, in the ordinary sense of the word, after the adoption of the amendment, including dividends received in the ordinary course by a stockholder from a corporation, even though they were extraordinary in amount and might appear upon analysis to be a mere realization in possession of an inchoate and contingent interest that the stockholder had in a surplus of corporate assets previously existing. Dividends are the appropriate fruit of stock ownership, are commonly reckoned as income, and are expended as such by the stockholder without regard to whether they are declared from the most recent earnings, or from a surplus accumulated from the earnings of the past, or are based upon the increased value of the property of the corporation. The stockholder is, in the ordinary case, a different entity from the corporation, and Congress was at liberty to treat the dividends as coming to him ab extra, and as constituting a part of his income when they came to hand.\n Hence we construe the provision of the act that 'the net income of a taxable person shall include gains, profits, and income derived from ... interest, rent, dividends, ... or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever' as including (for the purposes of the additional tax) all dividends declared and paid in the ordinary course of business by a corporation to its stockholders after the taking effect of the act ( March 1, 1913), whether from current earnings, or from the accumulated surplus made up of past earnings or increase in value of corporate assets, notwithstanding it accrued to the corporation in whole or in part prior to March 1, 1913. In short, the word 'dividends' was employed in the act as descriptive of one kind of gain to the individual stockholder; dividends being treated as the tangible and recurrent returns upon his stock, analogous to the in- \n\n[247 U.S. 339, 345]\n\u00a0\n terest and rent received upon other forms of invested capital.\n In the more recent Income Tax Acts, provisions have been inserted for the purpose of excluding from the effect of the tax any dividends declared out of earnings or profits that accrued prior to March 1, 1913. This originated with the act of September 8, 1916, and has been continued in the act of October 3, 1917.1 We are referred to the legislative history of the act of 1916, which it is contended indicates that the new definition of the term 'dividends' was intended to be declaratory of the* mean- \n\n[247 U.S. 339, 346]\n\u00a0\n ing of the term as used in the 1913 act. We cannot accept this suggestion, deeming it more reasonable to regard the change as a concession to the equity of stockholders granted in the 1916 act, in view of constitutional questions that had been raised in this case, in the companion case of Lynch, Collector, v. Turrish, and perhaps in other cases. These two cases were commenced in October, 1915; and decisions adverse to the tax were rendered in the District Court in January, 1916, and in the Circuit Court of Appeals September 4, 1916\n\n\n We repeat that under the 1913 act dividends declared and paid in the ordinary course by a corporation to its stockholders after March 1, 1913, whether from current earnings or from a surplus accumulated prior to that date, were taxable as income to the stockholder.\n We do not overlook the fact that every dividend distribution diminishes by just so much the assets of the corporation, and in a theoretical sense reduces the intrinsic value of the stock. But, at the same time, it demonstrates the capacity of the corporation to pay dividends, holds out a promise of further dividends in the future, and quite probably increases the market value of the shares. In our opinion, ongress laid hold of dividends paid in the ordinary course as de facto income of the stockholder, without regard to the ultimate effect upon the corporation resulting from their payment.\n Of course we are dealing here with the ordinary stockholder receiving dividends declared in the ordinary way of business. Lynch, Collector, v. Turrish and Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, Collector, this day decided, rest upon their special facts and are plainly distinguishable.\n It results from what we have said that it was erroneous to award a return of the tax collected from the respondent, and that the judgment should be\n Reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In Act Sept. 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 757, which took the place of the act of 1913, the substance of what we have quoted from paragraph B of the 1913 act was embodied in section 2(a), Comp. St. 1916,  6336b, but with this proviso; 'Provided, that the term 'dividends' as used in this title shall be held to mean any distribution made or ordered to be made by a corporation ... out of its earnings or profits accrued since March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, and payable to its shareholders, whether in cash or in stock of the corporation,' etc. And by Act Oct. 3, 1917, c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 329, 337, 338, section 2(a) of the 1916 act was amended by being repeated without the proviso (page 329), while the proviso was inserted as a new section-31(a)-and to it was added a subsection, (b), as follows:\n'(b) Any distribution made to the shareholders or members of a corporation ... in the year nineteen hundred and seventeen, or subsequent tax years, shall be deemed to have been made from the most recently accumulated undivided profits or suplus, and shall constitute a part of the annual income of the distributee for the year in which received, and shall be taxed to the distributee at the rates prescribed by law for the years in which such profits or surplus were accumulated by the corporation, ... but nothing herein shall be construed as taxing any earnings or profits accrued prior to March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, but such earnings or profits may be distributed in stock dividends or otherwise, exempt from the tax, after the distribution of earnings and profits accrued since March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, has been made. This subdivision shall not apply to any distribution made prior to August sixth, nineteen hundred and seventeen, out of earnings or profits accrued prior to March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","94":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLYNCH v. TURRISH(1918)\nNo. 421\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 221, 222]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, for petitioner.\n Messrs. A. W. Clapp and Newell Clapp, both of St. Paul, Minn., and H. Oldenburg, of Carleton, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit to recover an income tax, paid under protest, assessed under the Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 166.\n The facts, as admitted by demurrer, are these: Respondent, Turrish, who was plaintiff in the trial court, made a return of his income for the calendar year 1914 which showed that he had no net income for that year; afterwards the Commissioner of Internal Revenue made a supplemental assessment showing that he had received a net income of $32,712.08, which, because of specific deductions and exemptions, resulted in no normal tax, but as the net income exceeded the sum of $20,000 the Commissioner assessed an additional or super tax of 1 per cent. upon the excess, resulting in a tax of $127.12, \n\n[247 U.S. 221, 223]\n\u00a0\n which was sought to be recovered. The reassessment was based upon certain sums received by the plaintiff in the year 1914 as distributions from corporations subject to the Income Tax Law and held by the Commissioner to be ncome derived from dividends received by the plaintiff on stock of domestic corporations; of which the sum of $79,975, received as a distribution from the Payette Lumber & Manufacturing Company, and without which no tax could have been levied against the plaintiff, is here in dispute.\n Prior to March 1, 1913, and continuously thereafter until the surrender of his stock as hereinafter mentioned, plaintiff was a stockholder in the Payette Company, which was organized in the year 1903 with power to buy, hold, and sell timber lands, and in fact never engaged in any other business than this except minor businesses incidental to it. Immediately after its organization this company began to invest in timber lands, and prior to March 1, 1913, had thus invested approximately $1,375, 000.\n On March 1, 1913, the value of its assets was not less than $3,000, 000 of which sum the value of the timber lands was not less than $2,875, 000. The increase was due to the gradual rise in the market value of the lands. At that date the value of Turrish's stock was twice its par value, or $159,950, and about that time he and all the other stockholders gave an option to sell their stock for twice its par value. The holders of the option formed another company, called the Boise-Payette Lumber Company, and transferred the options to it. The options having been extended to December 31, 1913, the new company informed the Payette Company and its stockholders shortly before this date that instead of exercising the option it preferred and proposed to purchase all of the assets of the Payette Company, paying to that company such a purchase price that there would be \n\n[247 U.S. 221, 224]\n\u00a0\n available for distribution to its stockholders twice the par value of their stock. The stockholders by resolution authorized this sale, and, pursuant to this and a resolution of the directors, the Payette Company transferred to the new company all of its assets, property, and franchises, and upon the completion of the transaction found itself with no assets or property, except cash to the amount of double the par value of its stock which had been paid to it by the new company, and with no debt, liabilities, or obligations except those which the new company had assumed. The cash was distributed to the stockholders on the surrender of their certificates of stock, and the company went out of business. In this way, upon the surrender of his shares, Turrish received $159,950, being double their par value.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue considered that of this sum one- half was not taxable, being the liquidation of the par value of Turrish's stock, but that the other half was income for the year 1914 and taxable under the act of 1913\n\n\n The question in the case is thus indicated. The District Court took a different view from that of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and therefore overruled the demurrer to Turrish's complaint and entered judgment for him for the sum prayed, which judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 236 Fed. 653, 149 C. C. A. 649.\n The point in the case seems a short one. It, however, has provoked much discussion on not only the legal but the economic distinction between capital and income and by what processes and at what point of time the former produces or becomes the latter. And this in resolution of a statute which concerns the activities of men and intended, it might be supposed, to be without perplexities and readily solvable by the off-hand conceptions of those to whom it was addressed. \n\n[247 U.S. 221, 225]\n\u00a0\n The provisions of the act, so far as material to be noticed, are the following: That there is assessed\n'upon the entire net income arising or accruing from all sources in the preceding calendar year to every ... person residing in the United States ... a tax of 1 per centum per annum upon such income . ...' Paragraph A, subd. 1.\n\n In addition to that tax, which is denominated the normal income tax, it is provided that there shall be levied 'upon the net in ome of every individual an additional income tax ... of 1 per centum per annum upon the amount by which the total income exceeds' certain amounts, and the person subject to the tax is required to make a personal return of his total net income from all sources under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Subdivision 2.\n By paragraph B it is provided that, subject to certain exemptions and deductions,\n'the net income of a taxable person shall include gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service ... also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any lawful business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.'\n\n After specifying the exemptions and deductions allowed, the law declares as follows:\n'The said tax shall be computed upon the remainder of said net income of each person subject thereto, accruing during each preceding calendar year ending December thirty-first: Provided, however, that for the year ending December thirty-first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, said tax shall be computed on the net income accruing from March first to December thirty-first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, both dates inclusive. ...' Paragraph D.\n\n It will be observed, therefore, that the statute levies a normal tax and an additional tax upon net incomes, \n\n[247 U.S. 221, 226]\n\u00a0\n derived from whatever source, 'arising or accruing' each preceding calendar year ending December 31, except that for the year ending December 31, 1913, the tax shall be computed on the net income accruing from March 1, 1913, to December 31, 1913.\n And in determining the application of the statute to Turrish we must keep in mind that on the admitted facts the distribution received by him from the Payette Company manifestly was a single and final dividend in liquidation of the entire assets and business of the company, a return to him of the value of his stock upon the surrender of his entire interest in the company, and at a price that represented its intrinsic value at and before March 1, 1913, when the act took effect.\n The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the amount so distributed to Turrish was not income within the meaning of the statute, basing the decision on two propositions, as expressed in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, by Sanborn, Circuit Judge: (a) The amount was the realization of an investment made some years before, representing its gradual increase during those years, and which reached its height before the effective date of the law; that is, before March 1, 1913, and the mere change of form of the property 'as from real to personal property, or from stock to cash' was not income to its holders because the value of the property was the same after as before the change. ( b) The timber lands were the property, capital and capital assets, of their legal and equitable owner and the enhancement of their value during a series of years 'prior to the effective date of the income tax law, although divided or distributed by dividend or otherwise subsequent to that date, does not become income, gains, or profits taxable under such an act.'\n For proposition (a) the court cited Collector v. Hubbard, 12 Wall. 1; Bailey v. Railroad Company, 22 Wall. \n\n[247 U.S. 221, 227]\n\u00a0\n 604, and the same case in \n106 U.S. 109\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 62. For proposition (b) Gray v. Darlington, 15 Wall. 63, was relied on.\n The government opposes both contentions by an elaborate argument containing definitions of capital and income drawn from legal and economic sources and given breadth to cover a number of other cases submitted with this. The argument, in effect, makes any increase of value of property income, emerging as such and taxable at the moment of realization by sale or some act of separation, as by dividend declared or by distribution, as in the instant case.\n To sustain the argument these definition are presented:\n'1. Capital is anything, material or otherwise, capable of ownership, viewed in its static condition at a moment of time, or the rights of ownership therein. 2. Income is the service or return rendered by capital during a period of time. ... 4. Net income ('profits') is the difference between income and outgo. ... 7. In the actual production and distribution of capital there is a constant conversion of capital into income, and vice versa. 8. The attempt to conceal this conversion by treating 'income' as the standard return from intact 'capital' only leads to confusion of the value of capital with capital itself.'\n\n From these definitions are deduced the following propositions, which are said to be decisive of the problems in the cases:\n'1. Income being derived from the use of capital, the conversion or transfer of capital always produces income. 2. Mere appreciation of capital value does not produce 'income,' nor mere depreciation 'outgo.' 3. Net income is the difference between actual 'income' and actual 'outgo.' 4. Income is not confined to money income, but includes anything capable of easy valuation in money.'\n\n It will be observed that the breadth of definition and \n\n[247 U.S. 221, 228]\n\u00a0\n the breadth of application are necessary to the refutation of the reasoning of the Circuit Court of Appeals. There is direct antagonism, the court basing its reliance, it says, upon what it asserts is the common sense and understanding of the words of the law, and the exposition of like laws by the decisions of this court. The government's resource is the discussion of economists and the fact, concrete and practical, of wealth not only increased but come to actual hand. The instant case is an example. Turrish's stock doubled in value. He paid for it $79,975; he received $159, 950. It requires a struggle to resist the influence of the fact, but we are aided and fortified by our own precedents and saved from much intricate and subtle discussion and an elaborate review of other cases cited in confirmation or opposition.\n In Collector v. Hubbard, supra, the distinction between a corporation and its stockholders was recognized and that the stockholder had no title for certain purposes to the earnings of the coproration, net or other, prior to a dividend being declared, but they might become capital by investment in permanent improvements and thereby increase the market value of the shares, 'whether held by the original subscribers or by assignees.' In other words, it was held that the investments of the corporation were the investments of the stockholders; that is, the stockholders could have an interest, taxable under the act considered, though not identical with the corporation. This was repeated in Bailey v. Railroad Company, 22 Wall. 604, 635, 636.\n The latter case came here again in \n106 U.S. 109\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 62, and it was then declared that the purpose of an income tax law was to tax the income for the year that it accrued; in other words, no tax in contemplation of the law accrues upon something except for the year in which that something-earnings, profits, gains or income-accrues. In that case the subject of the tax was a scrip dividend, but \n\n[247 U.S. 221, 229]\n\u00a0\n the certificates did not whow the year of the earnings and testimony as to the particular year was admitted. The principle applies to the case at bar. If increase in value of the lands was income, it had its particular time and such time must have been within the time of the law to be subject to the law, that is, it must have been after March 1, 1913. But, according to the fact admitted, there was no increase after that date and therefore no increase subject to the law. There was continuity of value, not gain or increase. In the first proposition of the Court of Appeals we, therefore, concur.\n In support of its second proposition it adduced, as we have seen, Gray v. Darlington, 15 Wall. 62. The case arose under the Income Tax Law of 1867 (Act March 2, 1867, c. 169, 14 St t. 478), which levied 'upon the gains, profits, and income of every person, ... whether derived from any kind of property ... or from any other source whatever a tax of five per centum on the amount so derived over $1,000 ... for the year ending the thirty-first day of December next preceding the time for levying, collecting, and paying said tax.'\n Darlington, in 1865, being the owner of certain United States Treasury notes, exchanged them for United States bonds. In 1869 he sold the bonds at an advance of $20,000 over the cost of the notes and upon this amount was levied a tax of five per centum as gains, profits and income for that year. He paid the tax under protest and sued to recover, and prevailed. This court, by Mr. Justice Field, said:\n'The question presented is whether the advance in the value of the bonds, during this period of four years, over their cost, realized by their sale, was subject to taxation as gains, profits, or income of the plaintiff for the year in which the bonds were sold. The answer which should be given to this question does not, in our judgment, admit of any doubt. The advance in the value of property during a series of years can, in no \n\n[247 U.S. 221, 230]\n\u00a0\n just sense, be considered the gains, profits, or income of any one particular year of the series, although the entire amount of the advance be at one time turned into money by the sale of the property. The statute looks, with some exceptions, for subjects of taxation only to annual gains, profits, and income.'\n\n And again:\n'The mere fact that property has advanced in value between the date of its acquisition and sale does not authorize the imposition of a tax on the amount of the advance. Mere advance in value in no sense constitutes the gains, profits, or income specified by the statute. It constitutes and can be treated merely as increase of capital.'\n\n This case has not been since questioned or modified.\n The government feels the impediment of the case and attempts to confine its ruling to the exact letter of the Act of March 2, 1867, and thereby distinguish that act from the act 1913 and give to the latter something of retrospective effect. Opposed to this there is a presumption, resistless except against an intention imperatively clear. The government, however, makes its view depend upon disputable differences between certain words of the two acts. It urges that the act of 1913 makes the income taxed one 'arising or accruing' in the preceding calendar year, while the act of 1867 makes the income one 'derived.' Granting that there is a shade of difference between the words, it cannot be granted that Congress made that shade a criterion of intention and committed the construction of its legislation to the disputes of purists. Besides, the contention of the government does not reach the principle of Gray v. Darlington, which is that the gradual advance in the value of property during a series of years in no just sense can be ascribed to a particular year, not therefore as 'arising or accruing,' to meet the challenge of the words, in the last one of the years, as the government contends, and taxable as income \n\n[247 U.S. 221, 231]\n\u00a0\n for that year or when turned into cash. Indeed, the case decides that such advance in value is not income at all, but merely increase of capital and not subject to a tax as income.\n We concur, therefore, in the second proposition of the Circuit Court of Appeals as well as in the first and affirm the judgment.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","95":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMACMATH v. U S(1918)\nNo. 79\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 151, 152]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William E. Russell, of New York City, and L. T. Michener, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Thompson, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n When an office with a fixed salary has been created by statute, and a person duly appointed to it has qualified and entered upon the discharge of his duties, he is entitled during his incumbency to be paid the salary prescribed by statute; and effect will not be given to any attempt to deprive him of the right thereto, whether it be by unauthorized agreement, by condition, or otherwise. United States v. Andrews, \n240 U.S. 90\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 349; Glavey v. United States, \n182 U.S. 595\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 891\n\n\n Section 3 of the Act of July 26, 1866, c. 269 (14 Stat. 289), provides, that weighers at the port of New York shall receive an annual salary of $2,500. Section 2621 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. 1916,  5359) authorizes collectors to employ, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, weighers at the several ports; and it does not prescribe their number. Section 2634 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to fix the number and compensation of clerks to be employed by any collector. The statutes appear to have made no specific provision for the appointment of assistant or acting United States weighers. On May 12, 1909, plaintiff's intestate (who had been appointed on August 1, 1896, 'assistant weigher of customs' at a salary, 'when employed,' of $3 diem, and had later received a like appointment at $4 per diem) was appointed by the collector 'clerk, class 3, new office, to act as acting U. S. weigher' with compensation at the rate \n\n[248 U.S. 151, 153]\n\u00a0\n of $1,600 per annum. On August 18, 1911, he received a like appointment as clerk, class 4, at the rate of $1,800 per annum. He continued to perform the duties assigned and was paid the salary named until his death, October 8, 1913. In February, 1915, his administratrix filed with the Auditor of the Treasury a claim for salary of her intestate as 'United States weigher of customs' at the rate of $2,500 per annum, from May 12, 1909, to and including October 7, 1913. Upon disallowance of the claim she brought this suti in the Court of Claims for the amount, namely, $11,013.89. The court found for the defendant and entered judgment dismissing the petition. 51 Ct. Cl. 356. The case comes here on appeal.\n There is a fundamental objection to the allowance of the claim or any part thereof. MacMath was never appointed weigher and never held office as such. His only appointment was that of clerk; his oath of office being 'as clerk and acting U. S. weigher, class 3.' The Secretary of the Treasury clearly had the right to create and the collector to make appointment to the position of clerk and to designate duties of the appointee. The fact that the incumbent performed also some or all the duties of a weigher does not operate to promote him automatically to the statutory office of weigher. And the fact that his appointment as clerk in 1909 was made as a part of a reorganization of the service, whereby four of the five positions of United States weigher were abolished, is immaterial; except as showing even more clearly that it was the intention not to appoint him weigher. No contention is, or could successfully be, made that the weighing should be paid for as an extra service, even if it was not a duty attaching to his position as clerk. See United States v. Garlinger, \n169 U.S. 316\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 364.\n We have, therefore, no occasion to consider whether effect should be given to the agreement by the intestate not to make claim to compensation as acting weigher, or \n\n[248 U.S. 151, 154]\n\u00a0\n to his acceptance of the lower compensation without protest during the entire term of his service; nor need we consider the effect of section 2 of the act of July 31, 1894, c. 174 (28 Stat. 162, 205 [Comp. St. 1916,  3231]), which provides that--\n'No person who holds an office the salary or annual compensation attached to which amounts to the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars shall be appointed to or hold any other office to which compensation is attached unless specially heretofore or hereafter specially authorized thereto by law.'\n\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMANUFACTURERS' RY. CO. v. U S(1918)\nNo. 24\nArgued: Decided: April 15, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 457, 460]\n\u00a0\n Petition by the Manufacturers' Railway Company and the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company against the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission to enjoin the enforcement of orders of the Commission; together with a petition by the Manufacturers' Railway Company and the Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association and others against the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission to enjoin orders of the Commission. The petitions were in both instances dismissed, and petitioners in each case appeal. Affirmed.\n These are appeals from final decrees made by the District Court in two cases dismissing petitions filed by the appellants for the purpose of enjoining the enforcement of orders made by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The cases are closely related to each other, were argued at the same time, and will be disposed of in a single opinion.\n The facts are intricate, and have been the subject of consideration by the Commission in three reports (21 I. C. C. 304; 28 I. C. C. 93; 32 I. C. C. 100), from which the following resume is taken:\n Situate in South St. Louis, within the limits of the city of St. Louis, M ssouri, and on the high ground back from the Mississippi River, are the great industrial plans of the Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association, a corporation, hereinafter called the Brewery, which occupy approximately 126 acres-35 or 40 city blocks-intersected by streets. There are numerous structures, in which are conducted the manufacture and marketing of beer and related products. The tonnage shipped by and to the Brewery is very heavy, amounting to upwards of 40,000 carloads per annum, or approximately one-thirtieth of all the inbound and outbound traffic of the entire city. For a number of years following the establishment of the Brewery its inbound raw materials and outbound products were drawn by horse and wagon from and to the tracks of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway Company, hereinafter called the Iron Mountain, \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 461]\n\u00a0\n on the river front. In the year 1885 this method was abandoned and a plant railway operated by steam was substituted. Two years later the plaintiff Manufacturers' Railway Company was incorporated, hereinafter referred to as the Railway, to which control and operation of the plant system was made over. The Railway now has a main line of 2 1\/4 miles, and approximately 23 miles of side tracks. It is engaged exclusively in the switching and delivery of carload freight within the city of St. Louis. The traffic of the Brewery constitutes about 75 per cent. of ths total tonnage. At the time of the hearing before the Commission, it owned no cars and only four locomotives; the cars used for the transportation of shipments originating on its line being furnished principally by the St. Louis Refrigerator Car Company, a substantial portion of whose stock is owned by the holders of a majority of the stock of the Brewery. The facilities of the Railway, however, for a considerable period and to a large extent had been available to the public, and it was held by the Commission to be a common carrier, and not a mere industrial or tap line. But a majority of the stock of the Railway was and is owned by the owners of a majority of the stock of the Brewery, so that the same interest controls both properties.\n In the year 1888 the Railway leased its tracks to the Iron Mountain for ten years, and in 1898 renewed the lease for ten years. Up to this time the only outlet from the rails of the Railway was to the main line of the Iron Mountain on the bank of the Mississippi River. In 1903 the Railway undertook a further development of its terminal facilities, and the city authorized several extensions along certain streets, and leased to it a part of a public wharf. In 1908 the Railway declined to grant a further lease to the Iron Mountain, and took over the operation of its property, with the object of enlarging and extending its facilities, serving the public in that \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 462]\n\u00a0\n portion of the city generally, and connecting with all St. Louis lines by a junction with the St. Louis Transfer Railway.\n The principal terminal facilities of the city of St. Louis are dominated by the Terminal Railroad Association, hereinafter referred to as the Terminal, a corporation whose capital stock is owned in equal shares by the 14 trunk lines entering that city. The Terminal, or its proprietary or tenant lines, owns or controls all bridges and ferries giving access to terminals within and lines directly entering St. Louis, so that no interstate shipment can enter or leave the city except over those lines. In St. Louis there are three industrial centers naturally requiring terminal facilities. The northern section of the city along the Mississippi River is one of these, and is served by a considerable mileage of the Terminal and the rails of nine of the trunk lines. In the western section, in what is known as the Mill Creek Valley, there are many industries served by a considerable mileage of the Terminal and the rails of four of the trunk lines. In South St. Louis the companies rendering terminal service are the Manufacturers' Railway and the Iron Mountain. The St. Louis Transfer Company, one of th subsidiaries of the Terminal, has a line along the river bank, physically available only to a negligible extent, and the lines of the Iron Mountain generally follow the bank of the river and reach such industries as are adjacent thereto. For a considerable distance along the river in this section of the city there is a steep grade to be overcome in reaching industries situate back from the river, and to confine these industries to the terminal facilities of the Iron Mountain would require a team haul up from the bank of the river. The Railway's terminals reach the high ground referred to, and besides its connection with the Iron Mountain it constructed in 1908 a viaduct leading over the Iron Mountain tracks and then descending to \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 463]\n\u00a0\n their level and forming a connection with the tracks of the Transfer Railway, which lie between the Iron Mountain and the river. Through the Transfer Railway it reaches the Terminal, and through the Terminal reaches all the trunk lines that enter St. Louis. The Transfer Railway is a corporation whose stock is owned by the Wiggins Ferry Company, whose stock in turn is owned by some of the trunk lines that own and control the Terminal.\n The St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company, a trunk line hereinafter called the Cotton Belt, does not reach St. Louis with its own rails, but enters East St. Louis via the rails of the Iron Mountain, over which it has trackage rights. In serving industries within St. Louis it uses the facilities of the Terminal and of the various carriers within the city, including the Railway.\n By ordinance of the city of St. Louis the Railway is prohibited from charging more than $2 per car for local switching. Prior to March 1, 1910, and including the entire 20-year period covered by the leases of the Railway to the Iron Mountain, the trunk lines applied their St. Louis rates to traffic originating at or destined to industries served by the Railway, absorbing and paying to the Railway, after the termination of the Iron Mountain lease, a switching charge of from $3 to $5.50 per car, said to average about $4.50. The result of this was that shippers served by the Railway received their transportation at the St. Louis rates without paying anything additional for the terminal service performed by the Railway.\n At the same time the trunk lines absorbed the terminal charges of the Terminal (about $3 per car), and similar allowances or absorptions were made by the trunk lines to twelve other industrial lines in and about the city.\n About December 31, 1909, the trunk lines by concerted \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 464]\n\u00a0\n action notified the Railway that from and after March 1, 1910, they would cancel the tariffs wherein they had applied the St. Louis rates to industries on the Railway and had absorbed the Railway's terminal charges. Similar notice was given to the twelve other industrial lines, and accordingly the allowances were canceled at the date notified, but the practice of absorbing the charges of the Terminal was not discontinued.\n On March 4, 1910, the Railway and certain shippers on its line, including the Brewery, filed a complaint against the trunk lines before the Commission (I. C. C. Docket No. 3151), in which it was alleged that the tariff cancellations were in effect an unjust and unlawful refusal by the trunk lines longer to continue through routes and joint rates theretofore established; that said action constituted an unlawful discrimination as between industries and shippers on the lines of the Railway and other industries and shippers in St. Louis, and subjected the traffic of the Railway to undue and unreasonable disadvantage, and gave undue and unreasonable preference to the shipping public in other parts of St. Louis; and further that the concerted action of the trunk lines was the result of an unlawful combination and conspiracy, in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Law (Comp. St. 1916,  8820 et seq.). Complainants asked that through routes and joint rates be re-established to and from points on the Railway from and to points on each of the trunk lines and points beyond, and that proper and reasonable divisions of the through or joint rates be established. There was also a prayer for reparation and for general relief.\n The trunk lines answered, evidence was taken (none, however, being introduced by the trunk lines beyond such as was brought out by examination of complainants' witnesses), and, after a hearing, the Commission, under date June 21, 1911, filed a first report of its conclusions. 21 I. C. C. 304. It declared that the Railway was a \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 465]\n\u00a0\n common carrier, within the provisions of the first section of the Commerce Act, and not a mere plant facility of the Brewery; that it supplied reasonable and necessary terminal facilities to many industries besides the Brewery; and that the payment of it by the trunk lines of a reasonable and just portion of the St. Louis rates for the terminal service rendered by it was not unlawful; that the action of the trunk lines in canceling the divisions and absorptions which for many years had been included in the St. Louis rates had subjected complainant shippers and a considerable portion of the public of South St. Louis to the payment of unjust and unreasonable transportation charges and to undue discrimination and disadvantage; that there had been in effect a failure on the part of the complainant carrier and defendants to agree to the apportionment or division of the rates or charges, and this situation under the statute imposed upon the Commission the duty of adjusting the matter; that in view of the peculiar features of the case detailed in the report (including the heavy shipments to and from the Brewery, and the fact that the same interests owned a majority of the stock of the Railway and of the Brewery), it was important that the allowances to the Railway and the services rendered by it to its partrons in consideration of such allowances should be equitably adjusted, and that the trunk lines should closely guard these features in making any allowances or divisions to the Railway, in order to avoid the charge of unjust discrimination or undue preference or advantage; but that the record before the Commission did not present a sufficient basis for a satisfactory determination of the question as to the reasonable and just division or allowance to the Railway, and the further question as to whether a part of the service performed by it was or was not plant facility service. These questions were reserved for further examination.\n After the hearing, and before the making of this first \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 466]\n\u00a0\n report, practically all of the carriers published and filed tariffs stating allowances or divisions with the Railway. These were suspended by the Commission pending its decision, and upon the making of the first report an order was entered canceling the suspensions, effective July 15, 1911. No other order was made at that time.\n Thereafter a supplemental hearing was had upon which additional evidence was submitted by the trunk lines, and as a result the Commission filed its second report, dated June 21, 1913 (28 I. C. C. 93), but still made no order. In this report the Commission (page 105) adhered to its former conclusion that the Railway was a common carrier subject to the act, but in other respects materially modified its views, now holding: That the payments, formerly made out of their through rates by the trunk lines to the Railway were absorptions in compensation for services rendered to the trunk lines, and were not divisions of joint rates as for services rendered for the shippers served by the Railway, as they would be considered under joint rates prescribed by order of the Commission; that in the absence of any undue discrimination with respect to these absorptions the Commission could make no lawful order with reference thereto; that the defendant trunk lines, in delivering freight at the St. Louis rates to points on the rails of the Terminal and in refusing to bear the expense of similar delivery by the Railway upon its rails, were not subjecting the shippers located on and served by the Railway to undue p ejudice and disadvantage; that therefore the only lawful order the Commission could make was in the establishment of joint rates, under which that part of the service performed by the Railway would be in the contemplation of the Commerce Act a service performed for the shipper, to be paid for by him, and not a service rendered for the trunk lines, the expense of which could be required by the Commission to be borne by them; that the trunk line rates to \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 467]\n\u00a0\n St. Louis not being shown to be unreasonable in themselves, the joint rates with the Railway necessarily must be in excess of these by the amount of the Railway's part of the through charge, and that joint through rates should be established on that basis. Taking up the question of the amount to be added to the trunk line rates in making the joint rates, the existing allowances being, as stated, from $3 to $5.50 per car, and complainants asking for a uniform allowance of $4.50 per car, said to be lower on the average, the Commission called attention to the fact that the Railway's rate for local shipments between any points on its line was $2 per car, fixed as a maximum by city ordinance; for intraplant movements, availed of only by the Brewery-that being the only industry having need for such service-$1 per car; and for weighing movements 25 cents per car; and that the Railway had a contract with the Cotton Belt under which it handled shipments for the latter, under certain exemptions from liability for damage, for $1 per car, and had offered the same contract to other carriers. Considering these facts with the other testimony submitted on this phase of the case, the Commission expressed the opinion that the division of the joint rates accruing to the Railway should not exceed $2 per car, saying:\n'However, we shall not by definite finding and order fix these divisions now. This is our original finding with respect to the establishment of joint rates, and the carriers, in accordance with the provisions of the act, will be given an opportunity to agree among themselves.'\n\n In conclusion the Commission announced:\n'We regard the present allowances, which, as stated, average slightly above $4.50 per car, as effecting unlawful results.'\n\n Following the partial decision of the Commission in its first report, most of the trunk lines reinstated the allowances to the Railway, and those allowances, averaging about $4.50 per car, were being paid at the time of \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 468]\n\u00a0\n the making of the second report. Pursuant to that report, they were canceled.\n In this situation the Railway, the Brewery, and other complainant shippers applied to the Commission for a rehearing, and the case was reargued and taken under advisement November 13, 1913. Pending its decision, and on December 7, 1913, the Cotton Belt and another trunk line, both defendants in I. C. C. Docket No. 3251, published and filed with the Commission tariffs to become effective January 7, 1914, providing for absorption of the switching charges of the Railway up to $4.50 per car. These absorptions were suspended by order of the Commission December 19, 1913, until May 7, 1914, and by an order dated April 20, 1914, were suspended for a further period of six months, or until November 7, 1914. The suspension case was designated as Investigation and Suspension Docket No. 355, and was treated by the Commission as ancillary to the principal case, I. C. C. Docket No. 3151\n\n\n Under date July 10, 1914, and prior to the expiration of the second period of suspension, the Commission filed its third and final report, 32 I. C. C. 100. It affirmed the findings and conclusions contained in the second report, with an 'interpretation'; still dealt with the Railway as a common carrier; held that the trunk lines by their action in canceling the allowances to the Railway while continuing to absorb the charge of the Terminal, whose stock they owned, did not subject the Railway or its shippers to undue prejudice or disadvantage; that the amounts formerly paid by the trunk lines to the Railway were voluntary allowances and could not be considered by the Commission to be divisions of joint rates which it could by affirmative order establish; that the separate rates of the trunk lines and of the Railway being necessarily regarded upon the record before the Commission as prima facie reasonable, any joint rates which \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 469]\n\u00a0\n the Commission could by affirmative order require the carriers in the through route to establish would necessarily be higher than the trunk line rates to and from St. Louis by the amount of that part of the through charge which would accrue to the Railway; that while the Commission could not require the trunk lines to participate with the Railway in joint rates no higher than their rates to St. Louis, they might voluntarily participate on that basis, provided that in the division they did not pay to the Railway for its service more than was just and reasonable, and did not thereby in the amount of the excess indirectly refund to the Brewery a part of the through transportation charges paid to them by the Brewery; that the former allowances of $4.50 per car paid by the trunk lines to the Railway were excessive; and, instead of a maximum division to the Railway of $2 per car, as suggested in the second report, upon further consideration the view was expressed that the division accruing to the Railway should not exceed $2.50 per car, subject to modification upon further hearings with respect to divisions if the necessity should arise.\n In announcing its purpose to make an order requiring the establishment and maintenance by complainant Railway and defendant trunk lines of maximum joint rates not exceeding the St. Louis rates of the trunk lines by more than $2.50 per car, the Commission declared that when this had been done, whether the carriers in the through routes should establish rates on that maximum basis, or by voluntary agreement on a basis not higher than the St. Louis rates, then, upon failure of the trunk lines and the Railway to agree upon the proper basis of division, and upon request made to the Commission for the purpose, it would fix the divisions upon further investigation as provided in the act; if that inquiry should confirm its present impression that $2.50 per car was a reasonable division to the Railway, that would be granted; \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 470]\n\u00a0\n and if, on the other hand, the Commission should be convinced by the evidence that $2.50 per car was too much or not enough, it would fix the amount accordingly; and that if not asked by the carriers to fix the divisions, the Commission, upon proper cause appearing, might in its discretion institute an inquiry upon its own motion, under those provisions of the act which forbid the giving or receiving of rebates or undue concessions, directly or indirectly, by any device whatsoever, having in mind particularly the fact of the common ownership of Railway and Brewery stock.\n Thereupon an order was made under I. C. C. Docket No. 3151, dated July 10, 1914, requiring the trunk lines and the Railway on or before January 1, 1915, to cease and desist from charging their then present rates on traffic between points on the line of the Railway and points on the trunk lines in other states to the extent that those rates exceeded contemporaneous St. Louis rates by more than $2.50 per car, and to put in force on or before the same date and maintain thereafter for a period of not less than two years rates applicable to traffic on the Railway not exceeding rates contemporaneously in effect between St. Louis and points in other states by more than $2.50 per car.\n At the same time, and upon the the basis of the same report, an order was made under I. & S. Docket No. 355, canceling the Cotton Belt tariff that had been suspended by the orders of December 19, 1913, and April 20, 1914.\n The former order of July 10 was attacked in a suit brought in the District Court by the Railway, in which the Brewery and other shippers on the line of the Railway intervened as co-petitioners. Answers were filed by the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission, evidenc was taken, and upon final hearing the suit was dismissed, without opinion. No. 25 is an appeal from \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 471]\n\u00a0\n this decree. The orders of April 20 and July 10 under I. & S. Docket No. 355 were the subject of attack in a suit by the Railway and the Cotton Belt, in which answers were filed by the United States and by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and upon evidence taken the court, without opinion, dismissed the petition. From this decree the appeal in No. 24 was taken.\n Messrs. Sidney F. Andrews, Daniel N. Kirby, Edward A. Haid, and Charles Nagel, all of St. Louis, Mo., for appellants.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 457, 477]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Blackburn Esterline, of Chicago, Ill., and Charles W. Needham, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. Joseph W. Folk, of St. Louis, Mo., for Interstate Commerce Commission. \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 478]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, having made the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n It will be convenient to dispose first of No. 25.\n The scope of the order of July 10, 1914, under I. C. C. Docket No. 3151, is simple and limited; the grounds of attack upon it are many and diverse, and based rather upon what it does not, than upon what it does, require to be done. As is pointed out in the prefatory statement, the complaint before the Commission was made by the Railway, the Brewery, and certain other shippers served by the Railway. The respondents were the trunk lines. The complaint charged that the then recent tariff cancellations were in effect a refusal to continue through routes and joint rates from and to points on the line of the Railway; alleged that this constituted unreasonable discrimination between shippers on the line of the Railway and other shippers in the city of St. Louis, and subjected the former to undue prejudice and disadvantage, contrary to section 3 of the Commerce Act (24 Stat. 379, 380, c. 104); and prayed that the trunk lines be required to re-establish the through routes and joint rates as they existed before the cancellations, that the reasonable divisions of the rates be determined, and that due reparation be awarded to the complainants, with such other relief as the Commission might deem necessary. The order under consideration, recognizing through routes as being already in effect (a fact about which there is no dispute), required the Railway and the trunk lines to establish, and for at least two years to maintain, rates not exceeding by more than $2.50 per car the trunk line rates contemporaneously in effect between St. Louis and points in other states.\n It is urged that the cancellation of the absorption tariffs on March 1, 1910, constituted an increase of the former rates because it curtailed the service to be rendered under those rates; that the former absorptions presumably resulted in reasonable rates (Interstate Com. Com. v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. R. Co., \n186 \nU.S. 320, 336\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 824); that by the 'increased rate clause' of section 15 of the Commerce Act as amended in 1910 (36 Stat. 552, ch. 309),1 the burden was upon the trunk lines to show \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 479]\n\u00a0\n the reasonableness of the new rates; and that, there being no evidence to sustain their reasonableness per se, the Commission erred in law in failing to set them aside by restoring the former absorptions.\n But this clause of section 15, by the fair import of tis terms, imposes upon the carrier the burden of proving the new rate to be just and reasonable, only where that question is involved in the hearing; it does not call for proof as to matters not in controversy. As the Commission pointed out in its several reports (21 I. C. C. 308; 28 I. C. C. 100, 101, 103, 105, 110; 32 I. C. C. 102, 105), the complaint was not directed to the reasonableness of the separate rates either of the Railway (one of the complainants) or of the trunk lines. The effort was to require the reestablishment of the former absorptions on the ground that without them the continued practice of absorbing the charges of the Terminal constituted a discrimination as against shippers on the line of the Railway. And w en the question of discrimination was finally decided against the contention of the complainants, and the claim of the Railway to be regarded as a common carrier was decided in their favor (both conclusions being supported by adequate evidence), it appearing that through routes actually were in effect after as before the cancellations, the Commission deemed it unnecessary to do more at that time than to fix a maximum for the joint rates, and then await the voluntary action of the Railway and the trunk lines about establishing joint rates within the maximum, and agreeing between themselves respecting divisions.\n The question of the reasonablencess of the allowances or divisions made and to be made to the Railway came into the case incidentally, but inevitably, because of the heavy shipments to and from the Brewery and the community of interest between it and the Railway. Upon this point there was abundant evidence to support the conclusion of the Commission that in making up the \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 480]\n\u00a0\n joint rates not more than $2.50 per car should be added to the trunk line rates to St. Louis, and the intimation (not final, and not carried into the order) that any division to the Railway out of the joint rate in excess of $2.50 per car would amount to an undue preference or indirect rebate to the Brewery. Beyond this, no question of separate rates was involved, and the Commission did not err, in view of the issues, in assuming the trunk line rates to be reasonable per se. Althouth it might have dealt with the divisions in the same order, so far as necessary to prevent undue favoring of the Brewery (O'Keefe v. United States, \n240 U.S. 294\n, 300-302, 36 Sup. Ct. 313), it was within the discretion of the Commission to allow the carriers to make their own agreement upon the subject, as contemplated by the first paragraph of section 15 of the act (36 Stat. 551), subject to its review.\n It is insisted that the 'advanced rates' resulting from canceling the absorptions were presumptively unreasonable because not established by free competition but by concerted action in furtherance of the aims of the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis, held by this court to be an unlawful combination in restraint of interstate commerce. United States v. St. Louis Terminal, \n224 U.S. 383\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 507. But our decision in that case (\n224 U.S. 412\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 507; \n236 U.S. 207\n-209, 35 Sup. Ct. 408) left untouched the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Besides, appellants sought no special relief because of the Anti-Trust Act. Hence at the utmost they were only entitled to have the Commission consider the nature and objects of the Terminal Association as circumstances bearing upon the question of discrimination and other questions to which they were pertinent; and this the Commission did. 21 I. C. C. 308, 314; 28 I. C. C. 98, 104-106, 109-110; 32 I. C. C. 102.\n It is insisted, however, that the finding to the effect that it was not an undue or unjust discrimination for the trunk lines to refuse to absorb the Railway's charges and \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 481]\n\u00a0\n thereby extend their flat St. Louis rates to the territory served by the Railway, while doing so with respect to the territory served by the Terminal, is contrary to the indisputable character of the testimony and inconsistent in law with the very facts found by the Commission. To this we cannot accede. It is not any and every discrimination, preference, and prejudice that are denounced by the Commerce Act. Section 3 (Act of February 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 380) renders unlawful any 'undue or unreasonable' preference or advantage, prejudice or disadvantage. In the same section the requirement of 'all reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic' is qualified so as not to require one carrier to give the use of its tracks or terminal facilities to another. And in the first paragraph of amended section 15 (36 Stat. 551) it is rates, regulations, or paracties that in the opinion of the Com ission are 'unjustly discriminatory, or unduly preferential or prejudicial,' etc., to which the prohibition is to be applied.\n Whether a preference or advantage or discrimination is undue or unreasonable or unjust is one of those questions of fact that have been confided by Congress to the judgment and discretion of the Commission ( Interstate Comm. Comm. v. Alabama Midland Ry., \n168 \nU.S. 144, 170\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 45), and upon which its decisions, made the basis of administrative orders operating in futuro, are not to be disturbed by the courts except upon a showing that they are unsupported by evidence, were made without a hearing, exceed constitutional limits, or for some other reason amount to an abuse of power. This results from the provisions of sections 15 and 16 of the Commerce Act as amended in 1906 and 1910 (34 Stat. 589-591, c. 3591; 36 Stat. 551-554, c. 309), expounded in familiar decisions. Interstate Comm. Comm. v. Illinois Central R. R., \n215 \nU.S. 452, 469\n, 470 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 155; Interstate Comm. Comm. v. Union Pacific R. R., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 108; Procter & \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 482]\n\u00a0\n Gamble v. United States, \n225 U.S. 282\n, 297-298, 32 Sup. Ct. 761; Interstate Comm. Comm. v. Louisville & Nashville R. R., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 185.\n In the present case the negative finding of the Commission upon the question of undue discrimination was based upon a consideration of the different conditions of location, ownership, and operation as between the Railway and the Terminal. 28 I. C. C. 104, 105; 32 I. C. C. 102. The conclusions were reached after full hearing, are not without support in the evidence, and we are unable to say that they show an abuse of discretion. It may be conceded that the evidence would have warranted a different finding; indeed, the first report of the Commission was to the contrary; but to annul the Commission's order on this ground would be to substitute the judgment of a court for the judgment of the Commission upon a matter purely administrative, and this cannot be done. United States v. Louisville & Nashville R. R., \n235 \nU.S. 314, 320\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 113; Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 351, 361\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 370. The common use of the St. Louis Terminal by the fourteen trunk lines under a single arrangement as to absorption of the terminal charges does not, as matter of law, entitle the Railway which has no trunk line and does terminal switching alone, to precisely the same treatment. United States v. St. Louis Terminal, \n224 \nU.S. 383, 405\n, 406 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 507; Louisville & Nashville R. R. v. United States, \n242 U.S. 60\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 61.\n Criticism is directed to the somewhat abstruse distinction drawn by the Commission between allowances or absorptions made by trunk lines in compensation for services rendered to them and divisions out of joint rates as for services rendered for the shippers (28 I. C. C. 101-106; 32 I. C. C. 102); but we deem it unnecessary to discuss the point. See Tap Line Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 1, 28\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 741. United States v. Butler County R. R. Co., \n234 U.S. 29\n, 35-36, 34 Sup. Ct. 748; O'Keefe v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 294, 302\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 313.\n It hardly can have escaped attention that the real complaint \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 483]\n\u00a0\n of appellants respecting the order now under consideration is directed not to what the order requires to be done, but to what it does not require. It granted a part of the relief for which appellants had applied to the Commission. Recognizing the Railway as a common carrier to which allowances and divisions might be accorded by the trunk lines, and that through routes were in operation between the Railway and those lines, it fixed the maximum joint rates, and went no further for the present. The real ground for resorting to the courts in this case is the failure to fix divisions. In effect the District Court was asked to perform a function specifically conferred by law upon the Commission. But that court has only the same jurisdiction that formerly was vested in the Commerce Court (Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539; Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219); and it is settled that this does not permit the court to exercise administrative authority where the Commission has failed or refused to exercise it, or to annul orders of the Commission not amounting to an affirmative exercise of its powers. Procter & Gamble v. United States, \n225 U.S. 282\n, 292, et seq., 32 Sup. Ct. 761.\n Complaint is made because reparation was not awarded. But we are unable to see that proper foundation was laid for this in the evidence submitted to the Commission.\n Nothing more need be said concerning No. 25.\n The first question raised in No. 24 is based upon the language of the second paragraph of section 15 of the Commerce Act, inserted by the amendment of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 552.2 It is said that the tariff published by \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 484]\n\u00a0\n the Cotton Belt December 7, 1913, was a new tariff within the meaning of this provision, and while the Commission was authorized, either upon complaint or on its own initative, to suspend its operation pending a hearing, this suspension must not be for a longer perod than 120 days beyond the time when the tariff would otherwise go into effect unless the hearing could not be concluded within that period, in which case alone the Commission might extend the time of suspension of a further period not exceeding six months. It is contended that no hearing on the matters involved in the suspended tariff was begun within the 120 days, and therefore the second order of suspension, and also the order canceling this tariff, were arbitrary and unlawful; the argument being that the issues involved in I. C. C. Docket No. 3151 were not the same as those presented in the matter of the suspended tariff, I. & S. Docket No. 355, and hence there was no hearing whatever on the latter. \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 485]\n\u00a0\n The form of the orders made by the Commission in I. & S. Docket No. 355 lends color to this argument. The order of December 19, 1913, makes no reference to the proceedings then pending in I. C. C. Docket No. 3151, treats the tariff recently filed as 'stating new individual regulations and practices affecting rates and charges,' declares that the Commission will enter upon a hearing concerning their propriety, and directs that their operation be postponed until the seventh of May; while the order of April 20 refers to the former one, recites that 'such hearing cannot be concluded within the period of suspension above stated,' and orders a further suspension until the 7th of November.\n But it is not suggested, and there is no ground for supposing that the parties were misled by the form of these orders. They were parties to I. C. C. Docket No. 3151, then pending. The Cotton Belt was one of the carriers which had canceled the former tariffs authorizing allowances averaging $4.50 per car to the Railway, and the Railway having complained to the Commission of its action, it answered declaring among other things that it canceled the tariff for the reason that it was advised that the allowances theretofore made to the Railway were illegal because the Railway was merely an industrial or tap line and under the law not entitled to any part of the through rate, and further that if the Railway was entitled to compensation as a carrier it was not entitled to receive from the Cotton Belt any allowance out of the through rate, that if entitled to any it was not entitled to the allowance theretofore paid to it under the canceled tariff, and that the allowance given to the Railway was unreasonable, excessive, and unjust.\n The issues raised by this answer and by the answers of the other defendant trunk lines, which are briefly recited in the first report (21 I. C. C. 307) but need not be here repeated necessarily involved, and were treated by the \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 486]\n\u00a0\n Commission as involving, the question how uch could be allowed by the trunk lines to the Railway out of the through rate without amounting to an undue preference or indirect rebate to the Brewery because of the common control of the Brewery and the Railway. Special attention was called to this in the first report, as appears from what has been recited in the statement prefacing this opinion. And it is obvious that the same consideration was inherent in the case, whether the payments by the trunk lines to the Railway were considered as divisions of joint rates for services rendered for the shippers served by the Railway, or absorptions in compensation for services rendered by the Railway for the trunk lines. In either case, if the allowances to the Railway were made unduly large, the Brewery's share of the profit accruing from them would amount to an indirect preference to the Brewery. Tap Line Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 1, 28\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 741; O'Keefe v. United States, \n240 U.S. 294\n, 301- 302, 36 Sup. Ct. 313. Accordingly, in the second report (28 I. C. C. 107), the Commission said:\n'Complainant railway itself concedes that this question of the amount of the allowance to the Railway, but not the question of whether a reasonable allowance should be made, is a matter for closer investigation owing to the common ownership of the stock of the Railway and of the Brewery, its statement in this respect, however, being based of course upon the understanding that the allowance was to come from the trunk lines.'\n\n And in the concluding part of its report, the Commission stated (page 111):\n'Should one or more of the trunk lines attempt to pay to the Railway [ more than] the $2 per car which we suggest herein as being in our opinion reasonable for the latter's shippers to pay for its service, another question would be presented in which would figure the fact, much discussed in the record, of the common ownership of the stock of the Railway and of the Brewery. That question would not arise primarily under section 15 of the act, but under those sections- \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 487]\n\u00a0\n which seek to prohibit the giving of unlawful concessions by any device whatsoever. It follows from what we have said herein that we regard the present allowances which, as stated, average slightly above $4.50 per car, as effecting unlawful results.'\n\n This was on June 21, 1913; pursuant to the report the criticized allowances were canceled; and on November 13 in the same year the case was submitted to the Commission upon a rehearing at the instance of the Railway. The Cotton Belt remained a party to the proceeding. The issues raised by its answer had not been finally disposed of, nor its answer withdrawn. Since it involved the public interests, and not merely those of the Cotton Belt, this particular issue hardly could be withdrawn.\n The question of the validity of the previous allowances, approximately $4.50 per car, or of any allowance greater than $2 per car, being thus bound up in the pending controversy under I. C. C. Docket No. 3151, the Cotton Belt tariff published December 7, 1913, while the Commission had that controversy under advisement, manifestly was an attempt to forestall the decision. There was no error in suspending it pending the decision. And, there being nothing further to be submitted to the Commission in the way of evidence or argument, it was natural, and not inconsistent with the substantial rights of the parties, for the Commission to treat the suspension of the Cotton Belt tariff as a proceeding ancillary to the other, involving no different question on the merits.\n The final order setting this tariff aside necessarily rested upon a finding that the proposed absorption was was so unduly large as to amount to a preference or indirect rebate to the Brewery. In orders of this kind, not including an award of damages, formal and precise findings no longer are necessary; section 14 having been amended in this respect by Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584, 589. See House Report No. 591, 59th Congress, 1st Sess. p. 4, explaining this provision of the bill. \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 488]\n\u00a0\n What we have said disposes at the same tim of the only objection raised against the order of April 20, 1914.\n The Railway makes the additional contention that the order of July 10, 1914 (I. & S. Docket No. 355), prohibited the Cotton Belt from paying to the Railway as much as $4.50 per car for its services, and that it amounted to a taking of the Railway's property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment, because any rate less than that named would be confiscatory. That the order has the effect of prohibiting the Cotton Belt from paying to the Railway as much as $4.50 per car is alleged in the petition of the appellants and admitted in the answer of the United States, and we take it for granted that this is so. It is argued that it was operative upon all the trunk lines, and it is contended that payments by all of these lines upon all interstate car interchanges of any rate less than $4.50 per car would not yield in the aggregate a reasonable return upon the fair value of the Railway's property devoted to the use of interstate commerce.\n As a part of the argument, it is urged that the decision of the Commission actually limits the earnings of the Railway to $2.50 per car, alleged to be wholly inadequate. But the order under attack in this suit has no such effect; and the contemporaneous order under I. C. C. Docket No. 3151 merely limits the joint rates to not exceeding $2.50 in advance of the St. Louis rates, and does not deal with the divisions; the opinion expressed upon this point being only tentative.\n Appellees contend that the finding of the Commission upon the subject of confiscation is conclusive; or at least that it is not subject to be attacked upon the evidence not presented to the Commission, as is attempted here. We cannot sustain this objection in its entirety. It is true that so long as the Commission proceeds in accordance with the requirements of the Commerce Act and its amendments, and with proper regard for constitutional restrictions, its \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 489]\n\u00a0\n administrative orders, not calling for the payment of money, if made after due hearing and supported by evidence, are not subject to attack in the courts. This, as we have seen, results from the provisions of sections 15 and 16 of the act as amended. Interstate Comm. Comm. v. Illinois Central R. R., \n215 U.S. 452\n, 469-470, 30 Sup. Ct. 155; interstate Comm. Comm. v. Union Pacific R. R., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 108; Procter & Gamble v. United States, \n225 U.S. 282\n, 297-298, 32 Sup. Ct. 761; Interstate Comm. Comm. v. Louisville & Nash. R. R., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 185. But these cases recognize that matters of constitutioal right are not to be conclusively determined by the Commission; and we are not prepared to say that a party is debarred from attacking an order of the Commission upon constitutional grounds even though they were not taken in the hearing before that body.\n Nevertheless, correct practice requires that, in ordinary cases, and where the opportunity is open, all the pertinent evidence shall be submitted in the first instance to the Commission, and that a suit to set aside or annul its order shall be resorted to only where the Commission acts in disregard of the rights of the parties. This was recognized before the amendment of 1906, and when by sections 14, 15, and 16 of the original Act of February 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 384, as amended by Act of March 2, 1889, c. 382, 25 Stat. 855, the findings made by the Commission upon questions of fact were limited in their effect to that of prima facie evidence in all cases and not only, as now, in reparation cases. Concinnati, N. O. & Texas Pac. Ry. v. Interstate Comm. Comm., \n162 \nU.S. 184, 196\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 700; Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Interstate Comm. Comm., \n162 \nU.S. 197, 235\n, 238 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 666; Louisville, etc., R. R. Co. v. Behlmer, \n175 \nU.S. 648, 675\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 209; East Tennessee, etc., Ry. Co. v. Int rstate Comm. Comm., \n181 \nU.S. 1, 27\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 516; Illinois Central R. R. v. Interstate Comm. Comm., \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 700. The 1906 \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 490]\n\u00a0\n amendment, in modifying section 14 so as to dispense with the necessity of formal findings of fact except in cases where damages (or reparation) are awarded, and sections 15 and 16 so as to give a greater effect than before to the orders of the Commission other than those requiring the payment of money, renders it not less but more appropriate that, so far as practicable, all pertinent objections to action proposed by the Commission and the evidence to sustain them shall first be submitted to that body. Hence, we cannot approve of the course that was pursued in this case, of withholding from the Commission essential portions of the evidence that is alleged to show the rate in question to be confiscatory. Certainly, where the Commission, after full hearing, has set aside a given rate on the ground that it is unreasonably, high it sould require a clear case to justify a court, upon evidence newly adduced but not in a proper sense newly discovered, in annulling the action of the Commission upon the ground that the same rate is so unreasonably low as to deprive the carrier of its constitutional right of compensation.\n However, the issue is in the case and must be dealt with. In order to show that any rate less than $4.50 would be noncompensatory, the Railway undertook to demonstrate that the full $4.50 would not pay the cost of transportation and yield a just return upon the value of its property. Yet the rates voluntarily established by the Railway prior to the commencement of the present controversy averaged about $4.50 per car, a $4.50 rate was provided for in a tariff issued by the Railway in February, 1913, a uniform allowance of this amount was asked for by it upon the second hearing before the Commission, and the Railway concurred in, and now seeks to maintain, the Cotton Belt tariff which contemplated payment of that rate for its services. Besides, the rate may be compared with $3 per car charged by the Terminal for similar services, $2 per car fixed by city ordinance \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 491]\n\u00a0\n as the Railway's maximum charge for local shipments between any points on its line, the charge of $1 per car voluntarily established by the Railway for intra-plant movements, 25 cents per car for weighing movements, and the special charge of $1 per car on limited liability, obtaining between the Railway and the Cotton Belt and offered to other carriers. The evidential effect of the Railway's voluntary action is obvious. Interstate Comm. Comm. v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. R. Co., \n186 \nU.S. 320, 336\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 824.\n Moreover, upon the second hearing before the Commission (January, 1912), Mr. Moore, the President of the Railway, testifying in its behalf upon the very point and from a full knowledge of the operations of the company and its property and expense accounts, stated:\n'The revenue which we are now receiving for all kinds of service performed by the Manufacturers' Railway Company is sufficient to pay operating expenses, taxes, rentals, and other fixed charges and 7 per cent. on the investment.'\n\n The evidence produced by the Railway before the District Court, while quite inconsistent with these concessions, is adduced as a mathematical demonstration that the $4.50 rate is confiscatory. The principal witnesses were an expert in the valuation of railways, two real estate experts, and Mr. Moore, the President of the Railway. Opinion evidence was relied upon, basing values on estimated cost of reproduction less depreciation, it being stated that the records of the Railway had been kept in such a way as not to show the actual cost. A table was presented ('Summary D') stating the entire value of the property of the Railway on January 1, 1915, at $2,215,353.78, and deductions were made of capital expenditures during the previous eighteen months, in order to show the value as of June 30, 1913, and June 30, 19 4. It was attempted to assign to the interstate business a proportion of the total value corresponding to the extent \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 492]\n\u00a0\n of its employment in that business. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 461\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18. The value of the property as of June 30, 1913, according to the estimates, was $2,086,474.98; and it being found that the interstate car movements during the preceding fiscal year were 79.58 per cent. of the total traffic, an application of this percentage to the total value gave $ 1,659,227.08 as the proportion of the value of the property, based on use, assigned to interstate traffic for the fiscal year 1913. Operating expenses, taxes, and rentals for the same year were said to amount to $195, 628.80, of which 79.58 per cent., or $155,681.39, was apportioned to interstate business. The gross revenue from interstate business for the same year, on the assumed basis of $4.50 per car from all trunk lines on all car interchanges, was calculated to be $217,309.25. Deducting from this the apportioned expenses ($155,681.39) would leave a net revenue of $ 61,627.86, or only 3.7 per cent. of $1,659,227.08, the value of the property assigned on the basis of use to interstate traffic as of June 30, 1913.\n Similar processes showed apparent net earnings of only 1.86 per cent. for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1914, and .77 per cent. for the six months ending December 31, 1914.\n The calculations are complex, and we need not reproduce them in detail. We have indicated the outlines, and will analyze the figures only far enough to show that they do not amount to a demonstration.\n By way of contrast to the results deduced from opinion evidence concerning values, it should be remarked that Mr. Moore testified in the District Court that at the commencement of his connection with the company in February, 1909, he could only find an apparent book value amounting to $ 300,899.65, which he believed, however, did not reflect the value of the railway property at that time; and that down to January 31, 1915, there had been improvements and additions to the equipment \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 493]\n\u00a0\n amounting to $560,008.75, and additions to real estate amounting to $525, 349, making a total book value of $1,386,257.40. By deducting $128,878.80 for capital expenditures subsequent to June 30, 1913, we get $1,257,378.60 as the total value on that date, of which 79.58 per cent., or $1,000,621. 89, would represent the value assigned to the interstate business according to the formula; and upon this amount the calculated net revenue of $61,627.86 would yield over 6 per cent.\n Returning to the calculation relied upon by the Railway, Summary D includes an item 'Present Value of Leases, $757,102.'\n This is the sum of two items, explained as follows: The Railway holds under lease from the Brewery all the lands occupied by its tracks and certain tracks owned by the Brewery within what is described as the 'Brewery Zone,' bounded by Lynch Street on the north, First street on the east, Utah Street on the south, and Thirteenth Street on the west, the rental being $24,000 per annum, and the lease having seventeen years to run from January 1, 1915. The real estate experts valued this according to its area in square feet, and by this process arrived at $1,377,853 as its market value. The rental value on a 5 per cent. basis would be $68,892.65. Since by the terms of the lease the lessor was required to pay the taxes, estimated at about $6,000, reducing the net income to about $18,000, this sum was deducted from $68,892.65, leaving $50,892.65 as the annual value of the lease to the Railway for the unexpired term of seventeen years; and the cash value of an annuity of the amount for that term, said to be $573, 767, was taken as the capital value of the lease. \n3\n Again, the Railway \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 494]\n\u00a0\n holds certain property in its River Yard under lease from the City of St. Louis at an annual rental of $4,000, expiring October 7, 1934. This property was estimated by the witnesses to be worth $376,309, 5 per cent. of which is $18,815.45, and this amount less $4,000 was taken to be the annual value of the lease, which, capitalized for 19 years 9 months and 7 days, the unexpired term from January 1, 1915 (date of valuation), gave $ 183,335 as the value of this lease to the lessee.\n We are not convinced that these somewhat speculative valuations of the leaseholds, even if the calculations were otherwise correct, ought to be included in the value of the Railway's property for the present purpose.\n The lease from the Brewery includes sidings, tracks, and yards some of which are of special value to the Brewery, but either are inaccessible to the general public served by the tracks of the Railway or are practically monopolized for plant use by the Brewery. The Commission, in its Second Report, 28 I. C. C. 96, described the conditions. \n4\n The original lease from the Brewery to \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 495]\n\u00a0\n the Railway, dated December 31, 1908, drew a distinction between tracks and sidings, leasing the former and excluding the latter, as to which, however, it contained this clause:\n'Said Association further gives and grants to said Railway the right and privilege to use and operate the aforesaid sidings, for railway purposes, upon condition, however, that such use will never interfere with the reasonable use thereof by said Association, of which said Association shall be the sole and only judge.'\n\n This was made the subject of criticism at the first hearing before the Commission, and in consequence the lease was amended before the second hearing so as to omit this limitation (28 I. C. C. 97). But the evidence tends to show, if it does not render it clear, that certain years and tracks representing more than one-third of the aggregate value of the leased lands are used almost if not quite exclusively by the Brewery; and raises a question whether some of the other yards, or portions of them, are not, like those mentioned, actually used rather as parts of the Brewery plant than as parts of the transportation system of the Railway. \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 496]\n\u00a0\n The finding of the Commission that the 1 ailway is for the purposes of its decision a common carrier (a finding not now in question), does not have the necessary effect of impressing all of its property with the character of property employed in the service of the public. The Commission recognized that there was a question whether a part of the service performed by the Railway was not a plant-facility service rather than that of a common carrier. 21 I. C. C. 316. And under the peculiar circumstances of the case we prefer to accept the reserved rental of $24, 000, voluntarily fixed by the parties most concerned at a time antedating the present controversy, as more reliable evidence of the annual value of the rights conferred upon the Railway as a carrier than the opinions of the experts based upon the theory that by the lease the entire value of the property was devoted to the public use.\n The lease from the city to the Railway is not in the printed transcript, but the substance of the ordinance authorizing it is stated. It granted authority to construct, maintain, and operate tracks upon land of which a considerable part constituted a public wharf. If the stipulated rental is less than the fair annual value of the property it is to be presumed that the grant of the excess was to the public, not to the private interest of the Railway. We are at a loss to see upon what principle a presumed annual value of the leasehold in excess of the stipulated rent can be capitalized as assets of the Railway for the use of which in commerce the public is required to pay tolls. This would give to the lease the effect of converting public property, pro tanto, into private property.\n Deducting the value of leases, $757,102, from $2,086,474.98, the estimated value of the Railway's property as of June 30, 1913, would leave $ 1,329,372.98, of which 79.58 per cent., or $1,057,915.02, would represent the value assigned to the interstate business according to the \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 497]\n\u00a0\n formula; and upon this amount the calculated net revenue of $61,627.86 would yield over 5.8 per cent.\n The calculations of revenue and expenses also require revision. The gross revenue from interstate business as stated includes not merely that derived from car interchanges at $4.50 per car, of which in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913, there were 45,602 cars, producing $205,209; but in addition there was short-haul interchanges, 4,975 cars at the city rate of $2 per car, producing $9,950; interplant and intra-plant movements, 1, 206 cars at $1 per car, producing $1,206; and weighing movements, 3,777 cars at 25 cents, producing $944.25, making a total of $217,309.25. The evidence renders it clear that the cost of these different movements is not and cannot be segregated; and Mr. Moore himself testified in effect that it costs the same to the Railway to weigh a car upon which 25 cents revenue is received, as to make an intra-plant switch of a car for which $ 1 is received, or a city movement limited by ordinance to $2, or an interchange delivery for which $4.50 is the rate assumed for the purposes of the test. The plant movements are for the benefit of the Brewery alone, that being the only industry having need for such service; weighing movements likewise appear to be independent of transportation in commerce. The limit of $2 fixed by the ordinance for the city movements seems to have been a part of the consideration for the grant to the Railway of rights in the streets; and on this theory any deficiency of revenue is properly apportionable to the traffic participating in these movements. But as to the other movements, the method of calculation adopted apportions the cost between the different classes according to the revenue derived from each, rather than according to the cost or value of the service.\n If the plant and weighing movements-all of the former and three- fourths of the latter being performed for the Brewery-were charged at (say ) $2.50 per car instead of the \n\n[246 U.S. 457, 498]\n\u00a0\n rates voluntarily adopted, the gain of revenue would be more than $10,000- approximately 1 per cent. upon the entire $1,057,915.02.\n The evidence submitted upon the issue of confiscation suggests other questions that need not be discussed or even mentioned; but we must not be understood as accepting what we have not particularly criticized. It is sufficient to say there is a failure to prove that the rate is unremunerative.\n Decrees affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'At any hearing involving a rate increased after January first, nineteen hundred and ten, or of a rate sought to be increased after the passage of this act [June 18, 1910], the burden of proof to show that the increased rate or proposed increased rate is just and reasonable shall be upon the common carrier, and the commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over all other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Whenever there shall be filed with the Commission any schedule stating a new individual or joint rate, fare, or charge, or any new individual or joint classification, or any new individual or joint regulation or practice affecting any rate, fare, or charge, the Commission shall have, and it is hereby given, authority, either upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, at once, and if it so orders, without answer or other formal pleading by the interested carrier or carriers, but upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the properiety of such rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice; and pending such hearing and the decision thereon the Commision upon filing with such schedule and delivering to the carrier or carriers affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension may suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of such rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice, but not for a longer period than one hundred and twenty days beyond t e time when such rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice would otherwise go into effect; and after full hearing, whether completed before or after the rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice goes into effect, the Commission may make such order in reference to such rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after the rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice had become effective: Provided, that if any such hearing cannot be concluded within the period of suspension, as above stated, the Interstate Commerce Commission may, in its discretion, extend the time of suspension for a further period not exceeding six months.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The process is clearly erroneous. Payment of taxes by lessor is for its own account, not for lessee's. Annual cost of leasehold to lessee is measured by gross rental paid, irrespective of what lessor does with the money. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The squares bounded by the streets Ninth, Thirteenth, Lynch, and Dorcas; Ninth, Eleventh, Pestalozzi, and Arsenal; and Second, Broadway ( Broadway being just south of Seventh) Pestalozzi, and Arsenal are devoted to buildings and yards of the Brewery exclusively. Although within these bounded areas there are also others in addition to the three follow-named departments, they will, for the sake of convenience, be referred to as the bottling department, Budweiser department, and keg department, respectively. The tracks serving all three of these departments are in and between buildings and sheds of the Brewery or in the yards adjoining, and are practically inclosed-on some sides by buildings with passageways between and on the other sides by fences or walls surrounding the yards contiguous to the buildings. All of the tracks within these yards are essential to the operation of the Brewery except four team tracks in the yards contiguous to the bottling department at Ninth and Dorcas. As bearing upon the accessibility by the public to these various departments, it may be explained that the tracks in the open yard of the bottling department-that is, on the Ninth and Dorcas street sides-are inclosed by an iron fence, on which are displayed 'No Thoroughfare' signs, and that the four public team tracks in this yard, referred to, end on the edge of an embankment supported by a concrete wall built up from Ninth Street, which is some 10 or 12 feet below, and topped with an iron fence; that the tracks at the Thirteenth street side of his department are ended some 10 or 15 feet below the street level by a stone wall and must therefore be reached by entries from other sides; that the team tracks in the Budweiser yard at Ninth and Pestalozzi are inclosed by a high iron fence with swinging gates; and, likewise, that the 25 or more ladder tracks in the yards of the keg department, beginning at Second and Pestalozzi and running west to Broadway, are ended some 25 feet below the level of Broadway by an embankment which is re-enforced by a concrete or stone wall topped with an iron fence. As access w the latter department from the Broadway side is thus absolutely impracticable, entrance must be effected from Pestalozzi street or between buildings of the Brewery on the Arsenal street side between Second and Broadway. \n\n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARCONI WIRELESS TEL. CO. OF AMERICA v. SIMON(1918)\nNo. 168\nArgued: January 29, 1918Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 46, 47]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. L. F. H. Betts, John W. Griggs, Richard A. Ford, and James R. Sheffield, all of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 46, 50]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter H. Pumphrey, Zell G. Roe and Harry Lea Dodson, all of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 46, 53]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the spring or early summer of 1915 the Navy Department submitted its call for proposals to furnish 25 wireless telegraph transmitting sets. The call contained a specification describing the apparatus desired and provided that no bid would be entertained unless the bidder in advance or at the time of his bid submitted a sample of the apparatus which he would furnish under his bid if accepted. Simon, the respondent, who had no manufacturing establishment, employed a manufacturer of electrical apparatus to make for him a wireless telegraph transmitting set and when it was made submitted it to the Navy Department in accordance with the call. He also submitted a bid to furnish the appliances called for conformably to the sample and his bid was accepted by the Navy Department in August, 1915. Before the contract, however, was formally completed, in September following the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, the petitioner, as assignee of the Marconi patents on apparatus for wireless telegraphy, filed its bill against Simon seeking an injunction preventing him from making or delivering the apparatus described in his bid on the ground that his doing so would be an infringement of the rights secured by the Marconi patents. The complainant moved for a preliminary injunction in accordance with the prayer of the bill, supporting its motion by affidavits, and the \n\n[246 U.S. 46, 54]\n\u00a0\n defendant made a counter motion to dismiss the bill, the motion not being in the record but the ground thereof being persuasively shown by an affidavit submitted in its support, as well as by the reasons given by the court when it came to pass upon the motion. The ground stated in the affidavit was as follows:\n'That affiant, in supplying the United States navy with wireless sets constructed in accordance with Navy specifications in the present instance for use on submarines, understood that he would be free of any and all liability for profits and damages for alleged infringement of patents, in view of the law as established by many recent decisions of the United States courts holding that the government, in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, may impose a license on any patent, the subject-matter of which it elects to use, and if the apparatus supplied by affiant to the Navy comes within the claims of the patent in suit, affiant has only assisted the government, a licensee, in carrying out its license.'\n\n On the hearing of the motions there was contention as to whether the transmitting sets furnished by Simon were merely an indirect or contributory infringement of the Marconi patents because they were not comple e and could not become so until they were adjusted for use and used by the Navy Department, or whether they were so complete without reference to such subsequent adjustment and use as to be a direct infringement. In passing at the same time upon the motion for injunction and the motion to dismiss the bill, the court, not doubting that the bill and the affidavits supporting the motion for an injunction established that the making and furnishing of the apparatus by Simon in an abstract sense infringed the Marconi patents either directly or indirectly by contribution, did not find it necessary to determine which one of the two characters of infringement had resulted because it concluded that such determination in the con- \n\n[246 U.S. 46, 55]\n\u00a0\n crete was wholly irrelevant as under the view taken of the case in any aspect there was no unlawful infringement. This conclusion was reached by considering the Act of 1910 (Act June 25, 1910, c. 423, 36 Stat. 851 [Comp. St. 1916,  9465]) in connection with the decision in Crozier v. Krupp, \n224 U.S. 290\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 488, and by holding that from such considerations it resulted that there existed in favor of the United States a general license to use patent rights when necessary for its governmental purposes and that Simon, as a contractor or one proposing to contract with the United States, could avail himself of the license right in favor of the United States and therefore was entitled to make and deliver the articles in question for the United States although if such license had not existed, the doing so would be either a direct or contributory infringement. The order as to both the injunction and the motion to dismiss were as follows:\n'No injunction will issue. The motion to dismiss is granted, unless plaintiff elects in 20 days to plead over, and allege infringements not arising from governmental contracts. If such election is made, defendant to answer in twenty days after amended bill filed.' (D. C.) 227 Fed. 906.\n\n The complainant having refused to make the election and to amend, a decree of dismissal was subsequently entered which was reviewed by the court below. That court while it affirmed upon the theory of the license resulting from the act of 1910 in accordance with the views which had been expressed by the trial court, also treated the act of Simon as either an infringement per se or a contribution to the infringement, if any, resulting from the acts of the United States, and did not distinguish between them doubtless because of a belief that under the construction given to the act of 1910 both were negligible and afforded no ground for complaint. 231 Fed. 1021, 145 C. C. A. 656. By virtue of the allowance of a writ of certiorari the case is now before us. \n\n[246 U.S. 46, 56]\n\u00a0\n In view of the construction which we have given the act of 1910 in the case of William Cramp & Sons Co. v. International Curtis Marine Turbine Co., \n246 U.S. 28\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 271, 62 L. Ed. --, just decided, it is apparent that both the courts below erred since the significance which they gave to the statute and upon which their conclusions were based, we have held in the case stated to be without foundation. It would hence follow, looking at this case from a generic point of view, that our duty would be to reverse the action of both courts below and to decide the controversy on the merits in the light of the construction of the statute which we have announced. But we are of opinion that under the case as made by the record the duty of applying to the issues the true meaning of the statute cannot with safety or with due regard to the rights of the parties be now performed because of the failure of the courts below (a failure obviously resulting from the mistaken view they took of the statute) to determine whether the acts of Simon in furnishing the wireless apparatus amounted to an intrinsic or per se infringement, or only constituted contributions to the infringement, if any, resulting from the adjustment and use of the apparatus by the United States or its essential governmental purposes. We are compelled to this conclusion because if the making of the parts was in and of itself an infringement, it is clear under the ruling which we have just made in the Cramp Case that Simon was not protected by the supposition of a license resulting from the act of 1910 and that his acts were none the less wrongful because committed in the course of the performance of a contract with the United States. And if on the other hand they were only contributions to an infringement resulting from the acts of the United States, it is equally clear that in view of the provisions of the act of 1910 as interpreted in the Cramp Case and as upheld and applied in the Crozier Case, no illegal interference with the rights of the patentee arose or could arise \n\n[246 U.S. 46, 57]\n\u00a0\n from the mere furnishing to the government of the United States of the parts which were not per se infringements oven although the use by the United States would infringe the patents.\n If follows therefore that to finally decide the case would require us to determine whether or not the apparatus as furnished was a direct infringement or mere contribution. But to do this would call for the exercise on our part of a duty which it was the province of the court below to perform and which doubtless it would have performed but for the error into which it fell concernng the interpretation of the act of 1910 and the application to the subject which was before it of the prior decision of this court in Crozier v. Krupp, supra. Under these circumstances, as we have clearly removed by our decision in the Cramp Case all reasons for misconception concerning the statute and have thus cleared the way for the discharge by the court below of its duty, we think the case before us comes directly within the spirit of the ruling in Lutcher & Moore Lumber Co. v. Knight, \n217 U.S. 257\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 505, United States v. Rimer, \n220 U.S. 547\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 596, William Cramp & Sons Co. v. International Curtis Marine Turbine Co., \n228 U.S. 645\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 722, and Brown v. Fletcher, \n237 U.S. 583\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 750. We do not overlook, in saying this, contentions advanced in argument that as the devices may have been made by Simon not only for the government but for other persons, and even those furnished the government were made before the contract with the Navy Department was completed, therefore his act in making them was a direct infringement. We do not, however, stop to dispose of them since we are of opinion that under the state of the record we ought not to do so but should leave them also to be considered for what they are worth by the court below, if duly presented and relied upon, when it comes hereafter to consider the controversy.\n Our order therefore will be one reversing the decrees of \n\n[246 U.S. 46, 58]\n\u00a0\n both courts below and remanding to the District Court to the end that in the light of the construction which we have given the act of 1910 the rights of the parties may be considered and determined.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA dissents. \n\n\n\n","98":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARIN v. AUGEDAHL(1918)\nNo. 227\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 142, 143]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward Engerud, of Fargo, N. D., and Mr. Arthur A. Miller, of Crookston, Minn., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Emerson H. Smith, of Fargo. N. D., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[247 U.S. 142, 144]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action at law in North Dakota by a receiver of an insolvent Minnesota corporation to enforce against one of its stockholders an order of a Minnesota court laying an assessment on the stockholders generally. The defendant prevailed because the North Dakota court was of opinion that the order laying the assessment was made in the absence of such jurisdiction as was essential to bind him (32 N. D. 536, 156 N. W. 101), and the question for decision here is whether that court gave to the laws and proceedings in Minnesota the full faith and credit to which they are entitled under the Constitution and laws of the United States. See Great Western Telegraph Co. v. Purdy, \n162 U.S. 329\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 810; Tilt v. Kelsey, \n207 \nU.S. 43, 51\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 1.\n Under the law of Minnesota, where an execution on a \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 145]\n\u00a0\n judgment against a corporation of that state is returned unsatisfied, the court, in a suit by the judgment creditor, may sequestrate the property of the corporation, appoint a receiver of the same, cause the property to be sold and apply the proceeds to the payment of the receivership expenses and the corporate debts. And where in such a suit the receiver presents a petition asserting that 'any constitutional, statutory or other liability of stockholders' exists, and that resort thereto is necessary, the court must appoint a time for a hearing on the petition and cause such notice thereof as it deems proper to be given by publication or otherwise. If from the evidence presented at the hearing, including such as may be produced by any creditor or stockholder appearing in person or by attorney, it appears that there is a liability of stockholders and that the available assets are not sufficient to pay the expenses and debts, the court is required to make an order ratably assessing the stockholders on account of such liability and to direct that the assessment be paid to the receiver. If payment be not made, the duty is laid on the receiver of enforcing the same by actions against the defaulting stockholders, 'whether resident or noresident, and wherever found.' The court's order is expressly made 'conclusive as to all matters relating to the amount, propriety, and necessity of the assessment.' Rev. Laws 1905,  3173, 3184- 3187\n\n\n According to a settled line of local decisions the proceeding on the receiver's petition for an assessment on the stockholders is not an independent suit, but simply a step in the original sequestration suit ( Ueland v. Haugan, 70 Minn. 349, 73 N. W. 69) and the conclusive effect of the court's order is not dependent on the personal presence of the stockholders, because they are so far in privity with the corporation as to be represented by it, and a judgment against it is in effect a judgment against them (Hanson v. Davison, 73 Minn. 454, 462, 76 N. W. 254; Town of Hinckley v. \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 146]\n\u00a0\n Kettle River R. R. Co., 80 Minn. 32, 39, 82 N. W. 1088. But while the order is conclusive 'as to all matters relating to the amount, propriety and necessity of the assessment'-matters which concern all stockholders alike-it leaves open the questions whether a particular person is a stockholder or holds the number of shares attributed to him, whether he has discharged his liability or has a claim which may be set off against the assessment, and whether he has any other defense which is 'personal to himself.' Straw & Ellsworth Co. v. Kilbourne Co., 80 Minn. 125, 136, 83 N. W. 36.\n As so applied, the Minnesota law has been sustained by this court against various claims that as to stockholders it infringes the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and we have also recognized and enforced the duty of courts of other states, under the due faith and credit clause of the Constitution and the legislation of Congress on that subject, to give effect to orders of Minnesota courts making assessments under that law, although the stockholders were not personally made parties to the suits wherein the orders were made. Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 U.S. 516\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 755; Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 U.S. 243\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292; Selig v. Hamilton, \n234 U.S. 652\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 926, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 104. And see Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 U.S. 531\n, 543-545, 35 Sup. Ct. 724, L. R. A. 1916A, 771.\n The order with which we here are concerned was made by a Minnesota court in a sequestration suit against a Minnesota corporation. Besides being a court of general jurisdiction, both at law and in equity, the court making the order had full jurisdiction of that suit. The suit was begun by a judgment creditor after an execution on his judgment was returned unsatisfied. The defendant corporation had its principal place of business in the county where the suit was begun, and was brought into the suit by due service of process. Thus much is not questioned. Nor is it questioned that a receiver was appointed, or that by a petition in the suit he sought an \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 147]\n\u00a0\n assessment on the stockholders, or that public notice of the hearing on the petition was given as the court directed, or that there was a hearing as contemplated. But it is insisted that the court was without jurisdiction to make the assessment and that in consequence the order is open to collateral attack. In support of this contention it is said that in making the assessement the court evidently proceeded on the mistaken assumption that the corporation was one on whose stockholders a liability was imposed by section 3 of article 10 of the state Constitution,1 whereas in truth the corporation was one of a class whose stockholders were excepted from the operation of that provision. But is this anything other than saying that the court erred in ruling on a matter of substantive law regularly presented to it for decision in a pending suit? The constitutional provision does no more than to declare a general rule of liability and to except therefrom stockholders of a certain class of corporations. It does not purport to deal with the jurisdiction of courts- their power to hear and determine-but only to prescribe in a general way the relative rights of stockholders and creditors. It therefore must be taken as going to the merits rather than to the jurisdiction. The Minnesota courts evidently so regard it; and they also treat the question whether a particular corporation belongs to one class or another as a matter the decision of which in a suit against the corporation is binding on the stockholders in subsequent litigation with the latter. Merchants' National Bank v. Minnesota Thresher Manufacturing Co., 90 Minn. 144, 149, 95 N. W. 767.\n Four Minnesota cases are cited as making against these views, but we do not so understand them. In Dwinnell v. Kramer, 87 Minn. 392, 92 N. W. 227, a policy holder in an in- \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 148]\n\u00a0\n solvent mutual fire insurance company, against whom a general assessment on the policy holders was sought to be enforced, successfully defended on the ground that his policy did not conform to the mutual plan, but was an 'ordinary contract of insurance' issued on receipt of a cash premium. The defense plainly was personal to him. Swing v. Humbird, 94 Minn. 1, 101 N. W. 938, arose under an Ohio law and not the law of Minnesota. An assessment made in Ohio on the policy holders of an insolvent fire insurance company was sought to be enforced in Minnesota, and the defendant prevailed because his policy had been fully paid for and had terminated prior to the assessment. That also was a personal defense. In Swing v. Red River Lumber Co., 105 Minn. 336, 117 N. W. 442, an attempt was made to enforce a similar Ohio assessment, but it failed for the reason, among others, that when the defendant's policy was issued the insurance company was doing business in Minnesota in violation of the laws of that state-a matter which was personal to him and to other Minnesota policy holders if there were such. In Finch, Van Slyck & McConville v. Vanasek, 132 Minn. 9, 155 N. W. 754, there was a direct appeal from an order levying an assessment on stockholders in a sequestration suit. The character of the corporation was not in controversy, and the 'only controverted question before the [trial] court was the amount to be levied.' There also was a question in the appellate court as to whether the trial should have been to a jury. With this in mind, it seems plain that what was said can have no particular bearing here.\n Had the Minnesota court in this instance held that the corporation was in the excepted class and then denied the receiver's petition, is it not certain that the order, if neither vacated nor reversed, would have settled conclusively the nonexistence of the asserted liability? And if in a subsequent suit the receiver or the creditors represented by him had again asserted such a liability on the part of \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 149]\n\u00a0\n the stockholders, is there any doubt that the latter could have relied safely on the order as a prior adjudication in their favor? The answers seem obvious. Charged with the duty, as the court was, of ascertaining whether there was any liability to be enforced, it was its province to consider and decide every question which was an element in that problem, including the one of whether the corporation was in the excepted class. That question required solution and the power to solve it was lodged in the court. The court did solve it, for, as is said in Neff v. Lamm, 99 Minn. 115, 117, 108 N. W. 849, 850, the order making the assessment is 'necessarily based upon a determination that the corporation is of the class whose stock is assessable, and not of the excepted class.' Whether the decision was right or wrong is not open to discussion here. If wrong it was subject to correction on proper application to the court which made it, or on appeal, but it was not void or open to collateral attack. Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, \n191 \nU.S. 499, 510\n, 512 S., 24 Sup. Ct. 154; Noble v. Union River Logging R. R. Co., \n147 U.S. 165\n, 172-174, 13 Sup. Ct. 271; Dowell v. Applegate, \n152 \nU.S. 327, 340\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 611; In re First National Bank, 152 Fed. 64, 68- 70, 81 C. C. A. 260, 11 Ann. Cas. 355. Of course, it was the duty of the court to have due regard for the exception in the constitutional provision because of its bearing on the merits; and if proper effect was not given to it an error of law was committed, but nothing more. The true view of the subject is indicated in the following excerpts from our opinion in Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 234\n, 237 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 641, 642 (52 L. Ed. 1039):\n'No doubt it sometimes may be difficult to decide whether certain words in a statute are directed to jurisdiction or to merits, but the distinction between the two is plain. One goes to the power, the other only to the duty of the court. Under the common law it is the duty of a court of general jurisdiction not to enter a judgment upon a parol promise made without consideration; but it has power to do it, and, if it does, the judgment is unimpeacha- \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 150]\n\u00a0\n ble, unless reversed. Yet a statute could be framed that would make the power, that is, the jurisdiction of the court dependent upon whether there was a consideration or not. Whether a given statute is intended simply to establish a rule of substantive law, and thus to define the duty of the court, or is meant to limit its power, is a question of construction and common sense. When it affects a court of general jurisdiction and deals with a matter upon which that court must pass, we naturally are slow to read ambiguous words, as meaning to leave the judgment open to dispute, or as intended to do more than to fix the rule by which the court should decide.'\n\n'A judgment is conclusive as to all the media concludendi, United States v. California & Oregon Land Co., \n192 U.S. 355\n [24 Sup. Ct. 266] and it needs no authority to show that it cannot be impeached either in or out of the state by showing that it was based upon a mistake of law.'\n\n Whether the stockholder against whom the order is here sought to be enforced was personally a party to the suit in which it was made does not appear; nor is it material. Under the rule in Minnesota, as also the general rule, he was sufficiently represented by the corporation to be bound by the order in so far as it determined the character and insolvency of the corporation and other matters affecting the propriety of a general assessment such as was made. This court frequently has recognized and applied that rule. In Hawkins v. Glenn, \n131 U.S. 319\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 739, an assessment ordered by a Virginia court having the corporation before it was sustained as against stockholders residing in another state and not personally brought into the suit, the ground of decision being that 'a stockholder is so far an integral part of the corporation that, in the view of the law, he is privy to the proceedings touching the body of which he is a member.' Of similar import are Sanger v. Upton. \n91 U.S. 56\n; Glenn v. Liggett, \n135 U.S. 533\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 867; Great Western Telegraph Co. v. Purdy, 162 \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 151]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 329, 336, 16 Sup. Ct. 810; Hancock National Bank v. Farnum, \n176 U.S. 640\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 506; Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516, 532\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 755; Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 \nU.S. 531, 544\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 724, L. R. A. 1916A, 771.\n No doubt the order might be attacked collaterally by showing an absence of jurisdiction of person or subject-matter. The cases of Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457, and National Exchange Bank v. Wiley, \n195 U.S. 257\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 70, hold nothing more. Neither gives any warrant for saying that the order may be attacked collaterally by showing that error was committed in deciding the merits. One dealt with a judgment by a court having no jurisdiction whatever over the subject-matter, and the other dealt with a personal judgment rendered without service of process or personal appearance, but confessed under a warrant of attorney which did not cover it-in other words, a judgment rendered without jurisdiction of the person through a representative or otherwise. Both are inapposite here. By the law of its organization the Minnesota court was empowered to take cognizance of, hear nd determine, the suit to sequestrate and the receiver's petition for an assessment. Thus it had jurisdiction of the subject-matter. Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308, 316. The corporation was before it in virtue of process duly served, and the stockholders, as has been said, were represented by the corporation. Thus there was jurisdiction of the person.\n Under these circumstances, the order is entitled, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, to the same faith and credit in the courts of North Dakota as by law or usage are given to such an order in the courts of Minnesota. Hancock National Bank v. Farnum, \n176 U.S. 640\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 506; Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 U.S. 243\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292. In Minnesota, as before said, it is conclusive of all matters relating to the propriety of the assessment, including the questions of the character and insolvency of the corporation, and therefore it should have been held similarly \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 152]\n\u00a0\n conclusive in North Dakota. The court of that state declined to regard it as determining the character of the corporation, and so failed to give it the faith and credit to which it is entitled.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n The importance of the question involved in this case leads me to state somewhat fully my reasons for dissenting from the decision of the court.\n The plaintiff in error, as receiver of the American Biscuit Company of Crookston, an insolvent corporation, organized under the laws of the state of Minnesota, instituted suit in a district court of North Dakota against the defendant in error, a stockholder in the company, to recover upon an order, treated in the record as a judgment, entered by, an inferior, a district court of the state of Minnesota, which is described in the amended complaint as follows:\n'The said court ... made an order in said proceedings ordering and assessing against each and every share of the capital stock of said American Biscuit Company of Crookston the sum of one hundred dollars ($ 100) and against the persons and parties liable as such stockholders ... and further ordering that each and every party or person liable as such stockholder pay to this plaintiff as receiver of said insolvent corporation the sum of one hundred dollars ($100) for each and every share of stock on which he should be liable,' etc.\n\n It is further alleged that the defendant is the owner of one share of stock of the said company of the par value of $100 and that he has not paid to the court the assessment made.\n The complaint sets out in detail the statutes under which the Minnesota court proceeded and alleges that the Biscuit Company-- \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 153]\n\u00a0\n 'by its articles of incorporation was empowered to manufacture and sell biscuits, crackers, candies, confections, cereals, and other kindred products or supplies [necessary] or component parts thereof, and ['to purchase or own' probably omitted] the machinery, fixtures, equipment and supplies necessary for the manufacturing and dealing in the same ... and to maintain and operate stores and depots for the sale and disposal of its products and the purchase of its supplies, and in general to do and perform all matters and things necessary and proper in the successful conducting of the said business.'\n The district court of North Dakota sustained a demurrer to the complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and its judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state.\n The Constitution of Minnesota in effect at the time of the transactions involved in the case contains the following provision:\n Article 10, section 3: 'Each stockholder in any corporation, excepting those organized for the purpose of carrying on any kind of manufacturing or mechanical business, shall be liable to the amount of stock held or owned by him.'\n It is admitted that this is the only warrant for the Minnesota order, which was for the a ount of the personal or double liability of stockholders.\n The theory on which the North Dakota courts proceeded was that the complaint showed that the Biscuit Company was a manufacturing corporation such that no double liability could attach to its stockholders, and that therefore the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction, under the Constitution and laws of that state, to enter an order which precluded the defendant from showing that he was not, and could not be, liable to a valid double liability assessment.\n The distinction between provisions of law which are \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 154]\n\u00a0\n jurisdictional and those which are not, has not been, perhaps cannot be, made the subject of hard and fast definition. A much quoted statement is that the distinction, while difficult of application, is between 'a rule of law for the guidance of the court and a limit set to its power.' Interstate Commerce Commission v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., \n216 \nU.S. 538, 544\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 417; Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 235\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 641.\n In the opinion of the court it is said that the district court which entered the order sued on is a court of general jurisdiction. As a general statement this may be accepted, but when that court entered the order we are here considering it was not acting as a court of general jurisdiction, but-as we shall see, from the decisions of the Supreme Court of Minnesota- as a statutory court of narrowly limited powers, authorized to enter orders 'conclusive' in specifically defined respects. As a court of general jurisdiction, and independent of the statute under which the court was acting, its receiver could not have maintained this action in North Dakota. Hale v. Allinson, \n188 U.S. 56\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 244.\n In the case at bar we are dealing with a constitutional provision, obviously intended for the encouragement of manufactures in the state of Minnesota, which places it beyond the power of the Legislature to attach double liability to holders of stock in any manufacturing corporation organized under the laws of that state.\n Shall it be said that this, clearly a limitation on the power of the Legislature, is not also a limitation on the power of the Minnesota courts? That it is a jurisdictional limitation upon the Legislature but was only a rule for the guidance of the court, the jurisdiction of which, when entering the order involved, was determined by the act of the Legislature? It is not merely a rule to guide courts in determining whether stockholders in manufacturing corporations are subject to double liability, for it prohibits both the Legislature and the courts from imposing such \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 155]\n\u00a0\n liability upon stockholders in such corporations under any circumstances and is therefor a limitation upon the power of courts as certainly as it is a limitation on legislative power.\n The validity, in a proper case, of such an order as was entered by the Minnesota court, and the right of such a receiver to maintain a suit upon it in a foreign state to collect from stockholders resident therein, have both been sustained by this court. Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 U.S. 516\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 755; Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 U.S. 243\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292. But in each of these cases it was expressly found that the insolvent company was within the general terms of section 3, art. 10, of the Minnesota Constitution, and that therefore personal liability attached to its stockholders.\n Notwithstanding this fact, the defendant in error contends that the Minnesota court was without jurisdiction to render the order sued upon, and argues in substance as follows:\n\n\n (1)\n That the Minnesota court had authority to render such a 'judgment' only as against stockholders in other than corporations organized for manufacturing or mechanical business.\n This is not contested by the plaintiff in error in argument, but the answer to it, relied upon, is that the first question confronting the Minnesota court hearing the petition of creditors for the assessment was whether the Biscuit Company was a corporation whose stockholders were subject to double liability; that the order making the assessment could have been rendered only upon a holding that it was such a corporation; and that such an order, not appealed from, is conclusive as to this question, upon all stockholders.\n\n\n (2)\n That the character of the corporation as pleaded shows it to have been a manufacturing company, that therefore no personal liability attached to its stockholders and that thereby the Minnesota court is shown to have \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 156]\n\u00a0\n been without jurisdiction to render the 'judgment' sued upon.\n This contention also is not contested by the plaintiff in error, who contents himself, again, with relying upon the implication springing from the rendering of the Minnesota order.\n It seems clear enough that a corporation 'empowered to manufacture and sell biscuits, crackers, candy, etc., and to own and use the machinery, fixtures, equipment, and supplies necessary for the manufacturing and dealing in the same' must be classed as one 'organized for the purpose of carrying on' a 'manufacturing business.'\n But the Supreme Court of Minnesota has placed this conclusion beyond discussion.\n In Senour Mfg. Co. v. Church Paint Mfg. Co., 81 Minn. 294, 84 N. W. 109, it is held:\n'In proceedings to enforce the personal liability of stockholders for the debts of the corporation, the articles of association are the sole criterion as to the purposes for which the corporation was formed.'\n\n And corporations organized for purposes stated as follows have been held by that court to be manufacturing corporations such that they came within the constitutional exception, so that personal liability did not attach to holders of stock in them, viz., companies organized for:\n'The manufacture of painters' materials and supplies,' Senour Case, supra; 'for the manufacturing or brewing of lager beer, and selling and disposing of same,' Hastings Malting Co. v. Iron Range Brewing Co ., 65 Minn. 28, 67 N. W. 652; 'for the manufacture of cloth of every description and the sale of cloth so manufactured,' Nicollet National Bank v. Frisk-Turner Co., 71 Minn. 413, 74 N. W. 160, 70 Am. St. Rep. 334; 'to produce and create water, steam and other motive power for transmission and use as may be desirable for any legitimate purpose,' Cuyler v. City Power Co., 74 Minn. 22, 76 N. W. 948; 'for the purpose of generating electricity for distribution \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 157]\n\u00a0\n to the public,' Vencedor Investment Co. v. Highland Canal & Power Co., 125 Minn. 20, 145 N. W. 611.\n\n The test prescribed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota is, whether the entire business which the corporation is authorized to engage in is manufacturing and disposing of its products and such incidental business as may reasonably be necessary for the purposes of its organization. Hastings Malting Co. v. Iron Range Brewing Co., 65 Minn. 28, 31, 67 N. W. 652. Again, and obviously, in Nicollet National Bank v. Frisk-Turner Co., 71 Minn. 413, 74 N. W. 160, 70 Am. St. Rep. 334, it was held that the buying of raw materials and the selling of manufactured products are within the scope of the incidental powers of a manufacturing corporation, and do not constitute doing business other than the manufacturing business authorized. Clearly the Biscuit Company meets the constitutional requirement thus interpreted.\n The difference between the case at bar and the Bernheimer and Converse Cases, supra, is manifest and fundamental. These two cases were concerned with the affairs of the same corporation, and the Supreme Court of Minnesota held that on their face the articles of incorporation of the company provided for the purchase of the capital stock, evidences of indebtedness and assets of another corporation and also for a manufacturing purpose; that the former business was not incidental to the latter and that, therefore, the company not being organized exclusively for a manufacturing purpose, did not come within the constitutio al exception and that the personal liability attached to the stockholders. With this conclusion this court expressed itself satisfied in both cases.\n The question remains whether in the proceeding in which the order relied upon was entered, the Minnesota court had jurisdiction to render and actually did render an order such that a stockholder when sued upon it, either in Minnesota or in another state, would not have open to him the defense that the insolvent corporation was of \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 158]\n\u00a0\n such character that double liability did not attach to the owners of its stock.\n That the court did not have such jurisdiction and did not enter such an order in this case seems to me clear for the reasons following, viz.:\n In Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457, a decision obviously 'rendered on great consideration,' prior decisions dealing with the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution were carefully reviewed, and it was there decided that when the question of jurisdiction is appropriately presented the record of a judgment rendered may, constitutionally, be assailed in a collateral proceeding to enforce it in another state, even as to facts therein stated to have been passed upon by the court. This decision has been repeatedly affirmed and followed, and in National Exchange Bank v. Wiley, \n195 U.S. 257\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 70, it was accepted as authority sufficient for holding that a judgment by confession under warrant of attorney could be collaterally attacked in a foreign state by showing that the plaintiff in whose favor it was rendered in an Ohio court of general jurisdiction was not the owner of the note in suit at the time, and that the court entering it was, therefore, without jurisdiction, although the rendering of the judgment involved, or implied, the finding that the plaintiff was then the owner of the note.\n These authorities will suffice to illustrate the scope of the established rule that a judgment sued on in a foreign state may be shown in defense to have been entered by the court rendering it without jurisdiction, regardless of the form which such judgment make take on.\n With this rule in mind let us examine the character and scope of the 'order' sued upon in this case.\n The order was entered in a special statutory proceeding of a character such that the Supreme Court of Minnesota has declared that it is intended to be 'summary and without formal pleadings and not controlled by all the forms \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 159]\n\u00a0\n usually incident to judicial procedure' (132 Minn. 9, 12, 155 N. W. 754); the hearing in such cases is upon 'such notice as it [the court] deems proper' by publication or otherwise to be given'; upon the hearing the court 'shall receive and consider such evidence by affidavit or otherwise as may be presented by the receiver, or by any creditor, officer or stockholder appearing in person or by attorney'; and the statute expressly provides that:\n'Such order shall be conclusive as to all matters relating to the amount, propriety and necessity of the assessment, against all parties therein adjudged liable upon, or on account of, any stock or shares of such corporation, whether appearing or being represented at the hearing or not or having notice thereof or not.' Chapter 272,  5, General Laws of Minn. 1899.\n\n That the conclusive character of the order entered in such a proceeding has been strictly confined by the Minnesota Supreme Court to the respects in which the statute just quoted declares it shall be conclusive, leaving all other defenses open to the stockholder, is shown by the following decisions:\n The act in force when the order now under discussion was entered was passed in 1899 and in the following year the Supreme Court of Minnesota sustained its constitutionality in Straw & Ellsworth Manufacturing Co. v. L. D. Kilbourne Boot & Shoe Co., 80 Minn. 125, 83 N. W. 36, a case cited with approval by this court in both the Bernheimer and Converse Cases, supra. It was there held as follows:\n'Although the court inquires nto the amount of the liabilities as well as to what will probably be realized out of the assets, its sole determination is that it is necessary and proper that an assessment of a given amount shall be levied against each share of stock. That, and that only, is the ultimate issuable fact to be found by the court.\n\n'The plain purport of sections 3 and 5 is that after an \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 160]\n\u00a0\n order of assessment has been duly made, and the receiver has sued an alleged stockholder to recover upon the assessment, the order cannot be attacked in that action upon the ground that the assessment was unnecessary or excessive, or upon the ground that the defendant was not actually [made] a party to, or personally notified of, the hearing upon which the assessment was made. ...\n\n'But, as we have heretofore intimated, the stockholders are not concluded in all respects by the determination of the court, nor is that the fair meaning of chapter 272,  5. A person sued as a shareholder may show, if he can, that he is not a shareholder at all, or that he is not the holder of so large an amount of stock as is alleged, or that he has discharged his liability, or that he has a claim against the corporation which he may, in law or equity, set off against the claim or judgment in assessment, or he may make any other defense which is personal to himself.'\n\n Again, in its latest construction of the act, in 1916, in Finch, Van Slyck & McConville v. John F. Vanasek et al., 132 Minn. 9, 12, 155 N. W. 754, 755, the court uses this language:\n'It was intended by the statute that the proceeding should be summary and without formal pleadings, and it is not controlled by all of the forms usually incident to judicial procedure. The court under the statute deals in the main with probabilities, and is not authorized to determine any fact, other than that of insolvency and the amount of the assessment to be made, which in any way precludes the stockholders in a subsequent action brought to enforce the assessment. The assessment is but preliminary to such an action and therein the stockholders may present all matters that may be available to them in defense. Straw & Ellsworth Mnfg. Co. v. L. D. Kilbourne Boot & Shoe Co.,' supra.\n\n Thus is the expression in the earlier case, 'He [the stockholder] may make any other defense personal to himself,' interpreted in this later case as meaning \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 161]\n\u00a0\n 'all matters that may be available to them [the stockholders] in defense.'\n During the sixteen years between these two decisions that court had under consideration the scope of several such 'orders' [following the language of the act, the court habitually refers to them as 'orders' not 'judgments'] and it has expressed its conclusions as follows:\n In Dwinnell v. Kramer, 87 Minn. 392, 92 N. W. 227 (1902) in a suit upon an assessment order, made under the act we are considering, against the holder of a policy in a mutual insurance company-there is no 'difference, in principle in respect to the question now under consideration, between an action to recover on premium notes, when insolvency of the company has made an assessment on the members necessary, and an action to enforce a stockholder's liability, constitutional or statutory,' 80 Minn. 134, 83 N. W. 38-the defense was made on demurrer that the policy issued to the defendants 'shows upon its face that the defendants were not insured on the mutual plan, and that the extent of their liability by the terms of the policy was the amount of the premium named therein which has been paid.' This defense was entertained and held valid by the court against precisely such a 'judgment' as this court now holds conclusive against a defense in principle precisely similar-that under the contract relation of the defendant to the corporation he was not liable for any double liability assessment.\n Again, in Swing v. Humbird, 94 Minn. 1, 101 N. W. 938 (1904) in an action on an assessment made by the Supreme Court of Ohio in a suit on a mutual insurance company policy, under a statute similar to that of M nnesota, the court holds in the syllabus, paragraph 1:\n'Such assessment is not conclusive upon any policyholder as to the question whether his relation to the company was such as to subject him to liability for an assessment. The judgment making the assessment is, how- \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 162]\n\u00a0\n ever, conclusive as to matters relating to the necessity for, and the amount of, the assessment.'\n\n In the opinion the court says:\n'The plaintiff contends, in effect, that the ex parte decree in question is conclusive upon the defendants upon the question of their liability to assessment for the losses of the company, and that they are barred from urging the defense pleaded in this case. The question of the conclusiveness of an assessment upon stockholders and members of a corporation for the payment of its liabilities made by a court having jurisdiction to wind up its affairs is too well settled in this state to justify any extended discussion of it. Where a court has such jurisdiction of a corporation, its order or decree making an assessment upon its stockholders or members without personal notice to them is conclusive as to all matters relating to the necessity for making the assessment, and the amount thereof. But it does not conclude any stockholder or member as to the question whether his relation to the corporation was such as to subject him to liability for an assessment, or as to any other defense personal to himself' [ citing cases]. ... The assessment in the case last cited [Dwinnell v. Kramer, supra] was made by one of the courts of our own state, yet effect was given to the claim of the defendant that by virtue of his policy contract he was not liable to assessment.'\n\n Here again the same character of defense urged in the instant case was entertained and sustained, viz.: That, notwithstanding the order or judgment, the policies on which the assessment was entered were 'of a class which imposed no liability upon the holders thereof beyond the amount of the cash deposit required.' In the case at bar the character of the corporation is such that no double liability can constitutionally be imposed on any of its stockholders.\n Again, in Swing v. Red River Lumber Co., 105 Minn. \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 163]\n\u00a0\n 336, 117 N. W. 442 (1908), the court had under consideration an assessment upon the policy holders of a mutual insurance company, entered by the Ohio Supreme Court, under a statute similar to that of Minnesota, and the court said:\n'The last contention of the plaintiff to be considered is to the effect that the decree of the Supreme Court of Ohio making the assessment is conclusive upon the defendant upon the question of its liability to be assessed for the losses of the company, and that the trial court in this case, by refusing to give such conclusive effect to the decree, refused to give full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of the state of Ohio, as required by section 1, art. 4, of the federal Constitution. The decree was ex parte as respects the defendant, it having been made without notice to the defendant. The decree, then, the court having jurisdiction of the corporation, was conclusive as to all matters relating to the necessity for and the amount of the assessment; but it is not conclusive as to the question whether the contract relations of an alleged member to the company were such as to subject him to liability for the assessment. It did not, nor could it, deprive a member of the company of any defense going to show that he was not liable to be assessed for the losses of the company. Great Western Tel. Co. v. Purdy, \n162 U.S. 329\n [16 Sup. Ct. 810]; Swing v. Weston Lumber Co., \n205 U.S. 275\n [ 27 Sup. Ct. 497].'\n\n These cases, made complete by Finch, Van Slyck & McConville v. John F. Vanasek, supra, decided in 1916, give us a line of decision, not only general in terms but specific in application, consistently maintained for sixteen years, which, it seems to me, makes it very clear that if the suit commenced in North Dakota, which we are cons dering, had been instituted in a Minnesota court it would have been open to the defendant stockholder to show, in defense, that his relations to the company were such as not to subject him to liability (94 Minn. 1, 101 N. W. 938, and 105 Minn. 336, 117 N. W. 442, supra), and that, therefore, the opinion of the court gives to the \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 164]\n\u00a0\n 'order' of an inferior court of Minnesota a faith and credit in North Dakota which it would not have had in the state of its origin, a result which I venture to think is unsound in principle, anomalous in our judicial history and likely to lead to most unfortunate results.\n The opinion of the court concedes that, notwithstanding this 'judgment,' it was open to the defendant stockholder, in the North Dakota case, to show, if such were the fact, that he was not a stockholder at all; that he owned but half as many shares as was alleged; that he had paid the amount assessed against him in whole or in part, or that he had a set-off to apply on the amount of the assessment. But, novertheless, the court concludes that he cannot be permitted to show, as was true, that he was not, and could never have been, indebted to the receiver on the liability relied upon-and this, notwithstanding that the latest decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, construing the statute of its own state, holds, as quoted above, that in such a suit the stockholders 'may present all metters that may be available to them in defense,' and notwithstanding the fact that the earlier cases also held that such an order is not conclusive as to 'whether the contract relations of the alleged member and the company were such as to subject him to liability for the assessment' (94 Minn. 1, 101 N. W. 938, and 105 Minn. 336, 177 N. W. 442, supra). When we add that the holding of this court in the Bernheimer Case, repeated in the Converse Case, supra, was that 'it may be regarded as settled that upon acquiring stock the stockholder [in a Minnesota corporation] incurred an obligation arising from the constitutional provision, contractual in its nature,' we are seemingly confronted with the conclusion that the decisions of a Supreme Court of a state, construing its own statutes, of the character such as we have here (Flash v. Conn, \n109 \nU.S. 371, 378\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 263), are no longer of controlling influence on this court but may be ignored in its discretion. \n\n[247 U.S. 142, 165]\n\u00a0\n Believing, as I do, that upon the discussion in this opinion and upon the authorities cited, the defense that the insolvent corporation involved was one within the exception of the Minnesota Constitution and that, therefore, no double liability attached to the defendant in error; that under the Minnesota decisions cited this defense could have been successfully made agoinst the order if it had been sued on in a Minnesota court; that the implied finding that the corporation was not within the exception is necessarily jurisdictional, and that therefore it was open to the stockholder to assail it when sued in North Dakota, as it would have been in Minnesota; and that facts sufficient appeared on the face of the complaint to show that in this case the defense was a valid one-I think the judgment of the Dakota courts should be affirmed and therefore I dissent from the decision of the court.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Each stockholder in any corporation, excepting those organized for the purpose of carrying on any kind of manufacturing or mechanical business, shall be liable to the amount of stock held or owned by him. \n\n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARTIN v. COMMERCIAL NAT. BANK OF MACON, GA.(1918)\nNo. 100\nArgued: Decided: January 14, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. R. Douglas Feagin and Rudolph S. Wimberly, both of Macon, Ga., for petitioner. \n\n[245 U.S. 513, 514]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Orville A. Park and George S. Jones, both of Macon, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.\n As security for money presently loaned to him in good faith by the Commercial National Bank, one Virgin executed and delivered a mortgage upon his stock of merchandise at Macon, Ga., February 16, 1914. It was recorded August 20, 1914, when the bank knew of his insolvency. The next day involuntary bankruptcy pro- \n\n[245 U.S. 513, 515]\n\u00a0\n ceedings were instituted and in due time he was adjudged bankrupt and a trustee appointed. Recordation of the mortgage was not fraudulently delayed and prior thereto no other liens were fixed upon the property. Both trustee and other creditors objected to the bank's claim as one entitled to priority 'on the ground that the mortgage was recorded within the four months period preceding bankruptcy, at a time when the mortgagor was insolvent, and when the mortgagee knew that he was insolvent, and the recording of the mortgage would effect a preference, and that the transfer arising from the recording of the instrument was nonoperative, and that the instrument must be held as not recorded.' Their contention here is thus stated:\n'The trustee does not say in this case that his lien is older than the bank's and therefore he comes ahead of the bank, but he says that the bank's lien is invalid and inoperative, because recorded while the bankrupt was insolvent, etc., and that, being a subsequent lienholder, the trustee is in the proper position to attack the bank's lien. The bank's lien is invalid only by the positive inhibition of the statute, section 60b. It is for this reason invalid just as a transfer made (instead of recorded) within this four months' period is invalid by reason of the inhibition of the Bankruptcy Law.' 'The record of an instrument is required as to any particular person if the instrument must be recorded to be good against him. If the subsequent lienor is entitled to priority unless the antecedent mortgage is recorded, such mortgage is required to be recorded as to him. The trustee is a subsequent lienor. Unless the mortgage is recorded he, the trustee, is entitled to priority. It is therefore 'required' to be recorded as to him.'\n\n The referee allowed the claim as preferred and the Circuit Court of Appeals approved his action. 228 Fed. 651, 143 C. C. A. 173. \n\n[245 U.S. 513, 516]\n\u00a0\n It is provided by section 60b, Bankruptcy Act, as amended June 25, 1910, c. 412, 36 Stat. 838, 842 (Comp. St. 1916,  9644):\n'If a bankrupt shall ... have made a transfer of any of his property, and if, at the time of the transfer, ... or of ... the recording or registering of the transfer if by law recording or registering thereof is required, and being within four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy or after the filing thereof and before the adjudication, the bankrupt be insolvent and the judgment or transfer then operate as a preference, and the person receiving it or to be benefited thereby, or his agent acting therein, shall then have reasonable cause to believe that the enforcement of such judgment or transfer would effect a preference, it shall be voidable by the trustee and he may recover the property or its value from such person.'\n\n Section 47a of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St. 1916,  9631) provides:\n'Trustees shall respectively: ... (2) Collect and reduce to money the property of the estates for which they are trustees, under the direction of the court, and close up the estate as expeditiously as is compatible with the best interests of the parties in interest; and such trustees, as to all property in the custody or coming into the custody of the bankruptcy court, shall be deemed vested with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a creditor holding a lien by legal or equitable proceedings thereon; and also, as to all property not in the custody of the bankruptcy court, shall be deemed vested with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a judgment creditor holding an execution duly returned unsatisfied. ...'\n\n Section 3260, Georgia Code of 1910, declares that:\n'Mortgages not recorded within the time required remain valid as against the mortgagor, but are postponed to all other liens created or obtained, or purchases made prior to the actual record of the mortgage. If, however, \n\n[245 U.S. 513, 517]\n\u00a0\n the younger lien is created by contract, and the party receiving it has notice of the prior unrecorded mortgage, or the purchaser has the like notice, then the lien of the older mortgage shall be held good against them.'\n\n Construing this section, in Hawes v. Glover, 126 Ga. 305, 317, 55 S. E. 62, 67, the Supreme Court held:\n'A mortgage is perfectly valid as between the parties thereto, though never recorded. Hardaway v. Semmes, 24 Ga. 305; Gardiner v. Moore, 51 Ga. 268; Myers v. Picquet, 61 Ga. 260; Civil Code,  2727 (Park's Ann. Code,  3260). If it is not recorded, or, as in this case, is illegally recorded, the only effect is to postpone it to purchases made, or liens procured by contract, without notice of its existence or to liens obtained by operation of law.'\n\n Section 60b, Bankruptcy Act, has been specially considered by us in two recent cases-Bailey v. Baker Ice Machine Co., \n239 U.S. 268\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 50, and Carey v. Donohue, \n240 U.S. 430\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 386, L. R. A. 1917A, 295. In the first the company installed an ice machine for Grant Bros. at Horton, Kan., during February, under a conditional sale contract of earlier date and recorded May 15th following, when the purchasers were known to be insolvent; July 11th they became bankrupt. Such a contract is valid under the laws of Kansas as between the parties whether recorded or not, but void as against a creditor of the vendee who fastens a lien upon the property by execution, attachment or like process prior to recording. The vendors demanded the machine. The trustee maintained section 47a, Bankruptcy Act, gave him the status of a lienholder prior to recordation and that the contract, having been put to record within four months, operated as a preference voidable under section 60b. We held the trustee occupied the status of a creditor with a lien fixed as of the date when the bankruptcy proceedings commenced and that he could not assail the contract under the state law; further, that section 60b refers to an act whereby the bankrupt sur- \n\n[245 U.S. 513, 518]\n\u00a0\n renders or incumbers his property for the benefit of a particular creditor, thereby diminishing the estate which should be applied to all; the contract in question did not operate as a preferential transfer; the property was not the bankrupts', but the vendor's; the former were not to become owners until the condition was performed; and there was no diminution of the estate.\n In Carey v. Donohue the trustee sought to set aside a real estate transfer executed more than four months before bankruptcy, but recorded within that time. Under the Ohio Statute conveyances of land until filed for record are deemed fraudulent as to subsequent bona fide purchasers without knowledge, but recording is not essential to their validity as against any creditor, whether general creditor, lien creditor, or judgment creditor with execution returned unsatisfied, that is, as against any class of persons represented by a trustee in bankruptcy or with whose rights, remedies, and powers he is deemed to be vested. We denied the trustee's contention and, among other things, declared:\n'Required' has regard to persons in whose favor the requirement is imposed. 'Congress did not undertake in section 60 to hit all preferential transfers, otherwise valid, merely because they were not disclosed, either by record or possession, more than four months before the bankruptcy proceedings.' 'It is plain that the words are not limited to cases where recording is required for the purpose of giving validity to the transaction as between the parties. For that purpose, no amendment of the original act was needed, as in such a case there could be no giving of a preference without recording.' 'In dealing with a transfer, as defined, which, though valid as between the parties, was one which was 'required' to be recorded, the reference was necessarily to a requirement in the interest of others who were in the contemplation of Congress in enacting the provision.' 'The intended meaning was to embrace \n\n[245 U.S. 513, 519]\n\u00a0\n those cases in which recording was necessary in order to make the transfer valid as against those concerned in the distribution of the insolvent estate; that s, as against creditors, including those whose position the trustee was entitled to take.'\n\n The word 'required' in section 60b refers directly to statutes in many states relating to recording which through various forms of expression seek to protect creditors by providing that their rights shall be superior to transfers while off the record. Recognizing the beneficial results of these enactments and intending that rights based thereon might be utilized for the advantage of bankrupt estates, Congress inserted ( amendment of 1910) the clause 'or of the recording or registering of the transfer if by law recording or registering thereof is required.' In Carey v. Donohue we pointed out that purchasers are not of those in whose favor registration is 'required,' but that the reference is to persons concerned in the distribution of the estate, i. e., 'creditors including those whose position the trustee was entitled to take.' And we think it properly follows that before a trustee may avoid a transfer because of the provision in question he must in fact represent or be entitled to take the place of some creditor whose claim actually stood in a superior position to the challenged transfer while unrecorded and within the specified period.\n The Georgia statute imposes the requirement of registration only in favor of a creditor who fixes a lien on the property before recording takes place. Here there is no such person; the trustee occupies the status of one who acquired a lien after that event. No one concerned in the distribution of the estate actually held rights superior to the mortgage while off the record.\n The judgment of the court below is correct, and must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARTIN v. LANKFORD(1918)\nNo. 97\nArgued: Decided: January 28, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 547, 548]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles West, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The action is in certain particulars similar to No. 96 (\n245 U.S. 541\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 203, 62 L. Ed. --) and was submitted with it. The citizenship of the parties, however, is not diverse as in the other action, they being all citizens of Oklahoma. There is a further \n\n[245 U.S. 547, 549]\n\u00a0\n difference from the other action in that in the latter the plaintiff was a depositor in the bank while in this he is a stockholder as well as a depositor and seeks to have his stockholder's liability of $2,000 offset against any sums that may be owing to him by reason of the matters set forth in his petition, Lankford, as bank commissioner, having refused to do so. Wherein and wherefore Lankford should have done so and wherein and wherefore he violated his duty to plaintiff through wrongful and neglectful conduct is charged in three causes of action substantially the same as the petition in No. 96, varied only to suit the differences in demand. In other words, that plaintiff lost his deposit because of neglect of duty upon the part of Lankford in the following particulars: (1) Failure to exercise proper supervision over the bank as directed by the statute of the state. (2) Allowing the parties in charge of the bank to squander its assets. (3) Allowing it to continue business while and after its reserve was greatly less than required by law. (4) Allowing its managers continuously and repeatedly to make excessive loans and excessive overdrafts. (5) Allowing such managers to remain in charge of its affairs, knowing them to be incompetent and notwithstanding it was his duty to discover such incompetency and, upon discovery, to take possession of the bank for the protection of its depositors and stockholders.\n Plaintiff hence prayed that his stockholder's liability of $2,000 be offset against the sums due him, which he alleged to be $669.25 and interest thereon.\n The Attorney General of the state appeared specially and alleged that the state 'is a necessary party in interest to a proper determination of the issues described in the plaintiff's petition,' that it 'does not consent to be sued in this case and objects to the action being maintained against it.' The motion concluded as follows: 'Wherefore the state of Oklahoma moves the court to dismiss this \n\n[245 U.S. 547, 550]\n\u00a0\n action for want of jurisdiction over the party defendant.'\n Thereupon, by permission of the court, plaintiff inserted at the end of each cause of action an amendment in substance as follows: That the enforcement of the law of the state through Lankford, as bank c mmissioner, abridges plaintiff's privileges and immunities as a citizen of the United States in that Lankford allowed and paid out of the assets of the bank and out of the guaranty fund the deposits of other persons similarly situated with plaintiff and refused arbitrarily to pay his, plaintiff's, deposit. And by the imposition of the lien on the assets of the bank by the state for the sums advanced by it to the payment of such other depositors postpones and prevents the collection of plaintiff's deposit because the amount so advanced is greater than the assets, and that plaintiff was entitled to the same treatment as other depositors.\n The court then passed upon the motion to dismiss and granted it, reciting that the question of jurisdiction was alone involved.\n The petition charges delinquency on the part of Lankford whereby the bank's officers were enabled to so conduct its affairs as to bring it to insolvency, making it necessary for him to take possession of it with its assets depleted. The petition also charges such conduct after he took possession as to subordinate plaintiff's claim to that of other depositors in the same situation. His conduct in this last particular, it is said, was in violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitution of the United States.\n We assume that the amendment to the petition which charges that the lien of the state upon the assets of the bank was so enforced as to give other depositors a preference was intended to be but another way of asserting violation of the Constitution, not by the law of the state, but by the wrongful administration of the law by Lank- \n\n[245 U.S. 547, 551]\n\u00a0\n ford. Indeed the petition negatives state action. It is based, as we have seen, upon the tortious conduct of Lankford, not in exertion of the state law but in violation of it. The reasoning of No. 96 is therefore applicable and the conclusion must be the same, that is, the action is not one against the state, and the District Court erred in dismissing it for want of jurisdiction on that ground.\n We say 'on that ground,' for we are brought to the consideration whether the judgment of dismissal can be sustained upon another ground. There is confusion in the petition and the argument used to support it. As we have seen, Lankford is charged with dereliction of duty whereby plaintiff in error has been injured; but there is an assignment of error based upon the due process and other clauses of the Constitution of the United States. They were violated, the assignment recites, by Lankford's conduct by which other depositors were preferred to plaintiff, and the decision was 'without evidence, without notice, without a hearing provided by law, and without an opportunity afforded by law for judicial review,' and that the District Court erred in deciding that 'the consequent action based upon said facts against' Lankford and the insurance company as his surety 'was in effect one against the state of Oklahoma.'\n In No. 96 we said of a like allegation that it was only possible to regard it as emphasis of Lankford's wrongdoing, not as an independent ground of recovery. To hold otherwise would be to disregard the whole scheme of plaintiff's petition which is, as we have seen, a cause of action against Lankford because of his derelictions. This being the nature of the action, the District Court erred in regarding it as one against the state and dismissing it on that ground. But, however, its judgment was right, plaintiff and Lankford being citizens of the same state, and the Surety Insurance Company being an Oklahoma corporation, and therefore the judgment must be affirmed.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCCOY v. UNION ELEVATED R. CO.(1918)\nNo. 190\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. Harry S. Mecartney and John S. Miller, both of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis W. Walker, Roger L. Foote, and Addison L. Gardner, all of Chicago, Ill., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n William A. McCoy, testator of plaintiffs in error, owned a hotel situated at the northwest corner of Clark and Van Buren streets, Chicago. During 1897 defendants constructed along the latter street and in front of the building an elevated passenger railroad of the ordinary type and have continued to maintain and operate it. Charging that construction, maintenance, and operation of the railroad had caused and would continue to cause injury to the property by noise, smoke, dirt, shutting off air and light, disturbing privacy, and impairing the freedom of ingress and egress, and that its market value had been greatly reduced, McCoy brought a common-law action (September, 1902) in a state court to recover the entire damage.\n The declaration does not allege plaintiff's ownership of the fee in the street, but asserts his interest in the lot and right to the 'easements and privileges which legally appertain and rightfully belong to property abutting public streets' in Chicago, including the right of light, air, access, privacy, view, etc. Trial to a jury upon plea of not guilty during February, 1914, resulted in verdict for defendants, and judgment thereon was affirmed by the Supreme Court, a writ of error having been sued out by McCoy's executors. 271 Ill. 490, 111 N. E. 517. That court's statement of facts follows:\n'During the years 1896 and 1897 what is generally known as the 'loop' was constructed, under authority conferred by ordinances of the city of Chicago, for the joint use of the three systems above mentioned and an- \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n other elevated system then in course of construction. The loop consists of an elevated structure in the streets encircling the central portion of the business district of the city, upon which are laid tracks for the passage of the elevated trains of all of the defendant companies completely around the central portion of the business district. Before the construction of the loop the elevated trains of the defendant companies stopped at their respective terminals. The structure forming the south side of the loop was placed in that portion of Van Buren street extending from Wabash avenue on the east to Fifth avenue on the west, Clark street being one of the streets intersecting Van Buren street between these two avenues.\n\n'Stations to permit passengers to board and leave the elevated trains were established at intervals around the loop and stairways were constructed leading from each station to the surface of the street. One of these stations in Van Buren street was established at La Salle street, about 100 feet west from the McCoy Hotel, and another was established at Dearborn street, about 300 feet east from the hotel. The elevated structure in Van Buren street obstructed the passage of light to the storerooms in McCoy's building, and the noise from the passage of trains over the structure and the fact that passing trains were on a level with the windows of the second floor of the building rendered the rooms on the south side of the second and third floors of the building less desirable for hotel purposes. Large upright columns supporting the elevated structure were placed just inside the curb in front of the premises and rendered the premises less accessible from the street.\n\n'There is no material controversy over the facts in the case. The witnesses all agree that the matters above mentioned, when considered by themselves, would be detrimental to the premises. They also agree that there was a steady increase of from 5 to 10 per cent. per year \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n in the value of the premises from the construction of the loop until 1905. It also appears from the evidence that the rents from the storerooms on the ground floor constantly increased after 1897. The plaintiff called but one real estate expert as a witness. He testified that the damages to the property from the construction of the elevated structure, and the operation of the trains thereon, amounted to $81,999, being 15 per cent. of the value which the witness placed upon the interest of McCoy in the premises. He admitted that there had been a continuous increase in the value of the premises since the completion of the loop, and that a port on of that increase, which he said it was impossible to estimate, was due to the increased travel brought to the premises by the elevated railroad, but that he did not take that into consideration in fixing the damages.\n\n'The real estate experts called by the defendants, on the other hand, testified that at least one-half of the increase in the value of the premises was due to the increased travel in front of the premises resulting from the operation of the elevated railroad in Van Buren street as a part of the loop. In support of the testimony of these witnesses defendants proved that the number of persons boarding the elevated trains at the La Salle street station, in Van Buren street, during the three months of the year 1897 in which trains were operated around the loop, was 161,763, and that the number constantly increased, until in 1905 there were 3,659,583 persons who boarded the trains at that station. It was also shown that during the period in 1897 above mentioned 194,904 persons boarded the elevated trains at the Dearborn street station, in Van Buren street, and that the number constantly increased each year until in 1905 there were 2,558,976 persons who boarded the trains at that station.'\n\n During the trial, over plaintiff's objections, questions concerning evidence were determined in accordance with \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n repeated rulings by the Illinois Supreme Court that the effect of construction, maintenance, and operation of an elevated road upon market value was the point for determination, and that increase in such value caused by the improvement itself should be considered and treated as a special benefit, although enjoyed by other neighborhood property.\n Among others, plaintiff requested the following instructions:\n'The jury are instructed that the Constitution of this state provides that 'private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation.' This action is brought by plaintiff for an alleged damage to the property of plaintiff arising from the construction [maintenance and operation] of the structure in the abutting street for elevated railroad purposes. Such damages in the eye of the law can only be a loss in the market value of the property arising from the said construction [maintenance and operation] for the purposes aforesaid. Whether the premises in question have in fact been so damaged is for the jury to find from the evidence, according to the method and within the limitations of other instructions given you.\n\n'The court instructs the jury that 'benefits' and 'damages' spoken of in the instruction mean benefits and damages to the market value thereof, and that by the term 'market value' of property, as used in these instructions, is meant the price at which the owner, if desirous of selling, would under ordinary circumstances surrounding the sales of property have sold the property for, and what a person desirous as purchaser would have paid for it under the same circumstances.\n\n'The jury are instructed that, in considering the question of whether the premises in question were or were not damaged by the construction of the structure in the abutting street for elevated railroad purposes, \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n they are to exclude from consideration all benefit which accrued to the said premises or to the owners thereof by reason of improved travel facilities furnished by said elevated railroad.'\n\n The words 'maintenance and operation' were inserted in the first of these requests and as thus amended it was given; the others were refused.\n The following instructions were also given:\n'The court instructs the jury that benefits and damages spoken of in these instructions mean benefits and damages to the fair cash market value thereof, and that by the term 'fair cash market value of the property,' as used in these instructions, is meant its value as determined by what it would sell for in the market for cash in the due course of business. This does not mean the price at which it would sell under special circumstances, ut its value as sold in the market under ordinary circumstances for cash, and not on time, and assuming that the owner is willing and not compelled to sell, and the purchaser is willing and under no compulsion to purchase.\n\n'The jury is instructed that, if you believe from the evidence that plaintiff's premises have been increased in their fair cash market value by the construction, maintenance, and operation of defendants' said railroad, and if you also believe from the evidence that other property in the neighborhood of the plaintiff's premises not abutting upon the defendants' railroad have been likewise increased in their fair cash market value by the construction, maintenance, and operation of said railroad, but to a greater extent than the plaintiff's said premises, you have no right from that fact to find that the plaintiff's premises have been damaged.\n\n'Special benefits are such benefits as are special or peculiar to a particular piece of property, and which beneficially affect its fair cash market value, as distinguished from those benefits which are common to the \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 360]\n\u00a0\n public at large, and which are termed general benefits; and you are instructed that in determining the effect of the construction, maintenance, and operation of defendants' elevated railroad upon the fair cash market value of plaintiff's said premises, you are not to take into consideration any general benefits which you may believe from the evidence to have arisen out of the construction, maintenance, and operation of said elevated railroad, but you should take into consideration special benefits, if any, shown by the evidence to plaintiff's said premises from the construction, maintenance, and operation of defendants' said elevated railroad.\n\n'The jury is instructed that, if you believe from the evidence that the property of the plaintiff described in the declaration of this case was enhanced in its fair cash market value by reason of the construction, maintenance, and operation of the elevated railroad of the defendant, such increase in market value is a special benefit to the property of the plaintiff, and not a general benefit, notwithstanding you may believe from the evidence that the other property in the vicinity of plaintiff's property also was enhanced in fair cash market value to a greater or less degree by reason of the construction, maintenance, and operation of defendants' said elevated railroad.\n\n'The jury is instructed that the measure of damages in a case of this kind is the difference between the fair cash market value of the premises with the elevated railroad constructed, maintained, and operated in the street in front of it and what the fair cash market value of said premises would have been had not said elevated railroad been so constructed, maintained, and operated. If you believe from the evidence that the fair cash market value of the plaintiff's premises with the railroad constructed, maintained, and operated in Van Buren street has not been diminished below what you believe \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 361]\n\u00a0\n from the evidence the fair cash market value of said premises would have been if the said elevated railroad had not been constructed, maintained, and operated in said street, then said plaintiff's premises have not been damaged by the construction, maintenance, and operation of defendants' elevated railroad.'\n\n The Supreme Court said:\n'The contention made by plaintiffs in error upon which most of the assignments of error depend is that the benefits to the premises by reason of the increased travel in front of the premises resulting from the operation of the elevated railroad in Van Buren street as a part of the loop cannot be considered in determining whether the premises have been damaged by the construction of the elevated structure and the operation of trains thereon: First, because such benefits are general benefits, common to all the property in the vicinity; and, second, because such benefits are conjectural and speculative. The same contention was made in Brand v. Union Elevated Railroad C ., 258 Ill. 133 [101 N. E. 247, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 473, L. R. A. 1918A, 878] Geohegan v. Union Elevated Railroad Co., 258 Ill. 352 [ 101 N. E. 577, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 572, 45 L. R. A. (N. S.) 167], and Geohegan v. Union Elevated Railroad Co., 266 Ill. 482 [107 N. E. 786, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 762], and in each of those cases we held that such benefits should be considered in determining whether premises abutting on a public street have been damaged by the construction and operation of an elevated railroad in such street. The reasons for such holding were fully set forth in the opinions filed in the cases above mentioned, and it would serve no useful purpose to repeat them here. It is sufficient to say that we adhere to the views expressed in the former cases involving the same question as is here presented . ... Complaint is made of the action of the court in giving certain instructions on behalf of defendants in error and in refusing or modifying certain instructions submitted by plaintiff. ... Moreover, the evidence in this case would not have sustained a verdict in favor of the plain- \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 362]\n\u00a0\n tiff, and any error committed by the trial court in giving, refusing, or modifying instructions was therefore harmless.'\n\n In their brief here counsel for plaintiffs in error declare:\n'Plaintiff presented his case, therefore, upon the basis that his damage was to be estimated:\n\n'(1) By taking the market value of the premises immediately before the advent of the loop; then\n\n'(2) To consider how the structure in question placed in the block upon which his premises abutted (which defined the 'physical' scope of his property or rights), forever dedicated to railroad uses and to be operated therefor, would actually interfere with the actual use and enjoyment of the premises; and then\n\n'(3) To estimate to what extent such structure put or dedicated to such use, would reduce that market value. That is, to capitalize the permanent interference, i. e., damage. (As laid down in Lewis [3d Ed .]  693).\n\n'In the trial court the main conflict was waged over the question as to whether or not the court should admit on behalf of defendants evidence of 'general' or 'travel' benefits occurring from the establishment of the loop in its entirety, or whether the evidence should be held down to the issue of 'direct, proximate, and physical effect.' Said court, following the late ruling of the Illinois Supreme Court in Brand v. Union Elev. R. R. Co., 258 Ill. 133, 101 N. E. 247, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 473, L. R. A. 1918A, 878 (a review of which was asked in this court in \n238 U.S. 586\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 846, same title), tried the case upon the basis of allowing this special damage to be offset or reduced by, or considered in connection with, the estimated amount of market benefit that accrued to the premises from 'travel benefits.\"\n\n And they now maintain that the judgment below is erroneous because it : (1) Impairs the contract which their testator made when he purchased the property contrary to section 10, art. 1, Federal Constitution; (2) denies to them \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 363]\n\u00a0\n the equal protection of the law; and (3) deprives them of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The first claim is clearly untenable; the contract clause prohibits legislative, not judicial, action. Ross v. Oregon, \n227 \nU.S. 150, 161\n, 164 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 220, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 224; Moore-Mansfield Co. v. Electrical Co., \n234 \nU.S. 619, 623\n, 624 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 941; Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 344\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 582. Nothing in the record affords support for the second claim. The third demands consideration.\n We may examine proceedings in state courts for appropriation of private property to public purposes so far as to inquire whether a rule of law was adopted in absolute disregard of the owner's right to just compensation. If the necessary result was to deprive him of property without such compensation, then due process of law was denied him, cont ary to Fourteenth Amendment. Chicago, Burlington, etc., R. R. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 246\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 581; Backus v. Fort Street Union Depot Co., \n169 \nU.S. 557, 565\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 445; Fayerweather v. Ritch, \n195 \nU.S. 276, 298\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 58. Our concern is not to ascertain whether the rule adopted by the state is the one best supported by reason or authority nor with mere errors in course of trial, but with denial of a fundamental right. Appleby v. Buffalo, \n221 \nU.S. 524, 532\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 699. And see McGovern v. New York, \n229 \nU.S. 363, 371\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 876, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 391. And here it must be noted that the claim is for damages to property not actually taken from the owner's dominion.\n The Illinois Constitution provides:\n'Private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation.'\n\n In Peoria, Bloomington & Champaign Traction Co. v. Vance et al., 225 Ill. 270, 272, 80 N. E. 134, 135 (9 L. R. A. [N. S.] 781) where the owner sought damages to the balance of his farm resulting from taking a right of way for an electric road, the court pointed out the applicable doctrine long established in the state. It said:\n'Since the adoption of the Constitution of 1870 it has \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 364]\n\u00a0\n been uniformly held by this court, in such cases as this, that the measure of damages to land not taken is 'the difference in the fair cash market value of the land before and after the construction of the railroad,' or 'the amount, if any, which lands not taken will be depreciated in their fair cash market value by the construction and operation of the proposed road.' ... Under the rule adopted in this state for determining whether or in what amount, property not taken will be damaged by the construction and operation of a railroad, any benefits which are not conjectural or speculative, and which actually enhance the market value of such property, are to be considered as special benefits, and not as general benefits, within the meaning of the rule that general benefits cannot be considered in determining whether, or in what amount, property not taken will be damaged. Special benefits do not become general benefits because the benefits are common to other property in the vicinity. The fact that other property in the vicinity of the proposed railroad will also be increased in value by reason of the construction and operation thereof furnishes no excuse for excluding the consideration of special benefits to the particular property in determining whether it has been damaged, and, if it has, the extent of the depreciation in value.'\n\n This doctrine was again expressly affirmed in Brand v. Union Elevated Railroad, 258 Ill. 133, 101 N. E. 247, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 473, L. R. A. 1918A, 878, a proceeding like the present one to recover damages caused by constructing, maintaining, and operating an elevated railroad along the street. The trial court below accepted and applied the approved rule, and we are now asked to declare that it absolutely disregards the owner's fundamental right to just compensation; that it necessarily deprives him of such compensation.\n How far benefits must be considered in determining damages to property when claimed on account of a public improvement is a vexed question which has given occasion \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 365]\n\u00a0\n for numberless decisions in different states, as well as much legislation. The matter is elaborately treated and the cases collected in Lewis on Eminent Domain and Nichols on Eminent Domain. In the former (section 687, 3d Ed.) it is said:\n'The decisions may be divided into five classes, according as they maintain one or the other of the following propositions: First. Benefits cannot be considered at all. Second. Special benefits may be set off against damages to the remainder, but not against the value of the part taken. Third. Benefits, whether general or special, may be set off as in the last proposition. Fourth. Special benefits may be set off against both damages to the rema nder or the value of the part taken. Fifth. Both general and special benefits may be set off as in the last proposition.'\n\n The latter work, at section 256 (2d Ed.) says:\n'It is universally recognized that when there is no taking the damages to a tract of land from the construction of a public work cannot be correctly ascertained without determining whether the tract has been depreciated in value, and to determine this all the effects of the public work, beneficial or injurious, must be considered. Strictly speaking, it is said, it is not a question of benefits at all, except that proof of benefits might be one way of showing that there had been no injury. The real question is, had the property in question been decreased in market value by the construction of the public improvement, and the amount of damage is the decrease in such value. In most states, however, it is only special benefits that can be set off; but in the states which allow the set-off of general benefits to remaining land when part of a tract is taken, the same latitude is given in awarding damages when no land is taken.'\n\n The fundamental right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is that the owner shall not be deprived of the market value of his property under a rule of law which makes it impossible for him to obtain just compensation. \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 366]\n\u00a0\n There is no guaranty that he shall derive a positive pecuniary advantage from a public work whenever a neighbor does. It is almost universally held that in arriving at the amount of damage to property not taken allowance should be made for peculiar and individual benefits conferred upon it; compensation to the owner in that form is permissible. And we are unable to say that he suffers deprivation of any fundamental right when a state goes one step further and permits consideration of actual benefits- enhancement in market value-flowing directly from a public work, although all in the neighborhood receive like advantages. In such case the owner really loses nothing which he had before; and it may be said with reason, there has been no real injury.\n This subject was much discussed in Bauman v. Ross, \n167 \nU.S. 548, 574\n, 584 S., 17 Sup. Ct. 966, 976 (42 L. Ed. 270). Through Mr. Justice Gray we there said:\n'The just compensation required by the Constitution to be made to the owner is to be measured by the loss caused to him by the appropriation. He is entitled to receive the value of what he has been deprived of, and no more. To award him less would be unjust to him; to award him more would be unjust to the public. Consequently, when part only of a parcel of land is taken for a highway, the value of that part is not the sole measure of the compensation or damages to be paid to the owner; but the incidental injury or benefit to the part not taken is also to be considered. When the part not taken is left in such shape or condition, as to be in itself of less value than before, the owner is entitled to additional damages on that account. When, on the other hand, the part which he retains is specially and directly increased in value by the public improvement, the damages to the whole parcel by the appropriation of part of it are lessened. ... The Constitution of the United States contains no express prohibition against considering benefits in estimating the just compensation to be paid for pri- \n\n[247 U.S. 354, 367]\n\u00a0\n vate property taken for the public use; and, for the reasons and upon the authorities above stated, no such prohibition can be implied; and it is therefore within the authority of Congress, in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, to direct that, when part of a parcel of land is appropriated to the public use for a highway in the District of Columbia, the tribunal vested by law with the duty of assessing the compensation or damages due to the owner, whether for the value of the part taken, or for any injury to the rest, shall take into consideration, by way of lessening the whole or either part of the sum due him, and special and direct benefits, capable f present estimate and reasonable computation, caused by the establishment of the highway to the part not taken.'\n\n See Martin v. District of Columbia, \n205 U.S. 135\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 440.\n The judgment below is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCCURDY v. U.S.(1918)\nNo. 685\nArgued: January 18, 1918Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 263, 264]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Preston A. Shinn, of Pawhuska, Okl., for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful, for the United States.\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 263, 265]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Osage Tribe of Indians consisted in 1906 of 2,000 persons. Their reservation, located in Oklahoma Territory between the Arkansas river and the Kansas state line, contained about a million and a half acres of fertile well-watered prairie land and of heavily timbered hill lands, largely underlaid with petroleum, natural gas, coal and other minerals. At that time the United States held for the tribe a trust fund of $8,373,658. 54 received under various treaties as compensation for relinquishing other lands. The annual income of the tribe from interest on this trust fund and from rentals of grazing, oil, and gas lands was nearly $1,000,000; that is , $500 for every man, woman and child, in addition to the earnings of individuals. \n1\n Congress, concluding apparently that the enjoyment of wealth without responsibility was demoralizing to the Osages, decided upon the policy of gradual emancipation. By Act of June 28, 1906 (34 Stat. 539, c. 3572), it provided for an equal division among them of the trust fund and the lands. The trust fund was to be divided by placing to the credit of each member of the tribe his pro rata share which should thereafter be held for the benefit of himself and his heirs for the period of twenty- five years and then paid over to them respectively (sections 4 and 5).2 \n\n[246 U.S. 263, 266]\n\u00a0\n The lands were to be divided by giving to each member the right to make, from the tribal lands, three selections of 160 acres each and to designate which of these should constitute his homestead. A commission was appointed to divide among the members also, the remaining lands, after setting aside enough for county use, school sites and other small reservations. The oil, gas, coal and other mineral rights were reserved to the tribe for the period of twenty-five years with provision for leasing the same. The homesteads were made inalienable and nontaxable for twenty-five years or until otherwise provided by Congress. All other allotted lands-which were known as 'surplus lands,' were made inalienable for twenty-five years and nontaxable for three years, except that power was vested with the Secretary of the Interior to issue to any adult member, upon his petition, a certificate of competency, authorizing him to sell all of his surplus lands; and upon its issue all his surplus lands became immediately taxable. By Act of April 18, 1912,  53 (37 Stat. \n\n[246 U.S. 263, 267]\n\u00a0\n 86, 87, c. 83), Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to pay to any Osage allottee 'in his discretion' 'under rules and regulations to be prescribed by him and upon application therefor' all or part of the funds held for his benefit, provided the Secretary is satisfied either that the allottee is competent or that such payment would be to 'the manifest best interest and welfare of the allottee.'\n In 1913 (apparently in March) the Secretary paid from the principal of the trust funds held for Robert Panther, a noncompetent4 allottee the sum of $1,750, which was applied in payment for a lot of land in the city of Pawhuska. The land when purchased was conveyed to one Brenner as trustee for Robert and Emma Panther, but soon after was conveyed by Brenner to Robert individually. The deed to Robert contained the following clause:\n'This conveyance is made and accepted with the understanding, and under the condition that the above described property is to be and remain inalienable and not subject to transfer, sale or incumbrance, for a period of eighteen years from the 1st day of July, 1913, except by and with the express consent and approval of the Secretary of the Interior, or his successor in office.'\n\n The land as originally a part of the Osage Reservation and became part of Pawhuska when that town was established under the Osage Township Act (March 3, 1905, c. 1479, 33 Stat. 1061). When Oklahoma was admitted into the Union in 1907, the town became the city of Pawhuska and a part of Osage county. The land had passed into private ownership before 1908, became taxable then under the laws of Oklahoma and taxes were assessed thereon and \n\n[246 U.S. 263, 268]\n\u00a0\n were paid until about the time of the conveyance to Brenner in trust for the Panthers. Then default was made and the land was sold by the county treasurer for failure to pay taxes for the second half of 1912\n\n\n In January, 1917, the United States tendered to the holder of the tax certificate and to the county treasurer, the amount of the 1912 and 1913 taxes and penalties and demanded a redemption receipt. The tender was refused, because it did not include the taxes and penalties for 1914, 1915 and 1916; and the county treasurer gave notice of intention to issue the tax deed. Thereupon the United States filed, in the federal District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, this suit against the county treasurer for an injunction to restrain the issue of the tax deed. The government contended, that as the land had been bought for Panther and was by deed made inalienable without the consent of the Secretary of Interior, it was while so held, an instrumentality lawfully employed by the government for the protection of an Indian and as such exempt from taxation by the state or any subdivision thereof. On the other hand the county treasurer and the city (which was permitted to intervene) contended that Congress had not authorized the Secretary of the Interior to invest the trust fund for the Indians' benefit or to impose restriction on alienation of property purchased with money from that source; that the insertion in the deed of the provision against alienation, did not have the effect of exempting the land from taxation by the state; and that it was not the intention of Congress to do so. It was also contended that such exemption was not within the powers of Congress as limited by article 4,  3, and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution; since before imposing the restriction by deed, the land had become a part of the private property subject to the jurisdiction of the state. A decree was entered granting, in effect, an injunction against taxation during the period of restric- \n\n[246 U.S. 263, 269]\n\u00a0\n tion of alienation; and the case is brought here on direct appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [ Comp. St. 1916,  1215]), on the ground that constitutional questions are involved.\n The jurisdiction of this court was questioned; but the case is properly here. The constitutional question is substantial, was properly raised below, and was passed upon there. We have, however, no occasion to consider it; since all questions involved in the case are before us ( Northwestern Laundry v. Des Moines, \n239 \nU.S. 486, 491\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 206) and there are other grounds on which the decree must be reversed.\n Under the Act of Judge 28, 1906, the Secretary of the Interior had no authority to release or to invest any part of the principal of the trust fund held for Panther. His authority to release rests wholly upon section 5 of the Act of April 18, 1912. That section confers upon him, if application is made therefor, discretion whether to release or to withhold. If the release 'would be to the manifest best interests of the allottee' it may be made although the allottee is not competent, as that term is defined in section 9 of the act. The Secretary is authorized to prescribe the rules and regulations under which such releases shall be made; but he is not given authority to exercise control of any property in which the funds released may thereafter be invested, or otherwise to create with the released funds a governmental instrumentality for the protection of the Osages. Congress apparently b lieved that in order to prepare the Indian for complete independence, he must be educated in self-control, and that this could best be done by committing to him gradually the care of his property. That course necessarily involved the risk of some property being lost through improvidence. But in the case of the Osages the risk was not attended by serious danger. Even if the whole trust fund should be released and, despite supervision, improvidently spent, the legally competent allottee would \n\n[246 U.S. 263, 270]\n\u00a0\n still have his homestead and his share in valuable undivided oil, gas and coal rights; and the legally incompetent, his surplus lands in addition. There is nothing in the act or in the facts to which it applies that indicates a purpose to extend governmental control to property in which released funds may be invested. And there are in both the Act of 1906 and in that of 1912, provisions which show that Congress intended to restrict the tax exemption. By section 2 of the Act of 1906 the surplus lands became taxable after three years, even if they remained inalienable. By section 7 of the Act of 1912 both the lands and funds of allottees or their heirs are protected against claims arising prior to competency, inheritance or removal of restrictions; but it is expressly provided 'that nothing herein shall be construed so as to exempt any such property from liability for taxes.'\n The regulations issued under date of June 26, 1912, afford no support to the government's contention. They provide, among other things, that:\n\n\n (a)\n 'One who has not received a certificate of competency, but who has made good use of all moneys paid him and has properly used the lands and rentals under his control belonging to his minor children may be considered competent to handle his trust funds.'\n\n\n (b)\n In case of adults neither aged, physically disabled, nor incompetent to a degree reguiring legal guardianship, the applicant must agree 'to abide by a stipulation in the claim that the money is to be deposited in bank to his credit and expended under the supervision of the superintendent, subject to instructions from the Indian Office, if the Secretary of the Interior so directs.'\n Like the act under which they are framed, these regulations contemplate supervision of the expenditure of money, not control of the property, if any, for which the money is expended. They tend to confirm the contention of the appellant, that after the money is paid out of the bank it \n\n[246 U.S. 263, 271]\n\u00a0\n and property in which it may be invested are to be freed from any restriction. Under the Act of 1906, the Secretary of the Interior when applied to for a certificate of competency was confronted with serious alternatives. If he issued the certificate, all the allottee's surplus lands-about 495 acres5-would at one time be freed from restrictions on alienation and become subject to disposition by him without governmental If the Secretary refused to issue the certificate, the allottee would ( unless the certificate were granted later) remain, until the end of the twenty-five year period, in the enjoyment of the income merely; and at the end of that period, he or his heirs though unaccustomed to the control of property, would get absolute dominion at one time over the (a) homestead, ( b) surplus lands, (c) the trust fund ($3,928.50),6 and (d) his share of the interest in the oil, gas, coal and mineral rights. The Act of 1912 made possible the release of parts of the trust fund from time to time. The risks to be incurred at any one time could be made quantitatively as small as the Secretary of the Interior might deem advisable; and by the regulations, the risk was reduced in degree, by virtue of the requirement, that the money must be 'deposited in bank and expended under supervision of the superintendent, subject to instructions from the Indian Office, if the Secretary of the Interior so directs.' The policy of education and development through the bank account had been tried and found promising. \n7\n The regulations greatly exte ded \n\n[246 U.S. 263, 272]\n\u00a0\n the field of operation by providing that one legally incompetent might get such release where he had made good use of the moneys theretofore paid him or of the lands under his control. It is education through the responsibility for spending, not the property purchased with released moneys, which constitutes the instrumentality employed by the government in fitting the individual Osage Indian to take his full part as a citizen of the United States.\n Furthermore, in the case at bar it is not shown that the money released from the trust was invested directly in property restricted as to alienation. Apparently Panther's money had been released six months before the deed to him was executed and was used to pay for a conveyance of the land to Brenner, as trustee for Robert and Emma Panther. What the terms of the trust were does not appear. But there is nothing in the record to indicate that a restriction upon the alienation of the land was among them or that the Secretary of the Interior expressly reserved control over the property or its proceeds. It may well be that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs then believed that an ordinary trust of the property for a short period would best advance the interests of Panther. It is consistent with the facts shown that the restriction upon alienation inserted in the deed was not a continuation of control reserved by the Secretary of the Interior, but a bringing under his control of a part of Panther's estate theretofore freed. In this respect and others the present case differs from United States v. Thurston County, 143 Fed. 287, 74 C. C. A. 425, much relied upon by the government. There is also a clear distinction between the present case and those like United States v. Rickert, \n188 U.S. 432\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 478, where it was sought to tax property, the legal title of which was in the United States and which was held by it for the benefit of Indians. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[246 U.S. 263, 273]\n\u00a0\n While an Indian is still a ward of the nation, there is power in Congress even to reimpose restrictions on property already freed (Brader v. James, \n246 U.S. 88\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 285, 62 L. Ed. --, decided this day); but Congress did not confer upon the Secretary of the Interior authority to exercise such power under the circumstances of this case or to give to property purchased with released funds immunity from state taxation.\n The decree is reversed with directions to dismiss the bill.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Annual Reports, Dept.

PEOPLE OF STATE OF CAL.(1918)\nNo. 133\nArgued: April 26, 1918Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 91, 92]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William Sea, Jr., of Calexico, Cal., and Frederick S. Tyler, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. James M. Oliver, of San Francisco, Cal., for the People of State of California.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here to review a judgment of the Superior Court modifying and affirming as modified a judgment pronounced against plaintiffs in error (whom we shall call defendants) after a verdict of a jury finding them guilty of violating a law of the State entitled 'An act to regulate the sale and use of poisons in the State of California and providing a penalty for the violation thereof.' St. 1907, p. 124, as amended by St. 1909, p. 422, and St. 1913, c. 342, p. 692.\n The action was commenced by filing a verified complaint in a justice's court of the county charging them with having in their possession at Calexico in that county a preparation of opium containing more than two grains of opium to the fluid ounce, they, the defendants, not being within any of the exceptions of the statute.\n Their trial was by jury which returned a verdict of guilty against them, and, after motion for new trial made upon the rulings hereinafter stated and denied, judgment was entered fining each of them in the sum of $ 300, the imprisonment to be suspended during good behavior if the fine be paid. It was further adjudged that until the fine be paid each should be imprisoned in the county jail one day for each dollar of the fine not exceeding 180 days.\n On appeal to the Superior Court of the county the judgment was reversed as to imprisonment until the fine \n\n[247 U.S. 91, 93]\n\u00a0\n be paid; in all else affirmed. This writ of error was then allowed by the presiding judge.\n The case is in narrow compass. The charge was, as we have seen, that the defendants had opium in their possession in violation of the statute of the State. The defense was, among others, that the opium was in transit from St. Louis, Missouri, to Mexicali, Mexico. The latter town and Calexico are really but one, having, however, different names and being in different countries-the international boundary being a street.\n Necessarily the United States custom house is i Calexico, and to the practical singleness of the towns is added the fact that Wells Fargo & Company, the carrier of the drug from St. Louis, has its terminal in Calexico, and has the same office that the custom house broker has, whose relations with defendants were the subject of testimony and contention.\n It is clear, however, that the drug was shipped from St. Louis and could have been carried by Wells Fargo & Company no farther then Calexico and that the consignees could have paid-indeed, had to pay, and did pay- the express charges at that place, and could have received the drug upon payment. It is in dispute whether they did or whether one McCoy, the custom house broker, received it and weighed it, assisted by Young. The weighing, it was testified, was made necessary by the requirement of the law of Mexico. It was therefore a dispute of fact or inference in the case whether Young received the drug or MeCoy did as a customs officer and that Young did no more than assist in the preparation of the shipment to Mexico, not participating in the possession.\n In explanation of the situation Young testified that he did not remove the box (it was quite large and weighed, with contents, 72 pounds and, we may say in passing, was valued at $960.00) or take possession of it, arrange- \n\n[247 U.S. 91, 94]\n\u00a0\n ments having been made with McCoy to have the box taken to Mexicali, he, McCoy, being a common carrier. And he testified that McCoy weighed its contents. He was then asked the question if he knew why McCoy weighed the contents. The question was objected to as immaterial on the ground that it made no difference what the purpose of weighing the contents was. The objection was sustained and counsel for Young replied, 'We want to show that Mr. McCoy was to make out the American and Mexican papers for the expiration of the box to McGinis and Young at Mexicali.' The question was then put whether McGinis and Young had authority to export the opium that was seized. Again the attorney for the State objected, saying, 'It can have no bearing in this case. It is only a question of possession.' The objection was sustained, to which it was replied by defendants' attorney, 'If the court will not permit us to put in our defense as to having permission and authority to export the opium, cocaine and morphine mentioned in interstate and foreign commerce under the regulations of the Treasury Department of the United States, the defendants will rest.'\n A series of instructions were asked by defendants to be given which expressed the supremacy of Congress over interstate and foreign commerce and that therefore, even if defendants had control of the opium, if it was in transit or being transported from the United States to Mexico through a chain of carriers, then the defendants did not have possession of the opium in violation of the law of the State, and that it was the duty of the jury to acquit them. The instructions were refused.\n It is clear, therefore, that defendants asserted rights under the commerce clause of the Constitution and that the evidence ruled out as immaterial was offered to sustain them. It was certainly pertinent and the circumstances of the case and the evidence made it competent. In other words, there was a dispute as to whether defendants had \n\n[247 U.S. 91, 95]\n\u00a0\n taken possession of the opium-of which the jury were to be the judges, not the court-and whether the drug was in transit; and the conditions of transit were elements to be considered.\n The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCGINIS v.

Haven, both of San Francisco, Cal., for the People of the State of California. \n\n[247 U.S. 95, 96]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case was submitted with No. 133, \n247 U.S. 91\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 440, 62 L. Ed. --\n As in the latter case plaintiffs in error, whom we shall call defendants, were charged in a justice's court of Imperial county with having cocaine in their possession in a quantity forbidden by the statute of the state regulating the sale and use of poisons. After and verdict of guilty, there was judgment exactly the same as in No. 133, which judgment, after motion for new trial made and denied, and upon appeal to the Superior Court of the county, was modified, and as modified affirmed as in that case.\n The drug was shipped from St. Louis in the same box as the opium in case No. 133. The testimony in this case, however, as to its being in transit to Mexico is somewhat fuller. In addition to the exclusion of such testimony the defendants were prevented from showing permission from the Treasury Department to export a quantity of cocaine to Mexico. Such permission and the purpose of weighing the contents of the box were decided to be immaterial, possession alone being determinative of guilt.\n We think the rulings were error. But it is said that the error was without detriment to defendants; that the testimony showed that there were only 100 ounces of cocaine in the original package from St. Louis and that 85 ounces were added in the repacking. However, it is not shown from whence it came, and the trial of the case and the submission of it were based on the shipment from St. Louis. The judgment of the Superior Court was rendered in both actions and made no distinction between them. And, besides, McGinis was not shown to have had any connection with the 85 ounces, and we may remark that cross-examination as to the fact was, on the objection of the \n\n[247 U.S. 95, 97]\n\u00a0\n prosecution, prevented. We think, therefore, the error in excluding the testimony cannot be said to have been without detriment to defendants.\n The court was asked to instruct the jury as in No. 133 and refused. It gave, however, a number of instructions requested by the prosecution, some abstract, as to the extent of the police power of the state, and others directed to the effect of possession of the drug, if found by the jury, and its determination of defendants' guilt. We do not consider it necessary to comment upon them further than to say that they give emphasis to the rulings upon the testimony offered by the defendants.\n The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI, K. & T.

Looney and Mr. Luther Nickels, both of Austin, Tex., for the State of Texas.\n\n\n[245 U.S. 484, 487]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the State of Texas to recover penalties for violation of an order of the State Railroad Commission. This order required passenger trains in Texas to start from their point of origin and from stations on the line in accordance with advertised schedule, allowing them not exceeding thirty minutes at origin or points of junction with other lines to make connection with trains on such other lines, and not exceeding ten minutes more if at the end of the thirty minutes the connecting trains were in sight. There were some other qualifications not necessary to be stated. The defendant's passenger trains concerned were numbers 9 and 209, and were parts of a train, also numbered 9, of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway, a different corporation, taken charge of by the defendant at Denison, Texas, about five miles south of the Texas and Oklahoma State line, under a contract with the Missouri, Kansas & Texas. In pursuance of this contract they were forwarded via Dallas and Fort Worth to Hillsboro, thence as one train to Granger and there again divided, the two parts going respectively to Galveston and San Antonio. There were similar arrangements for trains to the north. The cars received by the defendant came from St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri, uniting at Parsons, Kansas, and thence proceeding south to Denison. The Court of Civil Appeals at first held that the movement must be regarded as a continuous one from Kansas City and St. Louis, and that the order did not apply to the train; but on a rehearing (167 S. W. 822) decided that as the defendant took control at Denison with new crews and engines, and as the defendant could not go beyond the State line, the movement so far as the defendant was concerned was wholly within the State. Breaches of the order having been proved, it affirmed a judgment imposing \n\n[245 U.S. 484, 488]\n\u00a0\n a fine. A writ of error was refused by the Supreme Court of the State.\n The Supreme Court gave up the manifestly untenable ground taken by the Court of Civil Appeals and recognized that the defendant's trains were instruments of commerce among the States, but it construed the order as applying to them none the less and held it valid as so applied. The only question with which we have to deal is whether the State Commission could intermeddle in this way, especially when there was sufficient accommodation for local traffic independent of the through trains. The defendant in error attempts to open this last matter, because the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals in which the fact was stated was reversed by it for a different reason, and that of the Court of first instance was the other way. But we regard the decision of the intermediate and the Supreme Court as proceeding upon the assumption that we have stated and that we see no reason to disturb. Again, the question is not what the State Commission might require of a road deriving its powers from the State, with regard to local business (Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 262, 283\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 330), but whether the order if applied to this case would not unlawfully interfere with commerce among the States.\n On its face the order as applied was an interference with such commerce. It undertook to fix the time allowed for stops in the course of interstate transit. It was a serious interference, for it made the defendant liable for an interstate train not starting on schedule time, when the train did not come into the defendant's hands, from another company in another State, until too late. This, as we understand the facts, was the train to which the advertised schedule applied, and if so, the mere statement of the result is enough to show that the burden imposed not only was serious but was unwarranted as well as unjust. The suggestion that compliance with the order \n\n[245 U.S. 484, 489]\n\u00a0\n could have been secured by having an extra train ready to run if the regular one was not on time hardly is practical, and is not an adequate answer, even in form. For the defendant advertised, or at least had the right to advertise, the interstate train, and, if it did so, would not free itself from liability for a delay on the part of that train by offering another. We think it plain that this order was applied in a way that was beyond the power of the Commission and Courts of the State. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Blackwell, \n244 U.S. 310\n, 37 Sup.

Smith, of Kansas City, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error brought suit in the circuit court of Jackson county, Missouri, to recover on certain tax bills issued to one Michael Walsh, its assignor, for the \n\n[246 U.S. 63, 64]\n\u00a0\n construction of a sewer in Kansas City, Missouri. The case was tried on an amended petition and answer. The amended petition was filed on May 20, 1909, but it is said the suit was begun on May 29, 1906. The amended petition set out that by an ordinance approved January 24, 1901, Kansas City provided a sewer district, and let a contract for the construction of the sewer to Walsh. That Walsh constructed the sewer, and was paid for the work by special tax bills against sewer district number 146 in Kansas City. That lot 1, block 1, C. H. Pratt's Vine Street addition, is located in said sewer district, and that at the time the work was done and the tax bills issued the owner of said property held the same subject to certain proceedings to condemn said lot for a public parkway in the South Park district of Kansas City established by an ordinance approved October 3, 1899; that said parkway ordinance ordered that said lot 1, block 1 and other property should be condemned for the urpose of a public parkway, and proceedings were begun in the circuit court of Jackson county, Missouri, for the condemnation of the lot for that purpose; that the condemnation proceedings were carried to judgment in the circuit court of Jackson county, Missouri, wherein a verdict had been rendered for the value of the property on June 4, 1901, that the verdict was duly affirmed, and judgment rendered on September 14, 1901, in the circuit court. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Missouri said judgment was suspended until affirmed by the Supreme Court, June 4, 1902, and that after that date the city paid for and took possession of said lot 1, block 1, Pratt's Vine Street addition, and now is holding the same for a public park. Plaintiff further alleges that, while the condemnation proceedings were pending in the Supreme Court, Walsh completed the work, and that tax bills therefor were issued to him on March 15, 1902, chargeable in payment of the appropriate share of the cost of the sewer upon the lot above \n\n[246 U.S. 63, 65]\n\u00a0\n described. The plaintiff alleges that Walsh sold and assigned the certificates or special tax bills to it; that by reason of the condemnation proceedings and the judgment therein the tax bill never became a lien upon the lot, above described, and that upon a final determination of said condemnation case Kansas City was liable to pay the amount of said tax bill with interest, and that the city cannot by an act of itself, not consented to by the plaintiff, either by judicial proceedings in the nature of condemnation or otherwise destroy plaintiff's right to collect the cost of the said work in accordance with the contract mentioned; the plaintiff invokes the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States guaranteeing the protection of its property by due process of law as against the acts of states. Plaintiff alleges that before the beginning of the suit it offered to surrender to the Board of Public Works of Kansas City the tax bills issued as aforesaid, and to accept a certificate as provided in the city charter in lieu thereof, if the board should hold that the said certificates or tax bills were not certificates conformable to the provisions of the charter of Kansas City, but the board refused to accept the same or to issue a new certificate, and denied all liability for the said charge.\n The city answered the amended petition, and stated therein that on March 15, 1902, it did issue special tax bills to Michael Walsh as set out in the petition; and that Walsh on March 15, 1902, executed and delivered to Kansas City a full and complete release on account of any claim arising on said tax bills as provided in section 16, article 9 of the charter of Kansas City. The answer further sets up that the charter of Kansas City provides a method by which the city shall pay its share of any public improvement on land owned in fee by it; that no certificate was issued by the city on the lot in question or any other lots described in the petition; and that it was not found that the lots mentioned in the petition were owned in fee sim- \n\n[246 U.S. 63, 66]\n\u00a0\n ple by the city; that there was no compliance with the charter of the city, and no obligation created thereunder.\n At the trial the tax bills sued upon were introduced, indorsed as follows: 'Assignment. For value received _____ assign this special tax bill and the lien thereof to Municipal Securities Corporation, and _____ authorize to sign _____ name-to the receipt. Michael Walsh.'\n The record does not disclose when this assignment was made, and it bears no date.\n Upon trial in the circuit court the court held as a matter of law that Kansas City was an agency of the state of Missouri, and had by its official acts, ordinances and conduct appropriated to the public use the property and property rights of the plaintiff consisting of valid and subsisting liens upon certain real estate without making just compensation, or any compensation therefor, and thereby deprived the plaintiff of ts property without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment and contrary to the Bill of Rights of the state of Missouri, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff.\n The case being taken to the Supreme Court of Missouri the judgment of the circuit court was reversed (265 Mo. 252, 177 S. W. 856) and the case was brought to this court because of an alleged violation of the protection afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment as the result of the alleged wrongful appropriation of the plaintiff's property. The Supreme Court of Missouri after reciting the facts, held that the suit was upon the tax bills, that as Walsh's agreement with the city and the ordinance itself provided that the city should not be liable to pay for the work or any part thereof otherwise than by the issue of special tax bills, and because the charter of the city provided that the city should in no event or in any manner be liable for or on account of the work done in constructing the sewer, but that the work should be paid for in special tax bills which would be a lien on the property described in them, \n\n[246 U.S. 63, 67]\n\u00a0\n and that under the Constitution of Missouri and the statutes of that state the use of municipal funds in the payment of tax bills was absolutely forbidden, there could be no recovery upon them, and in so far as recovery was sought because of the asserted conversion or destruction of the lien of the tax bills, the judgment for the plaintiff could not stand. Concerning this feature of the case the court said:\n'The suit here is upon a tax bill in some aspects and upon a tort as for conversion in others. The petition is sui generis, being possibly what is meant by learned counsel for plaintiff when they say of it in their brief that it is 'typical in form.'\n\n'We need not consider whether a recovery could have been had upon tort, as for the alleged conversion, or destruction, of the property upon which ordinarily the lien of the tax bills would have been fixed. The assignment is not of the tort, nor of the contract, nor of the right to recover upon a quantum meruit, but of the tax bill pure and simple, for it says: 'For value received _____ assign this special tax bill and the lien thereof to Municipal Securities Corporation,' etc. The lien assigned was upon the lots and not against defendant; but the law is fairly well settled that the title of the city to these lots for use as a street attached by relation back under the facts here to the date of the judgment confirming the verdict of the jury, to wit, September 14, 1901, a date long prior to the issuing of the tax bills, which were issued March 15, 1902. In re Paseo, 78 Mo. App. 518. The best that can be said for plaintiff's insistence touching this lien is that the lien of the tax bills attached conditionally to these lots; the condition of attachment being that the defendant would dismiss its condemnation case short of final judgment and payment of the money into court, as under the general law absent a charter provision forbidding, it had the right to do. State ex rel. v. Fort, 180 Mo. 97 [79 S. W. 167]; Rail- \n\n[246 U.S. 63, 68]\n\u00a0\n road v. Second Street Imp. Co., 256 Mo. loc. cit. 407 [166 S. W. 296]. The city did not so dismiss the proceeding and the right of the city, temporarily suspended, as we may express it, by the appeal, attached upon the affirmance here of the judgment of condemnation as of the date of such judgment (In re Paseo, supra), and had the effect to convert these lots of private persons, into integral parts of the highway, or street system of Kansas City, and to take them our of the category of property of private persons upon which liens of tax bills would attach; but since these lots became parts of public highways the judgment condemning them did not have the effect of converting them into that class of city property, the sewering of which created a liability against the city for which certificates evidencing such liability against the city were issuable by charter. Section 14, art. 9, Charter of Kansas City, 189 .\n\n If Walsh himself had sued for the tort of conversion alleged in effect by the briefs and contentions of counsel for plaintiff, a different and much more serious question would confront us; but it seems idle to insist that upon the petition here and upon the assignment above quoted, that plaintiff may recover upon the theory of tort. We have seen already how futile and idle is the view that plaintiff may recover upon contract. Moreover, no such tort is assigned. Nothing is assigned, but the tax bill and the lien thereof . ... But be this as may be, the point of peculiarity in the instant case that plaintiff cannot in any event recover upon any theory of contract, but that it must recover, if at all, upon the theory of liquidated compensation for a tort, which tort was not assigned to it, and on which it does not sue, destroys in our view any helpful analogy between the above cases from other jurisdictions and this one at bar.'\n As the matter above extracted from the opinion of the Supreme Court of Missouri shows, that court held the \n\n[246 U.S. 63, 69]\n\u00a0\n action to be on the assigned tax bills, and that if Walsh might have maintained a suit because of the wrongful taking of the property as alleged, nothing was assigned to the plaintiff in error but the tax bills and the lien thereof; and that the plaintiff could not maintain this action as one in tort because it did not appear to be the assignee of such right of action if one existed. It therefore follows that the Missouri Supreme Court rested its decision upon a ground of general law adequate to support it, independently of the decision upon alleged violation of federal right under the Fourteenth Amendment. In that situation it is well settled that a case from a state court is not reviewable here. Wood v. Chesborough, \n228 U.S. 672\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 706; Consolidated Turnpike Co. v. Norfolk & O. V. R.

It appears that they shipped on the American bark Rhine at Buenos Ayres, October 7, 1916, for a voyage to New York, at the rate of $25 per month. It is stipulated that the shipping of seamen on sailing vessels at Buenos Ayres is controlled by certain shipping masters, to one of whom the libelants, in ac cordance \n\n[248 U.S. 205, 212]\n\u00a0\n with the usual custom and as a means of securing employment, signed a receipt or advance note for one month's wages. These advance notes were presented to the American Vice-Consul at Buenos Ayres before the libelants signed the articles, were by him noted on the articles and, in the presence of the libelants, directed to be paid on account of the wages of the respective libelants. It was further stipulated that in directing the master of the Rhine to honor such advance notes, the Consul was acting in accordance with section 237 of the Consular Regulations of the United States. When the bark arrived at New York the libelants were paid the wages earned, less the $25 advanced. They now seek to recover the sum thus deducted, by virtue of the terms of section 10 (a), c. 121, Act June 26, 1884, 23 Stat. 55, as amended by Act March 4, 1915, c. 153,  11, 38 Stat. 1168 (Comp. St. 1916,  8323), entitled an 'Act to promote the welfare of American seamen in the merchant marine of the United States,' upon the theory that such advances are unlawful and of no effect.\n The facts in relation to the case of the barkentine Windrush differ from the above only in respect of the fact that the advance notes are not in evidence, but are noted on the articles.\n The District Court decided in favor of the libelants. 244 Fed. 833. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decrees. 250 Fed. 180. The cases are here on writs of certiorari.\n The section of the statute is the same as that involved in the case of The Talus (No. 392) \n248 U.S. 185\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 84, just decided. The difference is that the advances were made by the master of an American vessel in a South American port, whereas in The Talus the advancements were made to foreign seamen in a British port. The same general consideration as to the interpretation of the statute which controlled in the decision of the case of The Talus are applicable here and need not be repeated. $That American vessels might be controlled by con gressional \n\n[248 U.S. 205, 213]\n\u00a0\n legislation as to contracts made in foreign ports may, for present purposes at least, be conceded. It appears that only by compliance with the local custom of obtaining seamen through agents can American vessels obtain seamen in South American ports. This is greatly to be deplored, and the custom is one which works much hardship to a worthy class. But we are unable to discover that in passing this statute Congress intended to place American shipping at the great disadvantage of this inability to obtain seamen when compared with the vessels of other nations which are manned by complying with local usage.\n The statute itself denies clearance papers to vessels violating its terms. This provision could only apply to domestic ports and is another evidence of the intent of Congress to legislate as to advances made in our own ports.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, with whom concur Mr. Justice HOLMES, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n These cases were submitted with Nos. 361 and 392 (\n248 \nU.S. 182, 185\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 83, 84, 200), and, like them, are proceedings in admiralty under the Seamen's Act of 1915, 38 Stat. 1165-1168.\n The facts are set out in the opinion of the court. In these cases, as in others, we are constrained to dissent. The principle of decision should be, we think, that declared in our dissent in The Talus, \n248 U.S. 185\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 84. The facts of these cases put more tension upon it, that is, an adhesion to the words of the statute as determinative of its purpose rather than some of its consequences. We have here the somewhat appealing force of a picture \n\n[248 U.S. 205, 214]\n\u00a0\n of an American ship only able to escape practical internment in a foreign port by a violation of the law, if it be as we have declared it. And this under the sanction of the United States Consul acting under the following regulation of the Department of State:\n'237. Advances to Seamen Shipped in Foreign Ports.-The shipment of seamen in foreign ports cannot be considered as within the intention, and hence not within the proper construction of the act referred to in the next preceding paragraph [inserted in the margin].1 The final clause of the act, which declares that this section shall apply as well to foreign vessels as to those of the United States, and that in case of violation a clearance shall be refused them, is a clear indication that Congress did not in this section refer to the shipment of seamen in foreign ports, but had in view acts done in the United States alone. The provision of the statute as to payment of advance wages is not intended to apply to seamen shipped in foreign ports.' \n\n[248 U.S. 205, 215]\n\u00a0\n We are unable to assent. We regard the act of Congress as clear and that the theater of its injunction is the harbors of the United States. It is misleading to dwell upon the jurisdiction of other places, which is but another name for control. The jurisdiction, control, is in and by the United States and the command is that advances shall not be deducted from wages of seamen on vessels, American or foreign, while in the waters of the United States. Where they were made or under what circumstances made are not factors in judgment. They are the mere accidents of the situation and if they reach the importance and have the embarrassment depicted by counsel, the appeal must be to Congress, which no doubt will promptly correct the improvidence, if it be such, of its legislation. We have already expressed our view of the control of the language of the law and that it is a barrier against alarms and faultfinding.\n\n It hence follows that we are of opinion the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals in each case should be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '236. No Advance Wages.-Except in case of whaling vessels, it is not lawful to pay any seaman wages before leaving the port at which such seaman may be engaged in advance of the time when he has actually earned the same, or to pay such advance wages to any other person, or to pay to any one except an officer authorized by Act of Congress to collect fees for such service, any remuneration for the shipment of a seaman. If any such advance wages or remuneration shall have been paid or contracted for the Consul, in making up the account of wages due the seaman upon his discharge, will disregard such advance payment or agreement and award to the seaman the amount to which he would be entitled if no such payment or agreement had been made. Nor should Consuls permit the statute to be evaded indirectly, as by part payment in advance and then stating rate of wages too small. R. S. Secs. 4532, 4533; 23 Stat.

Ferguson, Jr., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Nelson a civil engineer who had been in the employ of the Southern Railway eleven years, was directed to make a survey in one of its yards. While doing so he walked on the main track between the rails where he had seen others walk. As he stepped upon a cross-tie, a small V-shaped piece of it one and a half inches by six, being rotten, slivered off under his weight. His foot slipped down between the ties where the ballast was five or six inches below the top of the tie; and stumbling, he fell and disloc ted his knee. The defect in the tie could have been discovered by sounding with an iron rod and the standard of maintenance of roadbed prescribed by the Railway was to ballast to the top of the ties. But neither the condition of the tie, nor the failure to ballast to the top of the tie, was a defect of a character to impair safety in operation. Plaintiff knew that there were always some ties on the line which were partly decayed, and also that the ballast was occasionally below the top of the ties.\n Upon these facts Nelson sought in a state court of North Carolina to recover damages from the Railway \n\n[246 U.S. 253, 255]\n\u00a0\n under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (Act April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 [Comp. St. 1916,  8657-8665]). The trial court refused defendant's motion for a non-suit; and the jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff. Judgment thereon was reversed by the Supreme Court of the State ( 170 N. C. 170, 86 S. E. 1036) on the ground that there was no evidence of negligence; and the case came here on writ of error.\n It is clear that the defendant did not fail in any duty which it owed to the plaintiff.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW ORLEANS & N.

Thompson, of Jackson, Miss., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Thomas G. Fewell, of Meridian, Miss., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n While employed in interstate commerce by plaintiff in error, a common carrier by railroad then engaging in such commerce, Van Harris a brakeman was run over by the tender of an engine moving in the yard at New Orleans, Louisiana-February 5, 1914. He died within a few minutes without regaining consciousness. Having qualified as administratrix, his mother (defendant in error), charging negligence and relying upon the federal Employers' Liability Act, sued for damages in a state court for Lauderdale county, Mississippi. A judgment in her favor was affirmed by the Supreme Court without opinion. \n\n[247 U.S. 367, 369]\n\u00a0\n The declaration contained no averment of conscious pain or suffering by deceased. It alleged:\n'That by reason of the negligence hereinabove set out, the defendant railroad company is liable for the killing of said Van Harris and the administratrix is given the right to sue by the act of Congress, she therefore brings this, her suit, and demands judgment against the defendant for the sum of ten thousand dollars.'\n\n It further charged that the dead son had been his mother's sole support but contained no reference to his widow.\n One witness who claimed to have seen the accident gave evidence tending to show negligence by the railroad; but his presence at the scene was not left free from doubt and other eyewitnesses narrated the circumstances differently. Concerning deceased's contributions to his mother's support, she said he was her sole dependence, paid her house rent, gave her something to eat, looked after her, was regularly at work and would bring home $30 or $40 a month. Her statements are the only evidence concerning the son's marriage and widow. He duly married Mollie on an undisclosed date; after living together for six months he fell ill and she left; thereafter her whereabouts were unknown to him; she was alive at time of trial (October, 1914); he left no child. Nothing indicates a divorce proceeding. Answering 'Do you know whether Mollie ever married anybody else or not?' the witness replied: 'I don't know, sir; I hear them say she married.'\n Upon request of the administratrix, the following instructions (among others) were given to the jury:\n'No. 1. The court charges the jury for the plaintiff in this case that under the rule of evidence in the state of Mississippi all that is required of the plaintiff in this case is to prove that injury was inflicted by the movement of the defendant's train or engine and then the law presumes negligence and then the burden of proof shifts to the \n\n[247 U.S. 367, 370]\n\u00a0\n defendant to prove all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the injury and from those facts so shown exonerate itself from all negligence.\n\n'No. 2. The court charges the jury for the plaintiff that under the rule of evidence under the Mississippi statutes known as the prima facie statute all that the plaintiff need prove to entitle her to a judgment or verdict is that the defendant's engine or train caused the injury complained of and then the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict at the hands of the jury unless the defendant has shown all of the facts surrounding the injury and from such facts has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that its servants were not guilty of negligence.\n\n'No. 3. The court charges the jury for the plaintiff that if you believe from the evidence that deceased was injured by the running of defendant's engine, then the burden placed on defendant by the prima facie statute cannot be met or overcome by mere speculation or conjecture, but it devolves on defendant the duty of showing by a preponderance of the evidence all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the injury and by such proof thus exonerate itself from negligence.'\n\n'No. 8. The court charges the jury for the plaintiff in this case that if your verdict shall be for the plaintiff then it should be in such sum as you may believe from the evidence would fully compensate the deceased for his pain and suffering, if any have been shown by the evidence, and the value of his life reckoned according to the American Mortality Table had the deceased survived and that such amount or the measure of same is peculiarly within the province of the jury reckoned as avove outlined. And that the law does not require the plaintiff to prove the damages in dollars and cents but the amount thereof is to be fixed by the jury in all not to exceed the sum of ten thousand dollars.'\n\n The so-called 'Prima Facie Act' of Mississippi, set \n\n[247 U.S. 367, 371]\n\u00a0\n out below,1 provides that in actions against railroads for damages proof of injury inflicted by an engine propelled by steam shall be prima facie evidence of negligence. Relying upon and undertaking to apply this statute, the trial court gave the quoted instructions, and in so doing, we think committed error.\n The federal courts have long held that where suit is brought against a railroad for injuries to an employe resulting from its negligence, such negligence is an affirmative fact which plaintiff must establish.

The deceased left a widow and although they had lived apart no claim is made that rights and liabilities consequent upon marriage had disappeared under local law.

She alleged: That plaintiff in error, a New York corporation, had long maintained local offices and carried on the business of life insurance in Missouri, where she and her husband resided; that in 1900, at St. Louis, he applied for and received the policy, she being named as beneficiary; that premiums were paid to October 20, 1907, when the policy lapsed, having then a net value, three-fourths of which, less 'indebtedness to the company given on account of past premium payments' applied as required by the Missouri nonforfeiture statute (section 7897), sufficed to extend it beyond assured's death. Further, that upon application by assured and herself presented at St. Louis the company there made him loans amounting, October 20, 1907, to $1,350, but of this only $599.65 had been applied to premiums. She asked judgment for full amount of policy less loan, unpaid premiums, interest, etc.\n Answering, the company admitted issuance of policy, but denied liability because assured borrowed of it, November 1906, at its home office, New York City, $1,350, hypothecating the policy there as security, and then failed to pay premium due October 20, 1907, whereupon in strict compliance with New York law and agreements made there the entire reserve was appropriated to sat- \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 366]\n\u00a0\n isfy the loan, and all obligation ceased. The assured being duly notified offered no objection. It further set up that as the loan, pledge and foreclosure were within New York the federal Constitution protected them against inhibition or modification by a Missouri statute, and, if intended to produce such result, section 7897, Rev. Stats. Mo. 1899, lacked validity.\n In reply, defendant in error denied assent to alleged settlement, maintained all transactions in question took place in Missouri, and asserted validity of its applicable statutes.\n The Springfield Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment for $2,233.45- amount due after deducting loan, unpaid premiums, etc. 189 S.

It declared former opinions of the state Supreme Court conclusively settled the constitutionality of section 7897, and that the reserve, after paying advances for premiums was thereby appropriated to purchasing term insurance, notwithstanding any contrary agreement.

Being duly licensed by that state, plaintiff in error, responding to an application signed by Josiah B. Dodge at St. Louis, issued and delivered to him there a five thousand dollar twenty-year endowment policy upon his life, dated October 20, 1900, naming his wife beneficiary but reserving the right to designate another. Among other things, it stipulated:\n'Cash loans can be obtained by the insured on the sole security of this policy on demand at any time after this policy has been in force two full years, if premiums have been duly paid to the anniversary of the insurance next succeeding the date when the loan is made. Application for any loan must be made in writing to the home office of the company, and the loan will be subject to the terms of the company's loan agreement. The amount of loan available at any time is stated below, and includes any previous loan then unpaid. Interest will be at the rate of five per cent. per annum in advance.'\n\n Continuation after failure to pay premium was gu ranteed, also reinstatement within five years. It further provided:\n'Premiums are due and payable at the home office, \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 369]\n\u00a0\n unless otherwise agreed in writing, but may be paid to an agent producing receipts signed by one of the above-named officers and countersigned by the agent. If any premium is not paid on or before the day when due, or within the month of grace the liability of the company shall be only as hereinbefore provided for such case.' 'Any indebtedness to the company, including any balance of the premium for the insurance year remaining unpaid will be deducted in any settlement of this policy or of any benefit thereunder.'\n\n By an application addressed to the company at New York accompanied by a loan agreement, both signed at St. Louis and 'forwarded from Missouri Clearing House branch office, August 29, 1903,' together with pledge of the policy-all received and accepted at the home office in New York City- the assured obtained from the company a loan of $490. Its check for the proceeds drawn on a New York bank and payable to his order was sent to him at St. Louis by mail. Annually thereafter the outstanding loan was settled and a larger one negotiated-all in substantial accord with plan just described. The avails were applied partly to premiums; the balance went directly to assured by the company's check on a New York bank.

Bayard, Cashier.\n The premium due October 20, 1907, not being paid, the company applied entire reserve in discharge of insured's indebtedness as provided by laws of New York and sent him by mail the following letter:\n New York, December 17th, 1907.\n Mr. Josiah B. Dodge, 4952 Maryland Ave., St. Louis, Mo.\n Re Policy No. 2054961.\n Dear Sir: By a loan agreement executed on the 8th day of November, 1906, the above policy on the life of Josiah B. Dodge was pledged to and deposited with the New York Life Insurance Company as collateral security for a cash loan of $1,350.00.\n The premium and interest due on said policy on the 20th day of October, 1907, not having been paid, the principal of said loan became due and has been settled according to the terms of the policy, and the policy has no further value.\n Yours truly,\n John C. McCall, Secretary, by E. M. C.\n This was received by assured December 19, 1907, and neither he nor the beneficiary, during his life, offered objection to the action taken.\n That the policy when issued to Dodge became a Missouri contract, subject to its statutes, so far as valid and applicable, is undisputed and clear. The controlling doctrine in that regard was announced and applied in Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Clements, \n140 U.S. 226\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 822, New York Life Ins. Co. v. Cravens, \n178 U.S. 389\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 962, and Northwestern Life Insurance Co. v. Riggs, 203 U. S. \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 373]\n\u00a0\n 243, 27 Sup. Ct. 126, 7 Ann. Cas. 1104. In each of those cases the controversy related to the interpretation and effect of an original policy-not a later good faith agreement between the parties. We held that to the extent there stated the state had power to control insurance contracts made within its borders. With those conclusions we are now entirely content; but they do not rule the question presently presented. Here the controversy concerns effect of the state statute upon agreements between the parties made long after date of the policy and action taken thereunder; their essential fairness and accordance with New York laws are not challenged.\n Considering the circumstances recited above, we think competent parties consummated the loan contract now relied upon in New York where it was to be performed. And, moreover, that it is one of a kind which ordinarily no state by direct action may prohibit a citizen within her borders from making outside of them. It should be noted that the clause in the policy providing 'cash loans can be obtained by the insured on the sole security of this policy on demand, etc.,' certainly imposed no obligation upon the company to make such a loan if the Missouri statute applied and inhibited valid hypothecation of the reserve as security therefor as defendant in error maintains. She canno , therefore, claim anything upon the theory that the loan contract actually consummated was one which the company had legally obligated itself to make upon demand.\n In Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 U.S. 578\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 427, we held a Louisiana statute invalid which undertook to restrict the right of a citizen while within that state to place insurance upon property located there by contract made and to be performed beyond its borders. We said, 'The mere fact that a citizen may be within the limits of a particular state does not prevent his making a contract outside its limits while he himself remains within it,' and ruled \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 374]\n\u00a0\n that under the Fourteenth Amendment the right to contract outside for insurance on property within a state is one which cannot be taken away by state legislation. So to contract is a part of the liberty guaranteed to every citizen. The doctrine of this case has been often reaffirmed and must be accepted as established. Nutting v. Mass., \n183 \nU.S. 553, 557\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 238; Delamater v. South Dakota, \n205 \nU.S. 93, 102\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 447, 10 Ann. Cas. 733; Provident Savings Ass'n v. Kentucky, \n239 \nU.S. 103, 114\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 34, L. R. A. 1916C, 572; Adams v. Tanner, \n244 \nU.S. 590, 595\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 662, L. R. A. 1917F, 1163, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 973.\n The court below rested its judgment denying full effect to the loan agreement upon Smith v. Mut. Ben. Life Ins. Co., supra, and Burridge v. Insurance Co., supra. In them the Supreme Court distinctly held section 7897 controlling and the insurer liable upon policies actually issued in Missouri notwithstanding any subsequent stipulation directing different disposition of reserve after default. In the latter it expressly approved the doctrine of the first and, among other things (211 Mo. 171, 109 S. W. 564), said:\n'Attending to that section [No. 7897] as it read when the policy issued and when the insured died, it will be observed that the net value of the policy is to be computed. Then from three-fourths of such net value there is to be taken away-what? All indebtedness? Not at all. There shall be taken away 'any motes or other evidence of indebtedness to the company, given on account of past premium payments on said policies.' The residue, if any, then goes automatically to the purchase of temporary or extended insurance . ... In that [the Smith] case, therefore, the scope and meaning of that clause of our non-forfeiting insurance statute was held in judgment in the stiffest sense and this court decided that the statute was mandatory; that the character of the indebtedness to be deducted from the net value before applying the residue to the purchase of temporary or extended in- \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 375]\n\u00a0\n surance must be looked to and was limited by the clear words of the statute 'to notes or other evidences of indebtedness to the company, given on account of past premium payments' on the policy issued to the insured; and did not include notes and evidences of indebtedness arising in other ways. It is not apparent, assuming the statute be constitutional, how, giving heed to the hornbook maxim, expressio unius, etc., any other conclusion could have been arrived at in reason. It was held furthermore, in effect, that such provisions of law evidenced a sound and just governmental policy, and wrote into every policy of life insurance, coming within its purview, a mandate not to be abrogated in whole, or hedged about or lopped off in detail, by policy provisions, nor to be contracted away otherwise than as prescribed by statute.'\n\n Treating the loan to Dodge as made under a New York agreement which Missouri lacked power directly to control, the question presented becomes similar in principle to the one decided in New York Life Insurance Co. v. Head, \n234 U.S. 149\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 879. There suit was instituted in Missouri upon a policy personally applied for and received while in that state by a citizen of New Mexico. Nine years afterwar s, having duly acquired the policy in New Mexico, the transferee wrote from there to the insurer in New York and effected a loan under an agreement like the one now before us. The state courts held the policy a Missouri contract and the loan agreement controlled by its non-forfeiture statute.\n Assuming the policy to be a Missouri contract, we declared that state without power to extend its authority over citizens of New Mexico and into New York and forbid the later agreement there made simply because it modified the first one. We said:\n'It would be impossible to permit the statutes of Missouri to operate beyond the jurisdiction of that state and in the state of New York \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 376]\n\u00a0\n and there destroy freedom of contract without throwing down the constitutional barriers by which all the states are restricted within the orbits of their lawful authority and upon the preservation of which the government under the Constitution depends.'\n\n The reasoning advanced by the Missouri Supreme Court to support its ruling was thus summarized:\n'As foreign insurance companies have no right to come into the state and there do business except as the result of a license from the state and as the state exacts as a condition of a license that all foreign insurance companies shall be subject to the laws of the state as if they were domestic corporations, it follows that the limitations of the state law resting upon domestic corporations also rest upon foreign companies and therefore deprive them of any power which a domestic company could not enjoy, thus rendering void or inoperative any provision of their charter or condition in policies issued by them or contracts made by them inconsistent with the Missouri law.'\n\n And this argument we declared unsound since the--\n'proposition cannot be maintained without holding that because a state has power to license a foreign insurance company to do business within its borders and the authority to regulate such business, therefore a state has power to regulate the business of such company outside its borders and which would otherwise be beyond the state's authority-a distinction which brings the contention right back to the primordial conception upon which alone it would be possible to sanction the doctrine contended for, that is, that because a state has power to regulate its domestic concerns, therefore it has the right to control the domestic concerns of other states.'\n\n Under the laws of New York, where the parties made the loan agreement now before us, it was valid; also it was one which the Missouri Legislature could not destroy or prevent a citizen within its borders from making \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 377]\n\u00a0\n beyond them by direct inhibition; and applying the principles accepted and enforced in Insurance Co. v. Head, we think the necessary conclusion is that such a contract could not be indirectly brought into subjection to statutes of the state and rendered ineffective through a license authorizing the insurance company there to do business. As construed and applied by the Springfield Court of Appeals, section 7897 transcends the power of the state. To hold otherwise would permit destruction of the right-often of great value-freely to borrow money upon a policy from the issuing company at its home office and would, moreover, sanction the impairment of that liberty of contract guaranteed to all by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n A statute of Missouri (Rev. Stats. 1899,  7897) prohibited life insurance companies authorized to do business within the state from forfeiting a policy for default in the payment of premiums, if three full years' premiums had been paid thereon. The act provided further that in case of such default the policy should be automatically extended and commuted into paid-up term insurance. And it determined mathematically the length of the term, as that for which insurance could, at a rate prescribed, be purchased with a single premium equal in amount to three- fourths of the reserve or net va ue less any indebtedness to the company 'on account of past premium payments.' The obligation imposed upon the company by this statute, as construed by the highest court of the state, could not be modified by contract with the insured whether entered into at the time the policy was written or subsequently. Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Clements, \n140 U.S. 226\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 822; Smith v. Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co., 173 Mo. 329, 72 S. W. 935. Such non- forfeiture laws are an exercise \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 378]\n\u00a0\n of the police power; and, as insurance is not interstate commerce, the state's power in this respect is as great over foreign as over domestic corporations. Orient Insurance Co. v. Daggs, \n172 \nU.S. 557, 566\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 281; New York Life Insurance Co. v. Cravens, \n178 \nU.S. 389, 401\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 962; Northwestern Life Insurance Co. v. Riggs, \n203 U.S. 243\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 126, 7 Ann. Cas. 1104.\n In 1900 Dodge, a citizen and resident of Missouri, applied in that state to the New York Life Insurance Company, a New York corporation, for a policy on his life in favor of his wife. The policy was delivered to the assured in Missouri where the company had an office and was authorized by the Missouri statute to do business; and there the first and later premiums were paid and, until his death, Dodge and the beneficiary lived and the company continued so to do business.\n In 1906 Dodge entered into a supplemental agreement with the company by which he nominally borrowed $1,350, pledged his policy as collateral, and agreed that, in case of default in repaying the loan, the company might discharge it by applying thereto the reserve of the policy. In 1907 Dodge made default in payment both of the premium and of the loan. The reserve of the policy was then less than the amount due on the whole loan; but three-fourths of the reserve exceeded that part of the loan which had been applied to the payment of past premiums by $275.79. This excess, if applied in commutation for term insurance, would have extended the policy to December 23, 1912. The company claimed the right to use the whole of the reserve to astisfy the whole of the loan, so to satisfy the whole of the loan, so 17, 1907, that its obligation on the policy ceased. Dodge died February 12, 1912. The beneficiary, insisting that by reason of the Missouri statute the policy was still in force when her husband died, brought suit thereon in a state court of Missouri and recovered judgment, which was affirmed by the Springfield Court of Appeals (189 \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 379]\n\u00a0\n S. W. 609), and the Supreme Court of the state refused a review. The case comes here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code. \n1\n The company asserts that the loan agreement was made in New York, and relying upon New York Life Insurance Co. v. Head, \n234 U.S. 149\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 879, contends that the state court, in denying full effect to that contract, deprived it of liberty, property, and equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n First. Was the loan agreement in fact made in New York?\n The policy was confessedly a Missouri contract. Dodge, so far as appears, was never out of Missouri. Physically every act done by Dodge and the beneficiary in connection with the loan agreement, as with the policy, was done in Missouri: (a) They signed there the application for the loan. ( b) They signed there the loan agreement. (c) They signed there the request upon the company to pay itself, out of the $1,350 nominally borrowed, the amount of an earlier loan with interest to October, 1907, and of the premium. (d) He delivered there (at the Missouri Clearing House branch office) the policy given as collateral and these three papers, which were forwarded by that office November 9, 1906, and received in New York three days later. (e) He paid there the balance of the premium, $116.40 in cash; for the sum of $1,350, nominally adv nced then, was insufficient to pay off the then existing loan with interest and the accrued premium. Throughout these transactions the company was authorized to do business in Missouri and was, in these transactions, actually doing business there. International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 U.S. 579\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 944.\n Nothing was done in New York then except this: The papers received from the Missouri Clearing House branch office were examined and filed in the home office; and \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 380]\n\u00a0\n certain calculations and appropriate entries in the books and on the papers were made there. No money was paid then to Dodge. The nominal advance was less than the amount, including accrued premium, then due by him to the company; and Dodge balanced the account by paying in Missouri $ 116.40. In 1903, when a similar loan agreement was made, the nominal amount of the loan exceeded the sum due for premiums by $486.91; and a check for that sum was drawn by the company in New York and sent by mail from there to Dodge in Missouri. In 1904 a further check for $92.10 was sent from New York by the company to Dodge under a similar loan agreement. Under the 1903 agreement the policy was delivered to the company and it had remained in the company's possession at the home office. But when the loan agreement here in question was made, nothing was done in New York except to examine and file the papers and to make the calculations and entries. No discretion was exercised there by the company's official. By the terms of the policy the company had already assented to the amount nominally advanced as a loan and to the rate of interest to be charged. The functions exercised by the officials at New York were limited to determining whether the calculations were correct and whether papers were properly executed and filed.\n These acts so done by the company at its home office in connection with the loan agreement were similar in character to those performed when the policy was written. The application for the policy addressed to the company at its home office was likewise delivered at the Missouri Clearing House and forwarded to the home office. The application was considered and accepted in New York. The policy was executed there. It provided that the premiums and the insurance should be payable there. But such acts did not prevent the policy being held to be a Missouri contract. Equitable Life Assurance Society \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 381]\n\u00a0\n v. Clements, supra; Northwestern Life Insurance Co. v. McCue, \n223 U.S. 234\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 220, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 57. Even if the loan agreement be treated as an independent contract, it should, if facts are allowed to control, be held to have been made in Missouri. But the loan agreement was not an independent contract; nor is it to be treated as a modification of the original contract. It was an act contemplated by the policy and was subsidiary to it, as an incident thereof. What was done by the officials at the home onice was not making a New York contract, but performing acts under a Missouri contract.\n Second. What is the effect of the provision in the loan agreement that it shall be deemed to have been made in New York?\n The provision 'that the application for said loan was made to said company at its home office in the city of New York, was accepted, the money paid by it, and this agreement made and delivered there; that said principal and interest are payable at said home office, and that this contract is made under and pursuant to the laws of the state of New York, the place of said contract being said home office of said company' is inoperative. For acts essential to the making of any agreement involving a pledge of the policy were done by Dodge, by the beneficiary, and by the company's agent in Missouri and were subject to the prohibition of a statute of that state which prevented the operation there of inconsistent New York laws. If the laws of Missouri and of New York had left the parties free to contract insurance on such terms as they ple sed, they might with effect have elected to be bound by the law of the state of their preference, whatever the place of the contract; in doing so, they would in effect have specified terms of the contract. But provisions in contracts for incorporating the laws of a particular state are inoperative, so far as the law agreed upon is inconsistent with the law of the \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 382]\n\u00a0\n state in which the contract is actually made. Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hill, \n193 \nU.S. 551, 554\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 538; Knights of Pythias v. Meyer, \n198 U.S. 508\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 754. Where the validity of a provision is dependent upon the place in which the contract is made, the actual facts alone are significant. Persons resident in Missouri, who enter there into a contract which is specifically controlled by the laws of that state, cannot, by agreeing that a modification inconsistent with the requirements of the Missouri law shall be deemed to have been made elsewhere, escape the prohibition of the Missouri statute. The fact that one of the parties to the contract is a corporation and hence capable of having a residence also in another state, and that some acts in connection with the contract were done by it there, does not affect the result. The company although a foreign corporation, was, for this purpose, a resident of Missouri, or at least, was present in Missouri. Barrow Steamship Co. v. Kane, \n170 U.S. 100\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 526; Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Actien-Gesellschaft, etc., 1 K. B . (1902) 342.\n Third. Even if the rules ordinarily applied in determining the place of a contract, required this court to hold, as a matter of general law, that the loan agreement was made in New York, it would not necessarily follow that the Missouri statute was unconstitutional, because it prohibited giving effect in part to the loan agreement. There is no constitutional limitation by virtue of which a statute enacted by a state in the exercise of the police power is necessarily void, if, in its operation, contracts made in another state may be affected. Emery v. Burbank, 163 Mass. 326, 39 N. E. 1026, 28 L. R. A. 57, 47 Am. St. Rep. 456; Hervey v. Rhode Island Locomotive Works, \n93 U.S. 664\n. The test of constitutionality to be applied here is that commonly applied when the validity of a statute limiting the right of contract is questioned, namely: Is the subject-matter within the reasonable scope of regulation? Is the end \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 383]\n\u00a0\n legitimate? Are the means appropriate to the end sought to be obtained? If so, the act must be sustained, unless the court is satisfied that it is clearly an arbitrary and unnecessary interference with the right of the individual to his personal liberty. Here the subject is insurance; a subject long recognized as being within the sphere of regulation of contracts. The specific end to be attained was the protection of the net value of insurance policies by prohibiting provisions for forfeiture; an incident of the insurance contract long recognized as requiring regulation. The means adopted was to prescribe the limits within which the parties might agree to dispose of the net value of the policy otherwise than by commutation into extended insurance; a means commonly adopted in non- forfeiture laws, only the specific limitation in question being unusual. The insurance policy sought to be protected was a contract made within the state between a citizen of the state and a foreign corporation also resident or present there. The protection was to be afforded while the parties so remained subject to the jurisdiction of the state. The protection was accomplished by refusing to permit the courts of the state to give to acts done within it by such residents (Dodge did no act elsewhere), the effect of nullifying in part that non-forfeiture provision, which the Legislature deemed necessary for the welfare of the citizens of the state and for their protection against acts of insuring corporations. The statute does not invalidate any part of the loan; it leaves intact the ordinary remedies for collecting debts. The statute merely prohibits satisfying a part of the debt out of the reserve in a manner deemed by the Legislature destructive of the protection devised against forfeiture. The provision may be likened to homestead and exemption laws by which creditors are limited in respect to the property out of which their claims may be enforced. When the New York Life Insurance Company sought and ob- \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 384]\n\u00a0\n tained permission to do business within the state, and when the policy in question and the loan agreement were entered into, this statute was in existence and was of course known to the company. It has no legal ground of complaint, when the Missouri courts refuse to give to the loan agreement effect in a manner and to an extent inconsistent with the express prohibition of the statute. The significance of the fact that this suit was brought in a Missouri court must not be overlooked. See Bond v. Hume, \n243 U.S. 15\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 366; Union Trust Co. v. Grosman, \n245 U.S. 412\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 147, 62 L. Ed.--.\n New York Life Insurance Co. v. Head, supra, furnishes no support for the contention made by the company here. The facts differ widely in the two cases. There the insured was not a citizen or resident of Missouri and does not appear ever to have been within the state except at the time when the application was made and the policy delivered. Here the insured was at all times a citizen and resident of the state. There the insured had assigned the policy to his daughter, who was a citizen of New Mexico and, so far as appears, had never been within the state of Missouri. Here the insured remained the owner of the policy. There the loan agreement was made by the assignee, a stranger to the policy; and the assignment being accepted and acted upon by the company resulted in a novation of the contract. Here the loan agreement was made by the insured. There every act in any way connected with the loan agreement, whether performed by the company or by the assignee (the insured performed none) was performed in some state or territory other than Missouri. Here every act was performed in Missouri except as above stated. If this court had held constitutional the statute of Missouri as construed by its Supreme Court in that case, it would have sanctioned, not regulation by a state of the insurance of its citizens, but an arbitrary interference by one state with the rights \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 385]\n\u00a0\n of citizens of other states. On the other hand, to sustain the contention made by the company in this case, would deny to a state the full power to protect its citizens in respect to insurance, a power which has been long and beneficently exercised. For the power to protect will be seriously abridged, if it is held that the state of Missouri cannot constitutionally prohibit those who are its citizens and corporations within its jurisdiction, from contracting themselves out of the limitations imposed by its Legislature, in the exercise of the police power, upon the contracts actually made within the state. And unless it is so abridged, the Missouri non-forfeiture law, as applied to the facts of this case, cannot be held invalid.\n Nor does Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 U.S. 578\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 427, furnish support to the company's contention. Allgeyer, a citizen and resident of Louisiana had made in New York, with a corporation organized and doing business there, an open contract for marine insurance to cover cotton to be purchased and shipped. Shipments to be covered were required to be reported by letter addressed to the company at New York. Allgeyer mailed in Louisiana such a letter addressed to New York City. A Louisiana statute made it a crime for any one to do any act to dffect insurance in any marine insurance company which had not established a place of business within the state and appointed an authorized agent upon whom process might be served. The insurance company there referred to had not been authorized to d business in Louisiana and actually did no business there. Allgeyer was sentenced for mailing the letter. This court held that the statute was unconstitutional as construed by the state court, because it denied to a citizen of the United States rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n But the case did not require the court to decide, whether a state could prohibit its citizens from making contracts with corporations organized under the laws of and doing \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 386]\n\u00a0\n business in another state; nor whether the contract there involved had been made in New York; nor whether it was valid. And it did not in fact decide any of those questions; for they were not in issue. It was admitted ( a) that the contract there involved-the open insurance policy-had been made in New York and (b) that it was valid. The only question presented to this court was, whether the state, in order more effectually to enforce its foreign corporations act, could prohibit its citizens from doing, within the state, certain acts which were essential to the enjoyment of rights secured by such a valid contract made without the state. In the paragraph near the close of the opinion (\n165 U.S. 593\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 432) this is pointedly expressed:\n'In such a case as the facts here present the policy of the state in forbidding insurance companies which had not complied with the laws of the state from doing business within its limits cannot be so carried out as to prevent the citizen from writing such a letter of notification as was written by the plaintiffs in error in the state of Louisiana, when it is written pursuant to a valid contract made outside the state and with reference to a company which is not doing business within its limits.'\n\n The more elaborate discussion which preceded this paragraph makes clear the ground of the decision.\n'In the case before us the contract was made beyond the territory of the state of Louisiana, and the only thing that the facts show was done within that state was the mailing of a letter of notification, as above mentioned, which was done after the principal contract had been made.' \n165 U.S. 587\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 430.\n\n'... In this case the only act which it is claimed was a violation of the statute in question consisted in sending the letter through the mail notifying the company of the property to be covered by the policy already delivered. We have then a contract which it is conceded was made \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 387]\n\u00a0\n outside and beyond the limits of the jurisdiction of the state of Louisiana, being made and to be performed within the state of New York, where the premiums were to be paid and losses, if any, adjusted. The letter of notification did not constitute a contract made or entered into within the state of Louisiana. It was but the performance of an act rendered necessary by the provisions of the contract already made between the parties outside of the state. It was a mere notification that the contract already in existence would attach to that particular property. In any event, the contract was made in New York, outside of the jurisdiction of Louisiana, even though the policy was not to attach to the particular property until the notification was sent.' \n165 U.S. 588\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 431.\n\n'... It was a valid contract, made outside of the state, to be performed outside of the state, although the subject was property temporarily within the state. As the contract was valid in the place where made and where it was to be performed, the party to the contract upon whom is devolved the right or duty to send the notification in order that the insurance provided for by the contract may attach to the property specified in the shipment mentioned in the notice, must have the liberty to do that act and to give that notification within the limits of the state, any prohibition of the state statute to the contrary notwithstanding. The giving of the notice is a mere collateral matter; it is not the contract itself, but is an act performed pursuant to a valid contract which the state had no right or jurisdiction to prevent its citizens from making outside the limits of the state.' \n165 U.S. 592\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 432.\n\n Fourth. Furthermore, the right of citizens of the United States which the Allgeyer Case sustained 'is the liberty of natural, not artificial persons.' Northwestern Life Insurance Co. v. Riggs, supra, \n203 U.S. 255\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 126, 7 Ann. Cas. 1104. While a state may not ( except in the reasonable exercise of the police \n\n[246 U.S. 357, 388]\n\u00a0\n power) impair the freedom of contract of a citizen of the United States, 'it can prevent the foreign insurers from sheltering themselves under his freedom.' Nutting v. Massachusetts, \n183 \nU.S. 553, 558\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 238; Phoenix Insurance Co. v. McMaster, \n237 U.S. 63\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 504. The insurance company cannot be heard to object that the Missouri statute is invalid, because it deprived Dodge of rights guaranteed to natural persons, citizens of the United States.

Kline, of Cleveland, Ohio, John C. Weadock, of New York City, and W. T. Holliday, of Cleveland, Ohio, for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Frank N. Sweitzer, Hubert C. Pontius, and A. Talmage Snyder, all of Canton, Ohio, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company through successive assignments from William A. Lynch acquired the interurban electric railroad between Canton and Massillon, Ohio, October, 1906; the Cleveland Trust Company is trustee under a mortgage on the road intended to \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 576]\n\u00a0\n secure an issue of bonds. The line was constructed under resolution by the board of county commissioners, Stark county, passed February 22, 1892, which granted to William A. Lynch, and such railroad corporation as he might cause to be incorporated for that purpose, the right to locate, construct, maintain and operate an electric railroad along the state highway without specifying any limit of time. This resolution is copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[245 U.S. 574, 577]\n\u00a0\n A disagreement concerning rates having arisen, by resolution of March 27, 1912, the commissioners declared the original grant to Lynch not a perpetual franchise but subject to termination by either party and that the passenger rate was excessive and should be reduced. It continued:\n'Therefore, be it resolved, that unless said Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company comply with the above-mentioned matters of reduction of amount of fare charged for transporting people between the cities of Canton and Massillon and from intermediate points, together with the transfer on the city lines of Canton and Massillon, on or before the 27th day of April, 1912, the said grant given to said William A. Lynch on February 22, 1892, to operate an electric railroad between the said cities of Canton and Massillon is hereby declared terminated and the prosecuting attorney of this county is hereby instructed to take such legal proceedings as may be necessary to have said grant made null and void \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 578]\n\u00a0\n and the said electric railway removed from said public highway between the said cities of Canton and Massillon.'\n\n April 26, 1912, the commissioners returning to the matter resolved:\n'In the event that demands are not met by the said company on or before the time mentioned in the said resolution of March 27th, 1912, the prosecuting attorney of this county be and he is hereby instructed to immediately proceed to have injunction proceedings filed against said Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company restraining said company from operating said electric railway on the public highways between the cities of Canton and Massillon or running cars thereon and to further compel said Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company to remove said electric railway from said public highway, and, be it further resolved, that this resolution be contingent upon and in accordance with the conditions of the said resolution passed by this board on March 27th, 1912. ...'\n\n Accordingly, August 13, 1912, Charles Krichbaum, prosecuting attorney, instituted quo warranto proceedings in the circuit court asking that plaintiff in error Traction & Light Company be ousted from exercising the franchise to operate a railroad along the Canton-Massillon highway, and be compelled to remove its tracks and switches. A demurrer was sustained because (1) the petition did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; (2) it did not state facts sufficient to justify relief prayed; (5) plaintiff had no legal power to try or bring the action. No appeal was taken from a final judgment entered June 3, 1913\n\n\n February 19, 1913, the commissioners adopted another resolution which, after referring to the one of 1892 and the construction and operation of the railroad, stated that the grant continued from day to day so long as both parties consented and could be terminated at will, and then \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 579]\n\u00a0\n declared 'that said term of said grant and conveyance be terminated on this date.' It is in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[245 U.S. 574, 580]\n\u00a0\n Obeying this last resolution, Hubert C. Pontius, prosecuting attorney, instituted the proceeding under review in the Supreme Court of Ohio. The petition alleged control of the railway by the Traction & Light Company; set up resolutions of 1892 and 1913 authorizing its contruction and directing removal; and declared the company continued operations 'which said conduct plaintiff avers is without warrant or authority of law.' It concluded:\n'Wherefore, because of the premises and matters herein \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 581]\n\u00a0\n set forth, the plaintiff prays the advice of the court, and that the defendant, to wit, the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company be compelled to answer by what warrant it claims to have the use and to enjoy the rights, privileges and franchises aforesaid, in the operation of its said interurban electric railroad between the cities of Canton and Massillon, ohio, in said county and state; and that it be ousted from exercising the same and be compelled to remove its tracks and switches from the said Canton-Massillon road between the corporate limits of the said cities of Canton and Massillon, and plaintiff further prays that such other and further relief be granted in the premises as to the court may seem just and proper.' \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 582]\n\u00a0\n The answer relied upon final judgment in proceedings instituted by Krichbaum as an adjudication of the grant's validity; also a resolution by the ounty commissioners May 3, 1909, providing for double-tracking as recognition and continuation of original franchise. And further:\n\n'This defendant says that said resolution of February 22, 1892, and said amending resolution of May 3, 1909, by the acceptance thereof by this defendant and its predecessors in title, constitute a contract between the board of county commissioners of Stark County, Ohio, and this defendant, and that any ouster of this defendant from its use and operation of said electric railroad between Canton and Massillon would be an impairment of the obligation of this defendant's contract, and a taking of the defendant's property without due process of law, and would also be a denial to this defendant of the equal protection of the law, all in violation of the Constitutions of Ohio and of the United States.'\n\n Without opinion or other explanation the Supreme Court pronounced the following decree October 19, 1915:\n'This cause came on to be heard on the pleadings and the evidence and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, the court finds upon the issues joined in favor of the plaintiff on the authority of Gas Co. v. City of Akron, 81 Ohio St. 33, 90 N. E. 40, 26 L. R. A. (N. S.) 92, 18 Ann. Cas. 332. It is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that the said defendant be ousted from the exercise and use of the rights, privileges, and franchises described in the petition of the plaintiff in the operation of the interurban electric railroad therein described, and it is hereby ordered to remove its tracks and switches from the said Canton and Massillon road between the corporate limits of the said cities of Canton and Massillon within ninety days from this date. It is further ordered and adjudged that the plaintiff recover of the defendant its costs herein, taxed at $_____.'\n\n Dissenting, three members declared:\n'The sole ques- \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 583]\n\u00a0\n tion in this case as presented is whether the board of county commissioners can revoke and annul a franchise granted by the state without having the power so to do delegated to it by the sovereign authority.' 93 Ohio St. 466, 114 N. E. 53.\n\n Plaintiffs in error maintain that the commissioners' resolution dated February 19, 1913, was an exercise of state authority repugnant to the federal Constitution, because it impaired their contract, took their property without due process of law, and denied them equal protection of the laws.\n In East Ohio Gas Co. v. City of Akron (decided October, 1909) 81 Ohio St. 33, 90 N. E. 40, 26 L. R. A. (N. S.) 92, 18 Ann. Cas. 332, relied upon to support the judgment below, a city ordinance, without specifying anything as to duration, provided 'that the East Ohio Gas Company, its successors and assigns, are hereby granted the right to enter upon the streets, alleys and public grounds of the city of Akron, Ohio, ... to maintain, operate, repair and remove mains and pipes ... together with the right to construct and maintain, repair and remove all necessary regulators,' etc. And the court said (81 Ohio St. pp. 52, 53, 90 N. E. 40, 42 [126 L. R. A. (N. S.) 92, 18 Ann. Cas. 332]):\n'It is true that the ordinance grants the right to enter and occupy the streets, but in respect to the time when it shall terminate its occupancy and withdraw, the ordinance is silent. May we infer from this silence that the gas company has a perpetual franchise in the streets? We are not now prepared to hold that the company has thus acquired such a perpetual franchise. ... It comes then to this, that in the absence of limitations as to time, the termination of the franchise is indefinite and, to preserve mutuality in the contract, the franchise can continue only so long as both parties are consenting thereto.'\n\n The Supreme Court determined, in effect, that a valid franchise to construct and maintain the railroad granted to Lynch and his successors in 1892 was terminated by resolution of 1913. Accepting this ruling, is the latter resolution inoperative and void because in conflict with \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 584]\n\u00a0\n article 1,  10, of the federal Constitution? Manifestly it amounted to action by the state. St. Paul Gas Light Co. v. St. Paul, \n181 \nU.S. 142, 148\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 575; Ross v. Oregon, \n227 \nU.S. 150, 163\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 220, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 224.\n It is suggested that in 1892 Ohio statutes only empowered county commissioners to grant franchises not exceeding twenty-five years in duration, and the present one accordingly expired in February, 1917. But by its final judgment (1915) the Supreme Court recognized a valid franchise existing in 1913 and declared it ended by the resolution of that year without discussing the subject of limitation. Consideration of the point is therefore unnecessary-our concern is with rights struck by the resolution. We express no opinion as to whether those have now expired. Neither are we concerned with the General Assembly's reserved power to revoke or repeal privileges; it has taken no action. Ohio Constitution ( 1851) art. 1,  2, and article 13,  2.\n Beyond serious doubt, under constitution and statutes of Ohio in 1892 county commissioners had power to grant franchises over public roads valid for twenty-five years, if not perpetually. Nothing said by the state courts prior to Gas Co. v. Akron (1909) is cited which intimates that grants, without specified limit of time, were revocable at will. Evidently this was not the settled view in 1903 when the circuit court distinctly adjudged that accepted ordinances by a city between 1861 and 1873, authorizing construction and operation of street railways, silent as to time, created perpetual rights, subject however to revocation by the General Assembly. State ex rel. v. Columbus Ry. Co. (1903) 1 Ohio Cir. Ct. R. (N. S.) 145. This judgment was affirmed in 1905, 73 Ohio St. 363, 78 N. E. 1139, 'on the sole ground that the defendant had present right to occupy the streets at the time of the commencement of this action'-a result hardly intelligible upon the theory that the grants were revocable at will. Appar- \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 585]\n\u00a0\n ently the doctrine announced in Gas Co. v. Akron, was not suggested in either court.\n The circumstances surrounding the grant of 1892 shows no intention either to give or accept a mere revocable right. It would be against common experience to conclude that rational men wittingly invested large sums of money in building a railroad subject to destruction at any moment by mere resolution of county commissioners. Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' St. Ry. Co., \n184 \nU.S. 368, 384\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 410.\n Where there are no controlling provisions in state Constitution or statutes and no prior adjudication by its courts to the contrary, we have distinctly held that franchises like the one under consideration are contracts not subject to annulment as here undertaken. Louisville v. Cumberland Telephone Co., \n224 \nU.S. 649, 664\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 572; Grand Trunk Western Ry. v. South Bend, \n227 \nU.S. 544, 556\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 303, 44 L. R. A. (N.

Ct. 967.\n As construed by the Supreme Court of Ohio the resolution of 1913 impaired a valid contract, upon which plaintiffs in error properly relied. It was accordingly invalid and without effect.\n The judgment below is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice DAY took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n The parties to this suit are a board of commissioners of an Ohio county and two corporations organized under the law of the same state, and the jurisdiction of this court, if it exists at all, must be found in the claim that the resolution of the county commissioners of February 19, 1913, is a law of the state of Ohio which impairs the ob- \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 586]\n\u00a0\n ligation of the grant by he commissioners of February 22, 1892, within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States. This resolution, printed in the margin of the court's opinion, declares that the commissioners 'contend' that the term of the grant of February 22, 1892, 'is an indeterminate one, continuing from day to day, and that said term extends and continues only so long as both parties to said grant ... agree and consent' and that it may be terminated at any time by either party to it. The resolution then declares the grant terminated as of the date of the resolution and that the prosecuting attorney of the county be, and he is, directed to take such steps as he may deem necessary to prevent further operation of the railroad on the highway, as provided for by the grant.\n The effect of the decision by the Supreme Court of Ohio is that this 'contention' of the county commissioners that the grant is one determinable at the will of either party to it, is sound and that the commissioners having elected to terminate it the rights of the railway company were at an end. This court reverses this decision of the State Supreme Court and holds that the grant of 1892 was not revocable at will by the county commissioners, that the resolution of February 19, 1913, in terms revoking it is invalid and void, and without deciding whether the power of the commissioners was limited to the granting of such a franchise for twenty-five years and if so whether the grant has expired the court returns the case to the state courts for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion.\n It is impossible for me to concur in the conclusion thus arrived at by the court and my reasons for dissenting will be briefly stated.\n The resolution of February 19, 1913, is in terms simply an expression of the 'contention' of the county commissioners as to the legal effect of the grant of 1892, coupled \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 587]\n\u00a0\n with notice of their election to terminate the same agreeably to their interpretation of it and with direction and authority given to the prosecuting attorney of the county to test in the courts the validity of the position asserted by the board.\n That such a resolution to apply to the courts of the country to establish an asserted legal right, is not a law impairing the obligation of a contract is expressly decided, it seems to me, in Des Moines v. Des Moines City Railway Co., \n214 U.S. 179\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 553, and in principle in Defiance Water Co. v. Defiance, \n191 U.S. 184\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 63. A resolution such as was passed here is the only form in which the board of county commissioners could assert, in advance of litigation, its contention as to its rights under the contract and it is not different in effect from what it would have been if the same contention had been expressed in another form, such as by way of an answer filed in behalf of the commissioners in a suit brought by the companies to enforce what they considered to be their rights under the grant. The decision of this court that the obligation of the contract was thus impaired amounts to holding 'that whenever it is asserted on the one hand that a municipality (county) is bound by a contract to perform a particular act and the municipality denies that it is liable under the contract, thereby an impairment of the contract arises in violation of the Constitution of the United States, but this amounts to the contention that every case involving a controversy concerning a municipal contract is one of federal cognizance, determinable ultimately in this court.' This court in the language quoted has declared such a conclusion to be obvious error in St. Paul Gas Light Co. v. St. Paul, \n181 \nU.S. 142, 149\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 575.\n These three clear and well-reasoned cases seem to me to correctly decide that the court is without jurisdiction to consider this case and that it should be dismissed. \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 588]\n\u00a0\n But even if we should assume that this court has jurisdiction to decide the case, it, nevertheless, would be impossible for me to concur in the conclusion arrived at.\n The resolution of the county commissioners under discussion does not, in words, define the term for which the franchise to operate a railroad on the public highway is to continue. The Supreme Court of Ohio holds that it results from this failure to define 'in express terms,' 'in plain terms,' the duration of the grant that it should be considered an indeterminate one, but this court holds that this failure to clearly define the duration of the grant results in its being a perpetual one, unless it be otherwise limited by constitution or statute.\n The rule for the construction of grants such as we have here will nowhere be found more clearly or imperatively stated than in the decisions of this court.\n In Blair v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 400, 463\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 427, a decision obviously rendered upon 'great consideration,' it is declared that a corporation which would successfully assert a private right in a public street must come prepared to show that it has been conferred 'in plain terms,' 'in express terms,' and that any ambiguity in the terms of the grant must be resolved in favor of the public and against the corporation, 'which can claim nothing which is not clearly given.' The sound reason given for this rule is that 'grants of this character are usually prepared by those interested in them,' and that 'it serves to defeat any purpose, concealed by the skillful use of terms, to accomplish something not apparent on the face of the act.' This is declared to be 'sound doctrine which should be vigilantly observed and enforced.'\n The Supreme Court of Ohio is not less definite in adopting the same rule of construction, saying, in Railroad Co. v. Defiance, 52 Ohio St. 262, 40 N. E. 89:\n'Every grant in derogation of the right of the public in the free and unobstructed use of the streets ... \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 589]\n\u00a0\n will be construed strictly against the grantee and liberally in favor of the public and never extended beyond its express terms when not indispensable to give effect to the grant.'\n\n What results from the application of this rule to the grant we are considering?\n The fact that two such courts as this one and the Supreme Court of Ohio differ so widely that the one holds the grant on its face to be perpetual, and the other holds it to be determinable at will, is, to me, convincing evidence that a perpetual grant is not conferred 'in plain terms,' 'in express terms,' that it is 'something not apparent on the face of the grant,' and that, therefore, to give such a construction to the resolution is to find in it a most vital and important provision which 'those interested' in obtaining the grant would have been eager to incorporate into it had they thought it possible to obtain consent to it. It is impossible for me to doubt that a proposal to the county commissioners to make the resolution read 'Resolved, that the right is hereby granted ... to construct, maintain and operate perpetually an electric railroad ... on the state road between Canton and Massillon' would have been summarily rejected by the commissioners. The public indignation which the making of such a grant would have excited was sufficient protection against its being made 'in plain terms' and the rule we have quoted, in my judgment, should be the protection of the public against such a result being accomplished by construction.\n The Supreme Court of Ohio may have been influenced in its decision of this case by the fact that from the time when the development of the state became such as to make of public importance the terms of grants of street railway rights in the streets and public roads of that state, the General Assembly of the state limited to twenty-five years the term for which such rights might be granted, either \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 590]\n\u00a0\n by county commissioners or by municipal corporations. It is difficult for a man living in such a legal atmosphere with respect to such grants to think in terms of perpetual franchises. An attempt to remove this restriction f om grants by county commissioners was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Railway Co. v. Railway Co., 5 Ohio Cir. Ct. R. (N. S.) 583, affirmed 73 Ohio St. 364, 78 N. E. 1122.\n The decision of this case by the Supreme Court of Ohio is without written opinion, but it is rested by the court upon its previous decision in the East Ohio Gas Co. v. Akron, 81 Ohio St. 33, 90 N. E. 40, 26 L. R. A . (N. S.) 92, 18 Ann. Cas. 332. In that case the city of Akron contended that the franchise granted to the Gas Company, in terms unrestricted as to time, was perpetual, and the Gas Company contended that it was determinable at the will of either party. After having the case under advisement for six months, and as the court says in its opinion 'on account of its great importance to the public as well as to all public service corporations' having given unusual consideration to the case, the contention of the Gas Company was sustained and the grant was held 'simply determinable, existing only so long as the parties mutually agree thereto.' Paragraph three of the syllabus of the case, which in Ohio has the approval of the entire court, reads:\n'While much regard will be given to the clear intention of the parties, yet where the contract is entirely silent as to a particular matter, the courts will exercise great caution not to include in the contract by construction, something which was intended to be excluded.'\n\n This decision was rendered in 1909 by a unanimous court, and six years later it was made authority for the decision of this case. There is no Supreme Court authority in Ohio to the contrary. The judgment by an inferior court (State ex rel. Taylor v. Columbus R. Co., 1 Ohio Cir. Ct. R . [N. S.] 145), cited in the majority opinion, that street railway grants made before the statutory limit of twenty-five years was imposed and silent as to duration were perpetual, was \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 591]\n\u00a0\n promptly discountenanced when the case reached the Supreme Court. Id., 73 Ohio St. 363, 78 N. E. 1139.\n A decision by a state Supreme Court, repeated after the lapse of six years, of a question involving the construction of local laws is, in my judgment, entitled to very great weight.\n There was no question raised in the Ohio court but that a contract was created by the passing and accepting of the resolution of 1892, and the record shows that the sole question for decision, and which was decided, was, whether the grant was an indeterminate or a perpetual one. If the grant had contained an express provision that it was revocable at will, it would have been impossible, having any regard to the meaning of words, to have said that the resolution of 1913 impaired its obligation. It would have been simply and only a form of exercising a legal right the exercise of which was contemplated by the contract. The case is not different if the grant, without such expression, really means, as the Supreme Court of Ohio held that it means, the same thing as if such provision had been incorporated into it, and since the state court arrived at its result by the construction of the grant wholly unaffected by the subsequent resolution terminating it, it seems clear enough, upon repeated decisions of this court, that a decision should not be rendered here based on the theory that the grant was impaired by a resolution in form terminating it. While this court has held that in such cases it will for itself determine whether a contract exists and what its terms are, yet where the decision of the state court is so manifestly unaffected by the later 'law' as it is in this case, it should be given weight and authority comparable at least to that which would have been given it if it had been directed to the validity of the granting 'law' under the state Constitution.\n The power to declare laws of states unconstitutional and to reverse the judgments of the Supreme Courts of \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 592]\n\u00a0\n states is so fateful and is so unprecedented in the history of governments other than ours that, as this court has repeatedly declared, it should be exercised only in cases which are clear, and it is impossible for me to think that this is such a case.\n The only reason given by the court in its opinion for differing with the Supreme Court of Ohio in its construction of the granting resolution of 1892 is that:\n'The circumstances surrounding the grant of 1892 show no intention either to give or accept a mere revocable right. It would be against common experience to conclude that rational men wittingly invested large sums of money in building a railroad subject to destruction at any moment by mere resolution of county commissioners.'\n\n There is no evidence whatever in this record that there were any special circumstances 'surrounding the grant of 1892,' and to undertake to infer what the unexpressed intention of the parties to this grant was twenty-five years ago is, it seems to me, an unusual and unpromising enterprise.\n That it would be against common experience to conclude that rational men would wittingly invest their money in a railroad constructed under a grant determinable by the action of county commissioners is reasoning which it seems is more persuasive with courts than with investors or men of affairs. To reason upon what is reasonable is always uncertain and often misleading, but in this case we have ascertained facts to guide us.\n Until recent years street railroad franchises (locations), and also electric light, gas, and other public utility franchises were revocable in Massachusetts, by aldermen in cities, and by selectmen in towns (counties), and they are still in the main so revocable, save that as to railroad grants revocation is now subject to approval by the state Railroad Commission, and as to some other 'locations' revocation is subject to approval by the Board of Gas and \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 593]\n\u00a0\n Electric Light Commissioners. Mass. Rev. Laws, 1902, vol. 2,  7, 32, pp. 1044, 1051. Springfield v. Springfield St. Ry. Co., 182 Mass. 41, 48, 64 N. E. 577; Boston Electric Light Co. v. Boston Terminal Co., 184 Mass. 566, 6 N. E. 346; Metropolitan Home Telephone Co. v. Emerson, 202 Mass. 402, 88 N. E. 670. Yet hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in that state in dependence upon these revocable ordinances.\n In legislating for the District of Columbia, Congress has followed the Massachusetts example and has made street railroad grants indeterminate and revocable at the will of Congress. Act May 17, 1862, c. 73, 12 Stat. L.  6, p. 390; Act July 29, 1892, c. 322, 27 Stat. L.  8, p. 334.\n Wisconsin, in 1907, adopted the principle of indeterminate franchises ( Laws of Wisconsin, 1909, p. 775,  1797t-2), and the new Constitution of Michigan recognizes it by providing that any franchise not revocable at will shall require the affirmative vote of sixty per cent. of the voters before it can become valid. Constitution, 1908, art. 8,  25. Wilcox Municipal Franchises, vol. 1, pp. 36, 37, vol. 2, pp. 46, 47, and chapter 27.\n This form of franchise has been called 'a tenure during good behavior,' it has resulted in superior service to the public and, to the surprise of those who reason a priori on the subject, such franchises have proved in effect perpetual. This type of franchise is undergoing modification in various parts of the country, which will, no doubt, improve it, but, of it even as it now is, Wilcox has this to say:\n'Unquestionably, with the recognition of the unspeakable wrong that is inherent in the grant of perpetual franchises, and the great practical disadvantages that usually arise in connection with limited- term grants, public sentiment is rapidly crystallizing in favor of the indeterminate franchise as the most promising basis for public control of street railways.' Municipal Franchises, vol. 2, p. 240. \n\n[245 U.S. 574, 594]\n\u00a0\n Perpetual franchises have proved to be such a burden in communities upon which they have been imposed (Wilcox, vol. 2, c. 26) that, for the reasons so well stated in Blair v. Chicago, supra, it is impossible for me to agree that any grant is perpetual unless the language used i it is so express and clear that reasonable men cannot differ in giving to it that effect.\n\n Thus for the reasons (1) that a perpetual grant is not 'in plain terms' made by the resolution of 1892; (2) that appropriate consideration seems to me not to be given to the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio; and (3) that the reasons stated for inferring that an irrevocable franchise was intended by the granting power in the case before us are not sound reasons, I should dissent from the opinion of the court even if convinced that it had jurisdiction to decide the case.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Resolution for Right of Way for Electric Railway.\n'Resolved, that the right is hereby granted to William A. Lynch and to such railroad corporation as he may cause to be incorporated for that purpose to locate, construct, maintain and operate an electric railroad along either side of the state road running between Canton and Massillon, between the line of the Canton Street Railway and the corporate limits of the city of Massillon, said road to be constructed of ties and rails in the customary manner with the necessary poles and wires for an electric railroad. The ties shall not be laid nearer to the center line of said road than nine feet, except where switches are constructed, at which places the present traveled driveway may be slightly changed from its location to allow for the construction of such switches. Wherever cutting or filling may be necessary in order to establish a suitable grade for said railroad, and such cutting or filling encroaches upon the traveled portion of said road, or nearer than nine feet from the center of the road or wherever the cut or fill would interfere with the usefulness or safety of the road, at all such places the grade of the road shall be changed and its bed shall be regraveled so as to restore it to its present state of usefulness, instead of locating said railroad on one side of the center line as above provided, the same may be located, along the center line of said road, along the whole or any portion thereof provided that in such case wherever so located said railroad company, or the property owners along the road shall cause a good and sufficient roadway to be graded on each side of said railroad, each of said roadways to be not less than sixteen feet wide in cuts and not less than eighteen feet wide on fills, and each roadway shall be graveled to a width of ten feet and eight inches in thickness and put in condition for public travel without unreasonable delay. In case the railroad is built upon the side of the road, crossings shal be constructed of plank or other suitable materials, at all public highway crossings or intersections and in front of all private driveways on the side of the road on which said railroad may be located. If the railroad be constructed in the center of the road, the track shall be laid so that the ties shall not be above the level of the highway on either side at the ends of the ties, materially, or so as to prevent the crossing of teams and vehicles over said railroad with reasonable convenience. All work that may be done under this resolution upon and along said state road shall be done under the supervision and subject to the control and to the approval and acceptance of the commissioners, they reserving the right to make such minor changes in location and the plans and methods of grading the highway as th public interests may require. It being understood and agreed that said Wm. A. Lynch or the railroad company, before commencing any part of said work shall enter into a bond in the sum of ten thousand dollars for the faithful performance of the conditions enjoined upon them by this resolution. This resolution to be of no binding effect until such bond is duly executed and accepted. It being further understood and agreed that said Wm. A. Lynch or the railroad company before commencing any part of said work shall enter into a bond in the sum of ($5,000) five thousand dollars conditional that said Wm. A. Lynch or said railroad company shall keep said county and said board perfectly harmless from any and all liability to abutting property owners growing out of the construction of said road.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Resolution of the County Commissioners of Stark County, Ohio.\n Whereas, the county commissioners of Stark County, Ohio, on the 22d day of February, 1892, passed a resolution appearing on pages 17, 18, and 19 of volume 8, Commissioners' Journal, Stark County, Ohio, and said resolution is as follows: [Here follows a copy of the resolution granting a right of way to Lynch above set out.] and,\n Whereas, an electric interurban railway, some time after the passage of said resolution, was built and constructed from Canton, Ohio, to Massillon, Ohio, upon the state road between said cities, the course described in the aforesaid resolution, and\n Whereas, cars are now being operated upon said interurban electric railway and have been so operated for some years, by persons or companies, claiming to derive their rights and title from the said William A. Lynch, and claiming that their said title, right and interest emanate from the aforesaid resolution, and\n Whereas, the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company, a corporation, is now and has been, for several years last past, operating the interurban electric cars over said railway and carrying passengers over said interurban electric railway between the cities of Canton and Massillon, Ohio, and\n Whereas, the said the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company claims its rights, interests and privileges for the conducting of said business as assignee, transferee and successors of the said William A. Lynch, and his assigns or successors, based and founded upon the aforesaid resolution passed by the county commissioners of Stark counry, Ohio, on the 22d day of February, 1892, and recorded on pages 17, 18 and 19 of volume 8, Commissioners' Journal, Stark county, Ohio, and\n Whereas, the commissioners of the county of Stark and state of Ohio contend,\n First. That the said William A. Lynch, at the time of the enactment of said resolution of the commissioners of Stark county, was not an incorporated company and was not entitled to the privileges of which a company incorporated in Ohio for the purpose of owning and operating an interurban electric line, was not such an entity that he could accept the interests, rights and titles granted by the county commissioners of Stark county in the aforesaid resolution.\n Second. That whatever right, title, interest and privilege, if any, were conveyed by the aforesaid resolution to the said William A. Lynch \n were conveyed and granted to the said William A. Lynch and to him alone, said grant and conveyance being a personal one.\n Third. That the term of the grant included in the aforesaid resolution of the county commissioners, passed by the county commissioners on the 22d day of February, 1892, as aforesaid is an indeterminate one, continuing from day to day and that said term extends and continues only so long as both parties to said grant and conveyance, to wit: Stark county, Ohio, through its board of county commissioners, the grantor, and William A. Lynch, or any company he might organize and incorporate, or any successor of the said William A. Lynch or the said company he might organize, the grantee, agree and consent, and that said grant and conveyance can be terminated at any time by either party to said grant or conveyance, or those claiming to hold or holding under said grant.\n Now, therefore, be it resolved by the board of commissioners of Stark county, Ohio, assembled in session, that said term of said grant and conveyance be terminat d on this date, to take effect on this date, and that the board of commissioners of Stark county, Ohio, refuse to extend to the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company, which company claims to hold, title, right and interest as the successor, assignee and transferee of the aforesaid William A. Lynch and his successors and assignees, or either of them, the term for the operation of the aforesaid interurban electric railroad beyond this date.\n Be it resolved that the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company be notified that the commissioners of Stark county, Ohio, have on this date terminated the term of said grant and conveyance, under which said grant the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company claim the right and privilege of operating said interurban electric railroad between Canton and Massillon, Ohio, and that the county of Stark and state of Ohio and the board of commissioners of Stark county, Ohio, will regard and do regard the operation of an interurban electric rail- \n road between Canton and Massillon, Ohio, on said state road running between Canton and Massillon, Ohio, from this date forward a usurpation and infringement upon the rights of said Stark county, Ohio, and said board of commissioners of said Stark county, Ohio.\n Be it resolved that the prosecuting attorney of Stark county, Ohio, be directed and is hereby directed to take whatever steps he may deem necessary and advisable to prohibit and prevent the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company or any other person, individual, corporation or company from continuing to operate an interurban electric railroad between the cities of Massillon and Canton, Ohio, on the state road, running between said cities by virtue of any rights, title or interest the said the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company or any other person, individual, corporation or company may claim as resulting from the aforesaid resolution, enacted by the county commissioners of Stark county, Ohio, on February 22, 1892.\n Be it resolved that the said the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company be directed and is hereby directed to remove all its property, equipment and belongings from the right of way described by the aforesaid resolution, herein referred to as having been passed by the county commissioners of Stark county, Ohio, on February 22, 1892, and now occupied by the said the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company, at once.\n Be it resolved that a copy of this resolution be sent or delivered, and the auditor of Stark county, Ohio, is hereby directed to send or deliver to the Northern, Ohio Traction & Light Company a copy of this resolution. \n\n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN PAC. RY. CO. v. SOLUM(1918)\nNo. 205\nArgued: March 19, 1918Decided: June 10, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles Donnelly and C. W. Bunn, both of St. Paul, Minn., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[247 U.S. 477, 478]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry C. Flannery, of Minneapolis, Minn., and Lyndon A. Smith, of St. Paul, Minn., for defendant in error Solum.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These three cases were heard together. In each of them the plaintiff below sought to recover from the Northern Pacific Railway Company, in a state district court of Minnesota, an amount equal to that by which the freight collected for coal carried on an interstate route from Duluth to some other city in the state, exceeded the rate prescribed by the Minnesota law for carriage between those points on another route, wholly within the state. In each case judgment was entered in the trial court for the plaintiff for such amount; and the judgments were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota. Each case comes here on writ of error.\n Carlton is situated on the orthern Pacific Railway, west of Duluth. Between these Minnesota cities that company operates two lines of railroad, each mainly single track. The northerly line, about 20.9 miles in length, lies wholly within Minnesota; the southerly line, 27.5 miles in length, extends for 11.7 miles through Wisconsin. The southerly is the original Northern Pacific line which was built in 1885. It has relatively light grades. The northerly line was built by the St. Paul & Duluth Railroad Company and came under the management of the Northern Pacific in 1900. It has a heavy upgrade from Duluth to Carlton. Since 1900 both lines have been operated continuously by the Northern \n\n[247 U.S. 477, 479]\n\u00a0\n Pacific. Because of these grades, the northerly route has been used almost exclusively for such Duluth shipments as are in-bound and the southerly route has been used for such as are out-bound. Until June, 1907, the rates were the same over the two routes They were duly filed with the Minnesota Railroad and Warehouse Commission and with the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n In 1907 the Legislature of Minnesota fixed for intrastate carriage of coal, maximum rates which were lower than the published rates theretofore charged. The rates so fixed were to take effect June 1, 1907; but before that date their enforcement was enjoined by the proceedings which were reviewed in the Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 U.S. 352\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A. 18. This injunction remained in effect until July, 1913, when it was dissolved pursuant to that decision. Until then the Northern Pacific continued to charge the published rates (and therefore the same rates) on all shipments of coal from Duluth to Minnesota points, whether moving via the interstate route or the intrastate route. After dissolution of the injunction, the company refunded on the few shipments which had moved over the intrastate route, the amount by which the charges actually collected exceeded the charges which would have been collected had the rates fixed by the Legislature been observed. It refused, however, to make refunds on shipments made over the interstate route, on the ground that the state statute did not affect them.\n Among such shipments were those involved in these cases, from Duluth by the interstate route to three Minnesota points, Hitterdal, Battle Lake, and Hawley, cities on the Northern Pacific lying west of Carlton. The shipment in each case was delivered to the Railway without any instruction as to how it should be routed; but the plaintiffs contended that, in the absence of instructions, it was the duty of the carrier to select that \n\n[247 U.S. 477, 480]\n\u00a0\n route which was for the interest of the shipper, namely the intrastate route, because it would prove to be the cheaper, if the rates prescribed by the state were upheld. The several shippers claimed that they were entitled to the same refunds which would have been made if the coal had been carried on the intrastate route; and the suits were brought to recover these amounts.\n The railway answered, in the first two cases, that, at the time of the shipments, the rates published were (because of the injunction in effect) identical on the two routes; that 'in the ordinary and proper and economical operation of its property, it was necessary to move, and this defendant in general did and does now, move all out-bound shipments from Duluth via the interstate line and all in-bound shipments into Duluth via the intrastate line, and that to have carried the shipments referred to in the complaint to their destination ... via said intrastate line instead of via the interstate line, over which they were actually carried, would have entailed great additional expense upon this defendant,' and that these rates were just and reasonable for the service performed and were collected pursuant to the tariffs published and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. In the third case the answer alleged, in addition, that on December 24, 1915, and prior to the commencement of that action, the Interstate ommerce Commission had, in Holmes & Hallowell Company v. Great Northern Railway Company, 37 Interst. Com. Com'n, 627, decided that the practice of defendant in routing its westbound shipments from Duluth over its interstate line was a proper and reasonable practice and had denied the application for reparation on shipments of coal made over that route.\n The judgments entered were upon demurrers to the answers. That in No. 205 was entered May 28, 1916; that in No. 206 on May 23, 1916; that in No. 526 on May 2, 1917. 133 Minn. 93, 157 N. W. 996; 133 Minn. 461, 157 N. W. 998; 136 Minn. 468, 162 N. W. 1087. \n\n[247 U.S. 477, 481]\n\u00a0\n In each case it is assigned as error that the state court held that the cause of action therein is not affected by the federal statute regulating interstate commerce, and also that the state court assumed jurisdiction in advance of a determination by the Interstate Commerce Commission as to whether the practice of the Northern Pacific Railway, in sending via its interstate route all shipments of the character involved in these cases, was reasonable. In the third case the additional error is assigned that the court held that the intrastate rate should be applied, although the Interstate Commerce Commission had found that the practice of routing out- bound shipments from Duluth via the interstate route was proper and reasonable. The objection that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding was not made in the answers in the trial court; but it was insisted upon before the Supreme Court of Minnesota, was considered and overruled by that court (133 Minn. 93, 97, 157 N. W. 996), and is available here. In numbers 205 and 206 judgment was entered before the Act of September 6, 1916. A federal question is involved; and the cases are properly here under section 237 of the Judicial Code. In No. 526 the judgment was entered after the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448 (39 Stat. 726), took effect. In that case there was not drawn in question the validity of a statute or treaty nor the validity of any authority exercised under the state. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co. v. Gilbert, \n245 U.S. 162\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 58, 62 L. Ed. --; Ireland v. Woods, \n246 U.S. 323\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 319, 62 L. Ed. --; Stadelman v. Miner, \n246 U.S. 544\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 359, 62 L. Ed. --. The writ of error in No. 526 must therefore be dismissed, although the defendant in error has not objected to the jurisdiction of this court.\n We proceed to consider Nos. 205 and 206. In those cases the Supreme Court of Minnesota declared that the carrier's duty was governed by the common law and it stated the applicable principle as follows (133 Minn. 96, 157 N. W. 997):- \n\n[247 U.S. 477, 482]\n\u00a0\n 'Where a railroad company operates two lines of railroad between the same points, and the freight rate over one line is less than such rate over the other line, if other conditions are reasonably equal, it is the duty of the company to transport shipments between those points over the line which will give the shipper the benefit of the cheaper rate. To justify transporting such shipments over the other line, and thereby compel the shipper to pay the higher rate, the company must show that such line was chosen by the shipper, or that the circumstances or exigencies were such that a proper regard for the interests of the shipper precluded the use of the cheaper line.'\n In the absence of shipping instructions it is ordinarily the duty of the carrier to ship by the cheaper route. But the duty is not an absolute one. The obligation of the carrier is to deal justly with the shipper, not to consider only his interests and to disregard wholly its own and those of the general public. If, all things considered, it would be unreasonable to ship by the cheaper route, the carrier is not compelled to do so. The duty is upon the carrier to select the cheaper route only 'if other conditions are reasonably equal.' Resort to the more expensive route may be justified. And the justification may rest either upon the peculiar circumstances of a particular case or upon a general practice. In the c ses before us the justification is rested upon a general practice. The answers allege that, because of the grades of the two lines, all outbound shipments were and are in general moved over the southerly route on account of the very great expense which another arrangement would entail. It may well be, under such circumstances, that carriage over the interstate route would be justified, even if it appeared that it was feasible to haul freight out of Duluth over the intrastate line. Whether the practice of the carrier of shipping over the interstate route was reasonable, when a lower \n\n[247 U.S. 477, 483]\n\u00a0\n intrastate route was open to it, presents an administrative question, one of perhaps considerable complexity.\n The railway contends that, since the administrative question upon which its liability depends involves the reasonableness of a practice in interstate commerce and the traffic actually moved in interstate commerce, the court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy until that administrative question had been determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The shipper, on the other hand, urges that the rule which requires such preliminary determination of administrative questions by the Commission applies only to those cases where the question involved is whether a particular rate is unreasonable or whether a particular practice is discriminatory. But the rule is not so limited. It applies, likewise, to any practice of the carrier which gives rise to the application of a rate. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. American Tie & Timber Co., Ltd., \n234 \nU.S. 138, 147\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 885; Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Puritan Coal Co., \n237 \nU.S. 121, 131\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 484; Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Clark Brothers Coal Mining Co., \n238 \nU.S. 456, 469\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 896. The Interstate Commerce Commission has frequently entertained proceedings for refunds for misrouting under such circumstances. \n1\n Indeed, long before these suits were filed, proceedings had been begun before the Interstate Commerce Commission against this and other railroad companies to secure the refunds of amounts paid for shipment over the interstate routes between Minnesota points in excess of that which would have been payable, if shipment had been made over the intrastate routes.

And before the judgments were entered by the Supreme Court of Minnesota in these cases the Interstate Commerce Commission had determined that, under the circumstances, 'the carrier was not required by law to change its methods of operation and abandon the use of its more favorable interstate line,' and had refused to grant refunds in respect to the shipment of other commodities, under circumstances precisely like those presented here.\n The fact that the administrative question presented involves an intrastate as well as interstate route does not prevent the application of the rule, that the courts may not be resorted to until the administrative question has been determined by the Commission. It is sufficient that one of the routes is interstate. Compare the Minnesota Rates Cases, \n230 U.S. 352\n, 419-420, 33 Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; Houston, E. & W.

WISMER(1918)\nNo. 152\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles Donnelly, of St. Paul, Minn., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful and Mr. John W. Davis, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit is one in ejectment by the Northern Pacific Railway Company to recover possession of 80 acres of land (the title to 64,000 acres depends upon the decision), and it is here on writ of error to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming that of the District Court in favor of the defendant. \n\n[246 U.S. 283, 284]\n\u00a0\n The principles of law applicable to the case are few and well settled and the decision of it depends upon the interpretation to be given to stipulated facts.\n The plaintiff in error is the successor in interest to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, and the defendant in error, substituted for the deceased defendant, George F. Wismer, claims to own the land in controversy by virtue of a homestead entry made in 1910, upon which a patent was issued in 1913\n\n\n By act of Congress dated July 2, 1864 (13 Stat. 365, c. 217) there was granted to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of its line to the Pacific Coast, 20 alternate odd-numbered sections of land per mile on each side of the railroad line, which it should locate and adopt, within the boundaries of any territory and 10 alternate odd-numbered sections per mile on each side of the railroad line, which it should adopt, within the boundaries of any state. The grant embraces only lands to which 'the United States have full title, not reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, and free from pre- emption, or other claims or rights, at the time the line of said road is definitely fixed.'\n On October 4, 1880, the Railroad Company definitely located the position of its line opposite the land in controversy and filed a plat thereof, as required by law, and it is claimed that upon the filing of this plat the company became entitled to the lands granted, including those of the defendant in error, as of July 2, 1864, the date of the granting act of Congress.\n The claim of the defendant in error, which prevailed in each of the lower courts, is that the land in controversy was reserved or otherwise appropriated, within the meaning of the terms of the grant to the railroad company of 1864, quoted above, at the time this part of the line of the railroad was definitely located, for the reason that it was then within an Indian reservation, or was subject to an \n\n[246 U.S. 283, 285]\n\u00a0\n Indian claim, which prevented the grant attaching to it, by virtue of the following facts, which we condense from the stipulation between the parties.\n Prior to August 16, 1877, bands of Indians of the Spokane and other tribes occupied, for hunting and fishing, the extensive territory now comprising the eastern part of the state of Washington, in which they had not then ceded to the United States any part of their rights. In the spring of that year certain of these Indian tribes commenced hostilities against the white settlers which resulted in war with the United States, in which they were urging the Spokane tribe, then at peace, to join.\n On May 7, 1877, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs directed Col. E. C. Watkins, an Indian inspector, in charge of all agencies in Washington Territory, to give his 'special attention' to the subject of gathering the roving Indians 'upon permanent reservations,' with the result that on August 16, 17, 18, 1877, a council was held at Spokane Falls, Washington, between the chiefs and headmen of the Spokane tribe of Indians and Col. Watkins, acting 'in his official capacity as Indian inspector, representing the Department of the Interior,' and Gen. Frank Wheaton and Capt. M. C. Wilkinson, of the United States Army, representing the Department of War.\n It is expressly stipulated 'that for the purpose of collecting the said Indians belonging to the said tribe (the Spokane tribe) on a reservation,' and of inducing them to establish homes and to engage in agricultural pursuits, to extinguish their title 'to all other lands not within the said reservation' and to remain at peace with the United States, the agreement following was signed by the representatives of the government of the United States and the chiefs and headmen of the tribe who attended the council, viz.:\n'In Council at Spokane Falls, W. T. \n\n[246 U.S. 283, 286]\n\u00a0\n 'We, the undersigned chiefs and headmen of the Spokane tribe of Indians for ourselves and our people hereby agree to accept the following described land for our reservation: Beginning at the source of the Chimokan creek in Washington Territory, thence down said creek to the Spokane river, thence down said river to the Columbia river, thence up the Columbia river to the mouth of Nimchin creek, thence easterly to the place of beginning.\n\n'And we do further agree to go upon the same by the first of November next with a view of establishing our permanent homes thereon and engaging in agricultural pursuits. We hereby renew our friendly relations with the whites and promise to remain at peace with the government and abide by all laws of the same, and obey the orders of the Indian Bureau and the officers acting thereunder.'\n\n On August 23 Col. Watkins reported the result f the Council to his superior officer, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and sent him a copy of the executed agreement, with his recommendation that the territory described therein should be set apart and reserved for the Spokane tribe.\n Immediately after the signing of this agreement and prior to November 14th of the same year, Col. Watkins, still 'acting in his official capacity, located such of the Spokane Indians as were not already residing thereon, upon said reservation' described in the agreement, and on November 26, 1877, he reported this action to his superior, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who communicated it to the Secretary of the Interior, with his approval, on December 29, 1877, who, in turn, communicated it to the United States Senate on January 23, 1878.\n The Indians remained at peace with the United States and continued in the use and occupancy of the lands described in the agreement and claimed the same 'as their reservation' until the year 1910. \n\n[246 U.S. 283, 287]\n\u00a0\n The encroachment of squatters upon the land thus reserved, resulted in an order by Brig. Gen. Howard on September 3, 1880, directing that the military force under his command should protect the territory described in the agreement of August, 1877, against settlement by others than the Spokane Indians until survey of the land should be made or until further instructions.\n On January, 18, 1881, President Hayes, by executive order, formally set aside and reserved the territory described in the agreement of August, 1877, for the use and occupancy of the Spokane Indians.\n The Indians occupied the reservation until after the Act of May 29, 1908, was passed (35 Stat. 458, c. 217) directing that the Secretary of the Interior should cause allotments to be made, under the allotment laws, to all Indians having tribal rights and belonging to the Spokane Indian reservation who had not theretofore received allotments, and providing that the surplus agricultural lands should be opened for settlement and entry under the homestead laws, and that the net proceeds derived from the sale of such lands should be deposited in the United States Treasury to the credit of the Indians of the Spokane reservation. It was under the provisions of this act that the decedent of the defendant in error obtained his patent.\n This summary of the stipulated facts points to the inevitable decision of the case.\n The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, was charged with the management of all Indian affairs and matters arising out of Indian relations (R. S.  441, 463, 2058, 2149 [Comp. St. 1916,  681, 716, 4000, 4152]), and clearly he commissioned Col. Watkins in advance to treat with the Spokane tribe for the setting apart to them of a permanent reservation through an agreement such as that of August, 1877. The plaintiff in error concedes, as it must, that if the Secretary of the Interior approved the action taken by Col. Watkins prior to the filing \n\n[246 U.S. 283, 288]\n\u00a0\n of the plat of its line on October 4, 1880, the reservation must be considered as lawfully established and the lands thereby removed beyond the scope of the grant to the railroad company. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 512; Wolsey v. Chapman, \n101 U.S. 755\n, 769; Wood v. Beach, \n156 U.S. 548\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 410; United States v. Mid West Oil Co., \n236 U.S. 459\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 309; C., M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n244 \nU.S. 351, 357\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 625. And reservations made by heads of bureaus, such as the Commissioner of the General Land Office, or the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in the administration of the matters committed to their charge stand upon the same footing, where the Secretary of the Interior is informed of their action and where, as in this case, he either expressly or tacitly approves the same. Spencer v. McDougal \n159 U.S. 62\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 1026.\n Such being the law, we cannot doubt that the sound infe ence from the stipulated facts as we have stated them is that, with full understanding of the situation the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs approved the action of Col. Watkins not later, certainly, than the sending of his report to the Senate on January 23, 1878, which was almost three years prior to the filing of the railway company's plat, and that the executive order of the President on January 18, 1881, simply continued and gave formal sanction to what had been done before.\n That the reservation was in fact made and the lands exclusively devoted to the use of the Indians from the date of the agreement of August, 1877, is beyond controversy; that no objection was ever made by his superiors to the action taken by Col. Watkins is equally clear, and to hold that for want of a formal approval by the Secretary of the Interior, all of the conduct of the government and of the Indians in making and ratifying and in good faith carrying out the agreement between them, even to the extent of protecting the reservation by mil- \n\n[246 U.S. 283, 289]\n\u00a0\n itary forces from intrusion, is without effect, would be to subordinate the realities of the situation to mere form, for the delay in the issuing of the formal executive order of the President under the circumstances can be attributed only to the exigencies of the public business; by his representative, the Secretary of the Interior, he had approved the setting apart of the lands to the use of the Indians almost three years before.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals will be affirmed, for the reason that the Spokane Indian reservation was lawfully created prior to the filing of the plat of the line of the plaintiff company on October 4, 1880. Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","115":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHWESTERN MUT. LIFE INS. CO. v. STATE OF WISCONSIN(1918)\nNo. 240\nArgued: March 22, 1918Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Harry L. Butler, of Madison, Wis., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Walter Drew, of Milwaukee, Wis., for the State of Wisconsin. \n\n[247 U.S. 132, 133]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought to recover certain taxes or license fees paid by the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company to the state of Wisconsin; the same were paid under protest, and this action was to recover $482,193.23 paid in 1912, and $505,643.22 in 1913. The case was decided in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, upon demurrer to the original and amended complaints, and judgment was rendered in favor of the state. 163 Wis. 484, 155 N. W. 609, 158 N. W. 328.\n The taxes in question were collected under the statutes of Wisconsin. Section 1220, Wis. Stats. of 1911, being section 51.32 of the later Stats.; section 1221, now section 51.33, being the so-called retaliatory law; section 1222, subsec. 5 of section 1947; and section 1948\n\n\n The substance of the statute immediately involved is thus stated by the plaintiff in error:\n\n\n[247 U.S. 132, 134]\n\u00a0\n 'Every company ... transacting the business of life insurance within this state (excepting only such fraternal societies as have lodge organizations and insure only the lives of their own members) shall annually, on or before March 1, pay 'in lieu of all taxes for any purpose authorized by the laws of this state (except taxes on real estate), certain prescribed license fees for transacting such business.\"\n It appears that fraternal societies with lodge organizations insuring only the lives of their own members are not subject to this tax, and foreign level premium companies, similar to the plaintiff in error, are subject to an annual tax of but $300.00 liable to increase under the so- called retaliatory law according as other states impose like taxes on similar companies of Wisconsin. Assessment and stipulated premium companies, domestic and foreign, are taxed $300.00, or as to foreign companies such larger amounts as may be proposed under the retaliatory law. The license when granted authorizes the company to transact business until the first of March of the ensuing year unless sooner revoked or forfeited.\n The contentions of a federal nature, raised by the plaintiff in error, are that this license tax imposes an unlawful burden upon interstate commerce in contravention of section 8, article 1 of the federal Constitution; that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment in denying the equal protection of the laws to the Northwestern Company by arbitrarily discriminating against it and in favor of foreign insurance companies, and between it and fraternal associations, both domestic and foreign; that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment in imposing an arbitrary, discriminatory, and confiscatory burden upon the Northwestern Company.\n As to the annual license fee, it is made up as follows:\n'Domestic Companies. (1) If such company, corporation or association is organized under th laws of this \n\n[247 U.S. 132, 135]\n\u00a0\n state, and is not purely an assessment or stipulated premium plan company under chapter 270, Laws of 1899 (section 1955-1), 3 per centum of its gross income from all sources for the year ending December thirty-first, next prior to said first day of March, excepting therefrom income from rents of real estate, upon which said company, corporation or association has paid the taxes assessed thereon, and excepting also premiums collected outside of the state of Wisconsin on policies held by nonresidents of the state of Wisconsin. In ascertaining the income upon which such license fee shall be computed as aforesaid, no deduction shall be made from premiums, whether paid in cash or premium notes, on account of dividends allowed or paid to the insured.'\n\n The statute also provides that such license fee shall be in lieu of all taxes for any purpose authorized by the laws of the state except taxes on real estate. The Northwestern Company was thus obliged to pay 3 per cent. of its gross income less income from rents of real estate, and less premium receipts from outside of the state.\n Before entering upon a consideration of the errors assigned the nature and effect of this system of taxation must be borne in mind. The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company is a corporation of the state of Wisconsin, having large reserves in that state, having a taxable situs therein. Of this statute the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said:\n'It covers all the contributions which the state demands from the company or its business except real estate taxes, which are relatively small in amount. It is common knowledge that all of the great level premium insurance companies of the present day have vast reserve funds, to protect their liabilities on policies, running up into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and that these reserves are invested in interest-bearing securities, of* \n\n[247 U.S. 132, 136]\n\u00a0\n which real estate loans secured by mortgage generally form the largest part. In the complaint in the present case it appears that on December 31, 1911, the plaintiff had outstanding loans secured by real estate mortgages amounting to $153,562,-654.39, of which only $5, 654,369.10 covered real estate in Wisconsin. It also appears that the plaintiff's income from real estate mortgages for the year ending on said last-named date amounted to $7,446,393.10 and its income from bonds to $3,172,489.58. These securities are all credits, i. e., personal property of an intangible character, the situs of which for the purposes of taxation is in this state at the residence of the corporation.'\n\n And in the opinion on the filing of the amended complaint, added:\n'In this connection it is argued that if a personal property tax had been levied on the plaintiff's reserve, consisting of securities and credits, there would have been deducted from the amount thereof, under the existing policy of the state with regard to the taxation of such property, its liabilities to policy holders, i. e., the present value of its outstanding policies valued as required by law, which is about 90 per cent., of the reserve. It is also argued that if the plaintiff had been subjected to income taxation under the state law it would have paid much less than under the 3 per cent. license fee requirement.\n\n'We do not regard either contention as well founded. Our statutes governing the taxation of securities and credits for many years provided that there should be exempted from taxation so much thereof as 'shall equal the amount of bona fide and unconditional debts by him owing.' This provision was repealed by the Income Tax Law, which marked the abandonment of the attempt to levy personal property taxes upon that species of property. Chapter 658, Laws 1911.\n\n'It seems entirely clear that the liability to policy \n\n[247 U.S. 132, 137]\n\u00a0\n holders which the plaintiff refers to is not in any sense an 'unconditional debt,' and as the policy of the state has never extended the exemption to any liability short of an unconditional debt we are unable to see any sound basis for th argument made.\n\n'As to the contention that if the plaintiff were taxed under the income tax system its tax burden would be far less than under the present license system, we shall not attempt to go into the arguments and figures presented in detail. It is sufficient to say that we do not think it appears from the allegations of the amended complaint that the plaintiff now pays substantially greater sums than it would pay under either the income taxation system or the former personal property taxation system.\n\n'At all events there does not affirmatively appear to be any such disparity as would condemn the law as arbitrarily discriminatory.'\n\n While these views of the nature and effect of the law are not conclusive upon us, they are accepted unless they appear to be illfounded, and we find no reason to reject them. The tax in question is, therefore, not only one for the privilege of doing life insurance business within the state, but is in effect a commutation tax, levied by the state in place of all other taxation upon the personal property of the company in the state of Wisconsin.\n It is insisted that because of the foreign investment business of the company, large in amount, and involving shipments of securities, correspondence, etc., beyond the state, this law burdens interstate commerce. We need not reiterate the reasoning upon which this court has repeatedly held that a state may not by its system of taxation impose burdens upon interstate commerce, the cases have been recently reviewed and the doctrine reaffirmed. Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 U.S. 178\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 85, 62 L. Ed. --; International Paper Company v. Massachusetts, \n246 U.S. 135\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 292, 62 L. Ed. --; Cheney Bros. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 U.S. 147\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 295, 62 L. Ed. --. \n\n[247 U.S. 132, 138]\n\u00a0\n The construction of the act by the state court brings the case within the decisions of this court in U. S. Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 U.S. 335\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 211; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 U.S. 450\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 373, 62 L. Ed. --, decided April 15, 1918. In the former case a commutation tax upon gross receipts of the express company from state and interstate business was sustained as casting no burden upon interstate commerce. In the Cudahy Packing Company Case a tax of like character was held not a burden upon interstate commerce, although much of the gross receipts, which measured the property tax, was derived from such commerce. In both of these cases, following the previous decisions of this court, the tax was held to be within the authority of the state, and the inclusion in the measure of taxation of the receipts partly derived from interstate commerce was held not to invalidate the tax, its amount not being in excess of what would be legitimate as an ordinary tax on the property taken at its value.\n We have said thus much as to the alleged invalidity of this license tax as a burden upon interstate commerce, without deciding, as we do not find it necessary to decide, whether the so-called foreign investment business of the company does or does not of itself amount to interstate commerce. If it amounts to commerce of that character no burden is cast upon it by such tax as is here involved, since the gross receipts coming from that character of business are used only as a measure of the value of the property and franchise lawfully taxable in the state.\n That the tax upon the life insurance business, which is the subject- matter of the license tax here involved, is not a tax upon interstate commerce is established by a reference to the recent full consideration of the subject by this court. N. Y. Life Insurance Co. v. Deer Lodge Co., \n231 U.S. 495\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 167.\n This brings us to the question whether the statute denies to the company the equal protection of the laws. That \n\n[247 U.S. 132, 139]\n\u00a0\n the state is not because of the Forteenth Amendment required to tax all property alike, and may classify the subjects selected for taxation, is too well established to require citation of the many ases in this court which have so held. The classification may not be arbitrary and must rest upon real differences-subject to these qualifications the state has a wide discretion. In this connection the Northwestern Company contends that the tax upon it is so different from that imposed upon foreign level premium companies doing a like business within the state, that an arbitrary discrimination, amounting to a denial of equal protection, is exercised as against it and in favor of the foreign company. As we have already said, the foreign companies of like character pay a privilege or occupation tax in the sum of $300.00 per annum. The state court held, and we think properly so, that foreign insurance companies occupy a relation to the state which is different from that of a domestic company. The latter has within the borders and taxing jurisdiction of the state a large amount of personal property, receiving protection, and subject to taxation. The foreign company has its reserves in the state of its domicile, and there subject to local taxation, which is of itself a substantial difference. Moreover, we have held that it is no denial of equal protection for a state to impose a different rate upon one of its own corporations than that imposed upon a foreign corporation, for the privilege of doing business within its borders. Kansas City, Memphis & Birmingham R. R. Co. v. Stiles, \n242 \nU.S. 111, 118\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 58. In the case of Cheney Brothers Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, this court said:\n'... A state does not surrender or abridge its power to change and revise its taxing system and tax rates by merely licensing or permitting a foreign corporation to engage in local business and acquire property within its limits, and, second, that 'a state may impose a* \n\n[247 U.S. 132, 140]\n\u00a0\n different rate of taxation upon a foreign corporation for the privilege of doing business within the state than it applies to its own corporations upon the franchises which the state grants in creating them.' Kansas City, Memphis & Birmingham R. R. Co. v. Stiles, \n242 U.S. 111\n, 118 [37 Sup. Ct. 58].'\n\n But, it is said that these decisions are opposed to the decision of this court in Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, \n216 U.S. 400\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247. In that case the railway corporation of another state came into the state of Alabama in compliance with its laws, paid the license and property tax imposed upon other corporations doing business within the state, under sanction of the laws of the state acquired a large amount of railroad property therein, when it was attempted to subject it to a further tax for the privilege of doing business as a foreign corporation, which tax was not imposed upon domestic corporations doing the same kind of business in the same manner, and it was held that such classification was arbitrary and void under the Fourteenth Amendment. In that case we laid stress upon the fact that the tax related to railroad property not susceptible of other uses, which placed in the state had to remain there permanently, and could not be withdrawn at the pleasure of its owners. Under such circumstances, and dealing with that character of property, we held that the particular tax constituted such discrimination as to deny to the company the equal protection of the laws. That case was distinguished in the decision in Kansas City, Memphis & Birmingham R. R. Co. v. Stiles, supra, and also in disposing of the case of the White Company involved in Cheney Brothers Company et al. v. Massachusetts, supra. The difference between the Southern Railway Company Case and the one under consideration is quite obvious.\n As to the alleged discrimination between old line level premium companies and beneficial associations, which are exempted from taxation under this statute, we think the differences are plain. The fraternal and beneficial- \n\n[247 U.S. 132, 141]\n\u00a0\n features are wanting in organizations like that of the Northwestern Company. The ascertainment and collection of premiums and paym nts for insurance are upon wholly different plans. As to the alleged discrimination in favor of stipulated premium compaines and assessment companies, the plaintiff in error in its brief says that no domestic company of these classes and but one foreign company existed in Wisconsin in 1912, and that as to this its argument as to discrimination in favor of foreign level premium companies applies. What we have already said disposes of that contention. We find no reason to disagree with the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in the conclusion that differences upon which classification rests in this statute are not fanciful, but real and substantial, and that the dissimilarities in treatment fall short of that arbitrary classification which amounts to a denial of the equal protection of the laws.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOETJEN v.

Blair, of New York City, for defendant is error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases involving the same question, were argued and will be decided together. They are suits in replevin and involve the title to two large consignments of hides, which the plaintiff in error claims to own as assignee of Martinez & Co., a partnership engaged in business in the city of Torreon, Mexico, but which the defendant in error claims to own by purchase from the Finnegan-Brown Company, a Texas corporation which it is alleged purchased the hides in Mexico from General Francisco Villa on January 3, 1914\n\n\n The cases were commenced in a circuit court of New Jersey in which judgments were rendered for the defendants, which were affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals (87 N. J. Law, 552, 94 Atl. 789, L. R. A. 1917A, 276; 87 N. J. Law, 704, 96 Atl. 1102), and they are brought to this court on the theory that the claim of title to the hides by the defendant in error is invalid because based upon a purchase from General Villa, who, it is urged, confiscated them contrary to the provisions of the Hague onvention of 1907 respecting the laws and customs of war on land; that the judgment of the state court denied to the plaintiff in error this right which he 'set up and claimed' under the Hague Convention or treaty; and that this denial gives him the right of review in this court.\n A somewhat detailed description will be necessary of the political conditions in Mexico prior to and at the time of the seizure of the property in controversy by the military authorities. It appears in the record, and is a matter of general history, that on February 23, 1913, Madero, President of the Republic of Mexico, was assassinated; that immediately thereafter General Huerta declared himself Provisional President of the Republic \n\n[246 U.S. 297, 300]\n\u00a0\n and took the oath of office as such; that on the 26th day of March following General Carranza, who was then governor of the state of Coahuila, inaugurated a revolution against the claimed authority of Huerta and in a 'Manifesto Addressed to the Mexican Nation' proclaimed the organization of a constitutional government under 'the plan of Guadalupe,' and that civil war was at once entered upon between the followers and forces of the two leaders. When General Carranza assumed the leadership of what were called the Constitutionalist forces he commissioned General Villa his representative, as 'Commander of the North,' and assigned him to an independent command in that part of the country. Such progress was made by the Carranza forces that in the autumn of 1913 they were in military possession, as the record shows, of approximately two-thirds of the area of the entire country, with the exception of a few scattered towns and cities, and after a battle lasting several days the city of Torreon in the state of Coahuila was captured by General Villa on October 1 of that year. Immediately after the capture of Torreon, Villa proposed levying a military contribution on the inhabitants, for the support of his army, and thereupon influential citizens, preferring to provide the required money by an assessment upon the community, to having their property forcibly seized, called together a largely attended meeting and after negotiations with General Villa as to the amount to be paid, an assessment was made on the men of property of the city, which was in large part promptly paid. Martinez, the owner from whom the plaintiff in error claims title to the property involved in this case, was a wealthy resident of Torreon and was a dealer in hides in a large way. Being an adherent of Huerta, when Torreon was captured Martinez fled the city and failed to pay the assessment imposed upon him, and it was to satisfy this assessment that, by order of General Villa, the hides in controversy \n\n[246 U.S. 297, 301]\n\u00a0\n were seized and on January 3, 1914, were sold in Mexico to the Finnegan- Brown Company. They were paid for in Mexico, and were thereafter shipped into the United States and were replevied, as stated.\n This court will take judicial notice of the fact that since the transactions thus detailed and since the trial of this case in the lower courts, the government of the United States recognized the government of Carranza as the de facto government of the Republic of Mexico, on October 19, 1915, and as the de jure government on August 31, 1917. Jones v. United States, \n137 U.S. 202\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 80; Underhill v. Hernandez, 168, U. S. 250, 18 Sup. Ct. 83.\n On this state of fact the plaintiff in error argues that the 'Regulations' annexed to the Hague Convention of 1907 'Respecting Laws and Customs of War on Land' constitute a treaty between the United States and Mexico; that these 'Regulations' forbid such seizure and sale of property as we are considering in this case; and that, therefore, somewhat vaguely, no title passed by the sale made by General Villa and the property may be recovered by the Mexican owner or his assignees when found in this country.\n It would, perhaps, be sufficient answer to this contention to say that the Hague Conventions are international in character, des gned and adapted to regulate international warfare, and that they do not, in terms or in purpose, apply to a civil war. Were it otherwise, however, it might be effectively argued that the declaration relied upon that 'private property cannot be confiscated' contained in article 46 of the Regulations does not have the scope claimed for it, since article 49 provides that 'money contributions ... for the needs of the army' may be levied upon on occupied territory, and article 52 provides that 'requisitions in kind and services may be demanded for the needs of the army of occupation,' and that contributions in kind shall, as far as possible, be \n\n[246 U.S. 297, 302]\n\u00a0\n paid for in cash, and when not so paid for a receipt shall be given and payment of the amount due shall be made as soon as possible. And also for the reason that the 'Convention' to which the 'Regulations' are annexed, recognizing the incomplete character of the results arrived at, expressly provides that until a more complete code is agreed upon, cases not provided for in the 'Regulations' shall be governed by the principles of the law of nations.\n But, since claims similar to the one before us are being made in many cases in this and in other courts, we prefer to place our decision upon the application of three clearly settled principles of law to the facts of this case as we have stated them.\n The conduct of the foreign relations of our government is committed by the Constitution to the executive and legislative-'the political'- departments of the government, and the propriety of what may be done in the exercise of this political power is not subject to judicial inquiry or decision. United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610; Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 307, 309; Garcia v. Lee, 12 Pet. 511, 517, 520; Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415, 420; In re Cooper, \n143 \nU.S. 472, 499\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 453. It has been specifically decided that:\n'Who is the sovereign, de jure or de facto, of a territory is not a judicial, but is a political question, the determination of which by the legislative and executive departments of any government conclusively binds the judges, as well as all other officers, citizens and subjects of that government. This principle has always been upheld by this court, and has been affirmed under a great variety of circumstances.' Jones v. United States, \n137 \nU.S. 202, 212\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 80, 83 (34 L. Ed. 691).\n\n It is also the result of the interpretation by this court of the principles of international law that when a government which originates in revolution or revolt is recognized by the political department of our government as the de \n\n[246 U.S. 297, 303]\n\u00a0\n jure government of the country in which it is established, such recognition is retroactive in effect and validates all the actions and conduct of the government so recognized from the commencement of its existence. Williams v. Bruffy, \n96 U.S. 176\n, 186; Underhill v. Hernandez, \n168 \nU.S. 250, 253\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 83. See s. c., 65 Fed. 577, 13 C. C. A. 51, 38 L. R. A. 405.\n To these principles we must add that:\n'Every sovereign state is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign state, and the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own territory. Redress of grievances by reason of such acts must be obtained through the means open to be available of by sovereign powers as between themselves.' Underhill v. Hernandez, \n168 \nU.S. 250, 252\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 83, 84 (42 L. Ed. 456); American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 U.S. 347\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047.\n\n Applying these principles of law to the case at bar, we have a duly commissioned military commander of what must be accepted as the legitimate government of Mexico, in the progress of a revolution, and when conducting active independent operations, seizing and selling in Mexico, as a military contribu ion, the property in controversy, at the time owned and in the possession of a citizen of Mexico, the assignor of the plaintiff in error. Plainly this was the action, in Mexico, of the legitimate Mexican government when dealing with a Mexican citizen, and, as we have seen, for the soundest reasons, and upon repeated decisions of this court such action is not subject to re-examination and modification by the courts of this country.\n The principle that the conduct of one independent government cannot be successfully questioned in the courts of another is as applicable to a case involving the title to property brought within the custody of a court, such as we have here, as it was held to be to the cases cited, in which claims for damages were based upon acts done in a foreign country, for it rests at last upon the highest \n\n[246 U.S. 297, 304]\n\u00a0\n considerations of international comity and expediency. To permit the validity of the acts of one sovereign state to be reexamined and perhaps condemned by the courts of another would very certainly 'imperil the amicable relations between governments and vex the peace of nations.'\n It is not necessary to consider, as the New Jersey court did, the validity of the levy of the contribution made by the Mexican commanding general, under rules of international law applicable to the situation, since the subject is not open to re-examination by this or any other American court.\n The remedy of the former owner, or of the purchaser from him, of the property in controversy, if either has any remedy, must be found in the courts of Mexico or through the diplomatic agencies of the political department of our government. The judgments of the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOMAECHEVARRIA v. STATE OF IDAHO(1918)\nNo. 102\nArgued: December 20, 1917Decided: March 18, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 343, 344]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank P. Prichard, of Philadelphia, Pa., and S. L. Hodgin, of Twin Falls, Idaho, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. T. A. Walters and William Healy, both of Boise, Idaho, for State of Idaho.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n For more than forty years the raising of cattle and sheep have been important industries in Idaho. The stock feeds in part by grazing on the public domain of the United States. This is done with the gove nment's acquiescence, without the payment of compensation, and without federal regulation. Buford v. Houtz, \n133 \nU.S. 320, 326\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 305. Experience has demonstrated, says the state court, that in arid and semi-arid regions cattle will not graze, nor can they thrive, on ranges where sheep are allowed to graze extensively; that the encroachment of sheep upon ranges previously occupied by cattle results in driving out the cattle and destroying or greatly impairing the industry; and that this conflict of interests led to frequent and serious breaches of the peace and the loss of many lives. \n1\n Efficient policing of the ranges is \n\n[246 U.S. 343, 345]\n\u00a0\n impossible; for the state is sparsely settled and the public domain is extensive, comprising still more than one-fourth of the land surface. \n2\n To avert clashes between sheep herdsmen and the farmers who customarily allowed their few cattle to graze on the public domain near their dwellings, the territorial Legislature passed in 1875 the so-called 'Two Mile Limit Law.' It was enacted first as a local statute applicable to three counties, but was extended in 1879 and again in 1883 to additional counties, and was made a general law in 1887.3 After the admission of Idaho to the Union, the statute was re-enacted and its validity sustained by this court in Bacon v. Walker, \n204 U.S. 311\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 289. To avert clashes between the sheep herdsmen and the cattle rangers, further legislation was found necessary; and in 1883 the law (now section 6872 of the Revised Codes) was enacted which prohibits any person having charge of sheep from allowing them to graze on a range previously occupied by cattle. \n4\n For \n\n[246 U.S. 343, 346]\n\u00a0\n violating this statute the plaintiff in error, a sheep herdsman, was convicted in the local police court and sentenced to pay a fine. The judgment was affirmed by an intermediate appellate court and also by the Supreme Court of Idaho. 27 Idaho, 797, 152 Pac. 280. On writ of error to this court the validity of the statute is assailed on the ground that the statute is inconsistent both with the Fourteenth Amendment and with the act of Congress of February 25, 1885, c. 149, 23 Stat. 321 (Comp. St. 1916 ,  4997-5002), entitled 'An act to prevent unlawful occupancy of the public lands.'\n First. It is urged that the statute denies rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, namely: Privileges of citizens of the United States, in so far as it prohibits the use of the public lands by sheep owners; and equal protection of the laws, in that it gives to cattle owners a preference over sheep owners. These contentions are, in substance, the same as those made in respect to the 'Two Mile Limit Law' in Bacon v. Walker, supra; and the answer made there is applicable here. The police power of the state extends over the federal public domain, at least when there is no legislation by Congress on the subject. \n5\n We cannot say that the measure adopted \n\n[246 U.S. 343, 347]\n\u00a0\n by the state is unreasonable or arbitrary. It was found that conflicts between cattle rangers and sheep herders on the public domain could be reconciled only by segregation. In national forests, where the use of land is regulated by the federal government, the plan of segregation is widely adopted. \n6\n And it is not an arbitrary discrimination to give preference to cattle owners in prior occupancy without providing for a like preference to sheep owners in prior occupancy. \n7\n For experience shows that sheep do not require protection against encroachment by cattle, and that cattle rangers are not likely to encroach upon ranges previously occupied by sheep herders. The propriety of treating sheep differ- \n\n[246 U.S. 343, 348]\n\u00a0\n ently than cattle has been generally recognized. \n8\n That the interest of the sheep owners of Idaho received due consideration is indicated by the fact that in 1902 they opposed the abolition by the government of the free ranges. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Second. It is also urged that the Idaho statute, being a criminal one is so indefinite in its terms as to violate the guaranty by the Fourteenth Amendment of due process of law, since it fails to provide for the ascertainment of the boundaries of a 'range' or for determining what length of time is necessary to constitute a prior occupation a 'usual' one within the meaning of the act. Men familiar with range conditions and desirous of observing the law will have little difficulty in determining what is prohibited by it. Similar expressions are common in the criminal statutes of other states. \n10\n This statute presents no greater uncertainty or difficulty, in application to necessarily varying facts, than has been repeatedly sanctioned by this court. Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 377\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 780; Miller v. Strahl, \n239 \nU.S. 426, 434\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 147. Furthermore, any danger to sheep men which might otherwise arise from indefiniteness, is removed by section 6314 of Revised Codes, which provides that:\n'In every crime or public offence there must exist a union, or joint operation, of act and intent, or criminal negligence.' \n\n[246 U.S. 343, 349]\n\u00a0\n Third. It is further contended that the statute is in direct conflict with the Act of Congress of February 25, 1885.11 That statute which was designed to prevent the \n\n[246 U.S. 343, 350]\n\u00a0\n illegal fencing of public lands, contains at the close of section 1 the following clause with which the Idaho statute is said to conflict:\n\n'And the assertion of a right to the exclusive use and occupancy of any part of the public lands of the United\n\n___ occupied said lands under the land laws of the United States, claiming title thereto, in good faith.\n'Sec. 4. That any person violating any of the provisions hereof, whether as owner, part owner, or agent, or who shall aid, abet, counsel, advise, or assist in any violation hereof, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and fined in a sum not exceeding one thousand dollars or be imprisoned not exceeding one year, or both, for each offense. [As amended by Act March 10, 1908, c. 75 (35 Stat. 40).]\n\n'Sec. 5. That the President is hereby authorized to take such measures as shall be necessary to remove and destroy any unlawful inclosure of any of said lands, and to employ civil or military force as may be necessary for that purpose.\n\n'Sec. 6. That where the alleged unlawful inclosure includes less than one hundred and sixty acres of land, no suit shall be brought under the provisions of this act without authority from the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n'Sec. 7. That nothing herein shall affect any pending suits to work their discontinuance, but as to them hereafter they shall be prosecuted and determined under the provisions of this act.\n\n'Approved, February 25th, 1885.' \n\n[246 U.S. 343, 351]\n\u00a0\n States in any state or any of the territories of the United States, without claim, color of title, or asserted right as above specified as to inclosure, is likewise declared unlawful, and hereby prohibited.'\n\n An examination of the federal act in its entirety makes it clear that what the clause quoted from section 1 sought to prohibit was merely the assertion of an exclusive right to use or occupation by force or intimidation or by what would be equivalent in effect to an inclosure. That this was the intent of Congress is confirmed by the history of the act. The reports of the Secretary of the Interior upon whose recommendation the act was introduced, the reports of the committees of Congress, and the debates thereon indicate that this alone was the evil sought to be remedied,12 and to such action only does its prohibition appear to have been applied in practice. \n13\n Although Idaho had, by statute, excluded sheep from portions of the public domain since 1875, no reference to the fact has been found in the discussion which preceded and followed the enactment of the federal law, nor does any reference seem to have been made to the legislation of other states which likewise excluded sheep, under certain circumstances, from parts of the public do- \n\n[246 U.S. 343, 352]\n\u00a0\n main.14] And no case has been found in which it was even urged that these state statutes were in conflict with this act of Congress.\n The Idaho statute makes no attempt to grant a right to use public lands. McGinnis v. Friedman, 2 Idaho (Hasb.) 393, 17 Pac. 635. The state, acting in the exercise of its police power, merely excludes sheep from certain ranges under certain circumstances. Like the forcible entry and detainer act of Washington which was held in Denee v. Ankeny (decided March 4, 1918) \n246 U.S. 208\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 226, 62 L. Ed. --, not to conflict with the homestead laws, the Idaho statute was enacted primarily to prevent breaches of the peace. The incidental protection which it thereby affords to cattle owners does not purport to secure to any of them, or to cattle owners collectively, 'the exclusive use and occupancy of any part of the public lands.' For every range from which sheep are excluded remains open not only to all cattle, but also to horses, of which there are many in Idaho.15 This exclusion of sheep owners under certain circumstances does not interefere with any rights of a citizen of the Unite States. Congress has not conferred upon citizens the right to graze stock upon the public lands. The government has merely suffered the lands to be so used. Buford v. Houtz, supra. It is because the citizen possesses no such right, that it was held by this court that the Secretary of Agriculture might, in the exercise of his general power to regulate forest reserves, exclude sheep and cattle therefrom. United States v. Grimaud, \n220 U.S. 506\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 480; Light v. United States, \n220 U.S. 523\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 485. \n\n[246 U.S. 343, 353]\n\u00a0\n All the objections urged against the validity of the statute are unsound.

ALLEN(1918)\nNo. 288\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Robert J. Smith, of Piqua, Ohio, for appellant.\n Mr. Oren Britt Brown, of Dayton, Ohio, for appellees.\n\n Memorandum opinion by the CHIEF JUSTICE.\n The 'Conservancy Act of Ohio' is the name given the statute by its first section. Its seventy-nine sections are thus epitomized in the title:\n'To prevent floods, to protect cities, villages, farms and highways from inundation, and to authorize the organization of drainage and conservation districts.' Ohio Gen. Code,  6828-1 to 6828-79; Laws of Ohio, vol. 104, p. 13.\n\n The statute was admittedly designed to prevent the recurrence of the unprecedented and disastrous flood which invaded the Miami Valley in 1913. Briefly, there was provision for drainage districts, for boards to plan, construct and maintain the works contemplated, with the right to \n\n[248 U.S. 35, 36]\n\u00a0\n exert eminent domain, and to raise money by taxation, by assessments for benefits, and, in some cases, by issue of bonds. Every person affected who was aggrieved was undoubtedly given ample means by the statute to test judicially his grievance.\n A district was organized embracing land along each side of the Miami river which had been flooded in 1913 or which was required for reservoir sites or for furnishing material.\n The appellant, a citizen of California owning property within this district, filed his bill to enjoin the enforcement of the statute on the ground that it was repugnant to both the Constitution of the state and that of the United States. The court, organized under section 266 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1162 [Comp. St. 1916,  1243]), in a careful and clear opinion disposed adversely of every proposition upon which the contention was based. The injunction was refused. This direct appeal was taken.\n All the contentions rest upon one or the other or both of two propositions: (1) That the statute is unconstitutional because of some particular provision relied upon; and (2) because of the inherent want of constitutional authority by government to exert the powers which the statute gave. The first assumes that the statute has a significance which the Supreme Court of Ohio has expressly decided it has not, and, in addition, that the Constitution of the state forbids the exertion of a legislative power which the same court has expressly held the Legislature possessed. The second disregards a line of conclusive decisions of this court which leave nothing open for controversy, or, which is tantamount thereto, separates expressions in opinions of this court from their context in order to give to them a meaning which the opinions do not sanction and which it has been repeatedly declared would be inconsistent with the decided cases.\n Thus concluding, we think nothing is required to dis pose \n\n[248 U.S. 35, 37]\n\u00a0\n of the controversy but to cite the two lines of cases referred to.

Laylin and Frank Davis, Jr., both of Columbus, Ohio, for the State of Ohio.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiffs in error sued the state of Ohio for damages for flooding lands by elevating the spillway of a state-maintained dam. The Supreme Court of the state affirmed the action of the lower courts in dismissing the petition on the ground that the state had not consented so to be sued, and we are asked to review this decision.\n The plaintiffs in error agree, as they must, that their suit cannot be maintained without the consent of the state, but they claim that such consent was given in an amendment to section 16 of article 1 of the state Constitution, adopted in 1912, which reads:\n'Suits may be brought against the state, in such courts and in such manner, as may be provided by law.'\n\n The state Supreme Court held that this amendment is not self- executing, and that the General Assembly of the state having failed to designate the courts and the manner in which such suits might be brought, effective consent to sue had not been given. This decision, the plaintiffs in error claim, vaguely and indefinitely, somehow deprives them of their property without due process of law, in \n\n[248 U.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n The right of individuals to sue a state, in either a federal or a state court, cannot be derived from the Constitution or laws of the United States.

Whether Ohio gave the required consent must be determined by the construction to be given to the constitutional amendment quoted, and this is a question of local state law, as to which the decision of the state Supreme Court is controlling with this court, no federal right being involved.

It forbids the sale of farm produce on commission without an annual license, to be procured from the State Board of Agriculture upon a proper showing as to character, responsibility, etc., and a bond conditioned to make honest accounting. A fee of $10 is required. \n\n[248 U.S. 112, 113]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiffs in error maintain that the statute is class legislation which abridges their rights and privileges, that it deprives them of the equal protection of the laws and also of their property without due process of law-all in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Manifestly, the purpose of the state was to prevent certain evils incident to the business of commission merchants in farm products by regulating it.

EISNER(1918)\nNo. 705\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Henry W. Clark, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case arose under the federal Income Tax Act of October 3, 1913 ( 38 Stat. 114, 166, c. 16). The controversy is over the first cause of action set up by plaintiff in error in a suit against the collector for the recovery of an additional tax exacted in respect of a certain dividend \n\n[247 U.S. 347, 348]\n\u00a0\n received by plaintiff in the year 1914 the facts being as follows: On and prior to March 1, 1913, and thenceforward until payment of the dividend in question, petitioner was owner of 1,100 shares (out of a total of 2,000, 000 shares outstanding) of common stock of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, of the par value of $100 each, and during the same period the company had large holdings of the common and preferred stocks of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company. On March 2, 1914, the Union Pacific declared and paid an extra dividend upon each share of its common stock, amounting to $3 in cash, $12 in par value of preferred stock of the Baltimore & Ohio, and $22.50 in par value of the common stock of the same company; the result being that petit oner received as his dividend upon his holding of Union Pacific common stock $3,300 in cash, 132 shares of Baltimore & Ohio preferred and 247 1\/2 shares of Baltimore & Ohio common stock. In his income return for 1914 he included as taxable income $4.12 per share of this dividend, or $4,532 in all, and paid his tax upon the basis of this return. Afterwards he was subjected to an additional assessment upon a valuation of the balance of his dividend, and this, having been paid under protest, is the subject of the present suit, the theory of which is that the entire earnings, income, gains, and profits from all sources realized by the Union Pacific Railroad Company from March 1, 1913, to March 2, 1914, remaining after the payment of prior charges, did not exceed $4.12 per share of the Union Pacific common stock, and that the cash and Baltimore & Ohio stock disposed of in the extra dividend (so far as they exceeded the value of $4.12 per share of Union Pacific) did not constitute a gain, profit, or income of the Union Pacific, and therefore did not constitute a gain, profit, or income of the plaintiff arising or accruing either in or for the year 1914 or for any period subsequent to March 1, 1913, the date when the Income \n\n[247 U.S. 347, 349]\n\u00a0\n Tax Law took effect. The District Court overruled this contention upon the authority of Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, Collector, 238 Fed. 847, and Towne v. Eisner, Collector, 242 Fed. 702. The latter case has since been reversed (\n245 U.S. 418\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 158, 62 L. Ed. --), but only upon the ground that it related to a stock dividend which in fact took nothing from the property of the corporation and added nothing to the interest of the shareholder, but merely changed the evidence which represented that interest. Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, Collector, \n247 U.S. 330\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 540, 62 L. Ed. --, has been reversed this day, but only upon the ground that the Central Pacific Railway Company, which paid the dividence, and the Southern Pacific Company, which received it, were in substance identical corporations because of the complete ownership and control which the latter possessed over the former as stockholder and in other capacities, so that which paid the dividend, and the Southern entities, yet in fact and for all practical purposes the former was but a part of the latter, acting merely as its agent and subject in all things to its direction and control, and for the further reason that the funds represented by the dividend were in the actual possession and control of the Southern Pacific Company as well before as after the declaration of the dividend. In this case the plaintiff in error stands in the position of the ordinary stockholder, whose interest in the accumulated earnings and surplus of the company are not the same before as after the declaration of a dividend; his right being merely to have the assets devoted to the proper business of the corporation and to receive from the current earnings or accumulated surplus such dividends as the directors in their discretion may declare, and without right or power on his part to control that discretion.\n It hardly is necessary to say that this case is not ruled by our decision in Towne v. Eisner, since the dividend of Baltimore & Ohio shares was not a stock dividend but \n\n[247 U.S. 347, 350]\n\u00a0\n a distribution in specie of a portion of the assets of the Union Pacific, and is to be governed for all present purposes by the same rule applicable to the distribution of a like value in money. It is controlled by Lynch, Collector, v. Hornby, \n247 U.S. 339\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 543, 62 L. Ed. --, this day decided.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENDLETON v. BENNER LINE(1918)\nNo. 178\nArgued: Decided: March 25, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 353, 354]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harvey D. Goulder, of Cleveland, Ohio, and Avery F. Cushman, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. D. Roger Englar, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel brought by the Benner Line against the Pendleton brothers upon a charter party purporting to be made between 'Pendleton Bros., agents of the schooner, 'Edith Olcott\" and the libelant, and signed 'Pendleton Brothers.' The ground of the suit is that the vessel was unseaworthy at the beginning of the voyage and that by reason thereof she sank and her entire cargo was lost. Both Courts below held that the unseaworthiness was proved, and on the evidence that question may be laid on one side. As one of the Pendleton brothers was not interested in the vessel he was dismissed from the suit without objection. The other, the petitioner, who signed the firm name, being a part owner, was held by the District Court to be bound by the warranty of seaworthiness contained in the contract, but entitled to the statutory limitation of liability. Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121,  18, 23 Stat. 57 (Comp. St. 1916,  8028); 210 Fed. 67. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the statute did not cover the case. 217 Fed. 497, 133 C. C. A. 349. A decree was entered against the petitioner for the total loss. Both Courts agreed that the Benner Line although owning none of the cargo was entitled to sue for the loss of it and this proposition and the matter of the applicability of the Act of 1884 are the two questions argued here.\n The ground on which the right of the Benner Line to \n\n[246 U.S. 353, 355]\n\u00a0\n recover the value of the cargo is denied is that the anomalous doctrine by which a bailee can recover the value of goods that he does not own (The Beaconsfield, \n158 \nU.S. 503, 507\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 860), stands on the bailment, and that here there was no bailment to the Benner Line. The charter party provides that bills of lading be signed without prejudice to the charter. The bills of lading were signed by the master or agents of the vessel (the Benner Line), and, it is contended, bound only the vessel. The charter was not a demise of the ship, and it may be assumed, as the bill of lading seems to assume, that the technical possession of the goods was in the ship owners, since they remained in possession of the ship. The Benner Line has not paid or been called upon to pay anything to the owners of the cargo, but brings this suit at the request of the underwriters on the same, who have paid for the loss.\n But as was observed by the Courts below, the Benner Line held itself out to the public as a common carrier, solicited and received the merchandise that it offered to transport by acceptance of such merchandise contracted to be answerable for the transportation, chartered the vessels to carry what it received, employed the stevedores who put it aboard, ixed and received the freight and signed or had the bills of lading signed in its office. It determined the vessel on which the cargo should go as against the owners of it or of the ship. The cargo went in the space it had hired. We agree with the lower Courts that the Benner Line did not disappear from its contract to carry the goods when the bills of lading were signed and that it would have been answerable to the owners, or to the insurance companies when they became subrogated to the owners rights, if they had elected to sue it. The owners of the vessel had warranted the seaworthiness of the ship to the charterer, of course in contemplation that a cargo would be shipped as to which they would be liable in some form. Wherever in theory of law the tech- \n\n[246 U.S. 353, 356]\n\u00a0\n nical possession may have been, we do not perceive why the charterer should be denied full damages upon the express contract when its liability over also was determined by contract exactly as was expected. The ground upon which bailees have been allowed to recover the full value of goods from wrongdoers has been stated for centuries to be their liability over. Y. B. 9 Ed. IV, 34, pl. 9, is an example of what has been repeated from that day to this. See Brewster v. Warner, 136 Mass. 57, 59, 49 Am. Rep. 5. Whatever may be the inadequacy, in history or theory, of the reason as applied to torts, it applies with real force to contract relations like those in this case. The whole question is hardly more than technical as there is no doubt that this suit really represents the owners' interests since it is brought at the request of the insurers who have paid the loss.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 353, 2]\n\u00a0\n On the proposition that the petitioner is entitled to limit his liability under the act of 1884 it is urged that the act is an absolute limit, irrespective of privity or knowledge, in regard to contracts as well as torts, and that this contract, if it bound the petitioner at all, did so only as an indirect result of its execution. The last point hardly is intelligible. The petitioner signed the charter with the name Pendleton Brothers, which included himself, and apart from the fact that although described as agents the Pendleton brothers purport to be contracting parties, if we look only to the principals the petitioner was one of them as part owner of the vessel. The contract was between human beings and the petitioner by his own act knowingly made himself a party to an express undertaking for the seaworthiness of the ship. That the statute does not limit liability for the personal acts of the owners done with knowledge is established by Richardson v. Harmon, \n222 U.S. 96\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 27. It was said in that case, \n222 U.S. 106\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 27, 56 L. ed. 110, that section 18 leaves the owner 'liable for his own fault, neglect and contracts.' The principle was held to \n\n[246 U.S. 353, 357]\n\u00a0\n apply to contracts less personal than this in Great Lakes Towing Co. v. Mill Transportation Co., 155 Fed. 11, 83 C. C. A. 607, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 769, and in The Loyal, 204 Fed. 930, 123 C. C. A. 252. We are not disposed to disturb the very strong and deliberate intimations of Richardson v. Harmon in their application to the present case. It is said that the owners did their best to make the vessel seaworthy and that if it was not so the failure was wholly without the privity or knowledge of the petitioner. But that is not the material question in the case of a warranty. Unless the petitioner can be discharged from his contract altogether he must answer for the breach whether he was to blame for it or not.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE'S TOBACCO CO. v.

Merrick, of New Orleans, La., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 79, 82]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Junius Parker, of New York City, and George Denegre, Victor Leovy, and Henry H. Chaffe, all of New Orleans, La., for defendant in error. \n\n[246 U.S. 79, 83]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On January 4, 1912, the People's Tobacco Company, Limited, began suit against the American Tobacco Company in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana to recover treble damages under section 7 of the Sherman Act of 1890 (Act July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 210 [Comp. St. 1916,  8829]). On January 5, 1912, service of process was made upon W. R. Irby as manager of the company. On January 16, 1912, the company filed exceptions to the service on the ground that it was a corporation organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey; that it was not found within the Eastern District of Louisiana or in the State of Louisiana, and was not engaged in business there, nor had it an agent therein; that W. R. Irby, upon whom service had been attempted, was not an officer, agent, or employe of the defendant, the American Tobacco Company, or authorized to accept service of process upon it at that time. On January 25, 1912, service was made upon the Assistant Secretary of State of Louisiana. Exceptions to that service upon practically the same grounds were filed by the defendant company. A further service was undertaken on February 2, 1914, on the Secretary of State of Louisiana and like exceptions were filed by the defendant company to that service.\n Testimony was taken and upon hearing the District Court held that:\n\n 1. \nW. R. Irby was not the agent of the company at the time of the attempted service, and, therefore, the service upon him did not bring the company into court;\n\n 2. \nThat the American Tobacco Company was not doing business in Louisiana at the time of the attempted service;\n\n 3. \nThat the attempted service upon the Secretary of State of Louisiana did not bring the defendant corporation into court. \n\n[246 U.S. 79, 84]\n\u00a0\n Section 7 of the Sherman Act provides that suits of the character of the one now under consideration may be brought in the district in which the defendant 'resides or is found.' When applied to a corporation this requirement is the equivalent of saying that it must be present in the district by its officers and agents carrying on the business of the corporation. In this way only can a corporation be said to be 'found' within the district. In that manner it may manifest its submission to local jurisdiction and become amenable to local process.\n The testimony shows that up to November 30, 191 , the American Tobacco Company had a factory in New Orleans for the manufacture of tobacco and cigarettes known as the W. R. Irby Branch of the American Tobacco Company, of which W. R. Irby was manager. Under the law of the State it had filed in the office of the Secretary of State an appointment of W. R. Irby as agent, upon whom service of process might be made.\n On November 16, 1911, the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York made a decree dissolving the American Tobacco Company. Among other things that decree provided that the American Tobacco Company should convey its W. R. Irby Branch to a company to be formed and known as the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company. Conveyances were made to carry out this purpose.\n The American Tobacco Company by an instrument executed by Mr. Hill, its vice president, revoked the authority of W. R. Irby as its resident agent, and filed the revocation of authority in the office of the Secretary of State of Louisiana on December 15, 1911. W. R. Irby testified that thereafter he was the manager of the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, and that he had no connection whatsoever with the American Tobacco Company, nor had he drawn any salary from that company since December 1, 1911. \n\n[246 U.S. 79, 85]\n\u00a0\n It is true that the record discloses some instances in which collections were made upon bills in the name of the Irby Branch of the American Tobacco Company after the revocation of Mr. Irby's authority as its agent. Most of them were stamped across the face, Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company.\n There remained on hand with the Irby Branch at the time of the dissolution a quantity of cigarette paper which was continued to be delivered to purchasers by the employes of the Irby Branch of the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company upon orders received from the American Tobacco Company, and for its benefit and upon its account. This practically continued until the stock was exhausted, which the testimony shows was within a month after the dissolution, and before the attempted service of process in this case.\n There were lodged in the custom house in New Orleans powers of attorney of the American Tobacco Company giving authority to those named therein to do what was necessary to make out export papers on behalf of the company. These powers of attorney do not appear to have been revoked, and existed after the service of process. The defendant company issued circulars subsequent to the time it was served with process in this suit; it also advertised in the New Orleans newspapers.\n A consideration of all the testimony leads us to the conclusion that the American Tobacco Company undertook in good faith to carry out the decree of dissolution, and to take that company out of business in the State of Louisiana. It is true, as found by the District Court, that at the time of the service, and thereafter, the American Tobacco Company was selling goods in Louisiana to jobbers, and sending its drummers into that State to solicit orders of the retail trade, to be turned over to the jobbers, the charges being made by the jobbers to the retailers. It further appears that these agents were not \n\n[246 U.S. 79, 86]\n\u00a0\n domiciled in the State, and did not have the right or authority to make sales on account of the defendant company, collect money, or extend credit for it. It also appears that the American Tobacco Company owned stock in other companies which owned stock in companies carrying on the tobacco business in the State of Louisiana. With these facts in mind we come to a consideration of the proper disposition of the case.\n We agree with the District Court that Irby at the time of the attempted service upon him was not the authorized agent of the American Tobacco Company. On December 1, 1911, the American Tobacco Company conveyed its Irby Branch to the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company. On the same day W. R. Irby, who had been the designated agent of the defendant company, resigned as a director of the American Tobacco Company, and ceased to remain in it employment. On December 5, 1911, the power of attorney was revoked as we have hereinbefore stated by the company filing an instrument of revocation in the office of the Secretary of State of Louisiana; it is true that the revocation was by one of the vice presidents of the company and was attested by the seal of the corporation. But we are not impressed with the argument that this revocation was ineffectual because not sanctioned by formal action of the board of directors of the company. The vice president seems to have had authority in the matter. Apparently he acted with the knowledge and acquiescence of the corporation, and was carrying into effect the decree of dissolution.\n Upon the broader question, we agree with the District Court that the American Tobacco Company at the time of the attempted service was not doing business within the State of Louisiana. The question as to what constitutes the doing of business in such wise as to make the corporation subject to service of process has been frequently discussed in the opinions of this court, and we \n\n[246 U.S. 79, 87]\n\u00a0\n shall enter upon no amplification of what has been said. Each case depends upon its own facts. The general rule deducible from all our decisions is that the business must be of such nature and character as to warrant the inference that the corporation has subjected itself to the local jurisdiction, and is by its duly authorized officers or agents present within the state or district where service is attempted. Phila. & Reading R. R. Co. v. McKibbin, \n243 U.S. 264\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 280; St. Louis Southwestern R. R. Co. v. Alexander, \n227 \nU.S. 218, 226\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 245, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 77.\n The fact that the company owned stock in the local subsidiary companies did not bring it into the State in the sense of transacting its own business there. Peterson v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. R. Co., \n205 U.S. 364\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 513; Phila. & Reading R. R. Co. v. McKibbin, \n243 \nU.S. 264, 268\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 280. As to the continued practice of advertising its wares in Louisiana, and sending its soliciting agents into that State, as above detailed, the agents having no authority beyond solicitation, we think the previous decisions of this court have settled the law to be that such practices did not amount to that doing of business which subjects the corporation to the local jurisdiction for the purpose of service of process upon it. Green v. C. B . & Q. R. R. Co., \n205 U.S. 530\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 595; Phila. & Reading R. R. Co. v. McKibbin, \n243 \nU.S. 264, 268\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 280.\n The plaintiff in error relies upon International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 U.S. 579\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 944, but in that case the facts disclosed that there was not only a continuous course of business in the solicitation of orders within the State, but there was also authority upon the part of such agents to receive payment in money, checks and drafts on behalf of the company, and to take notes payable and collectible at banks in Kentucky; these things, taken together, we held amounted to doing business within the State of Kentucky in such manner as to make the Har- \n\n[246 U.S. 79, 88]\n\u00a0\n vester Company amenable to the process of the courts of that State.\n As to the attempted service of process upon the Secretary of State of Louisiana under the Louisiana Act of 1904 (Act No. 54 of 1904) as amended 1908 (Act No. 284 of 1908), we understand the Act, as construed by the State Supreme Court, is not applicable to foreign corporations not present within the State and doing business therein at the time of the service, and having as in this case withdrawn from the State and ceased to do business there. Gouner v. Missouri Valley Iron Co., 123 La. 964, 49 South. 657.\n We reach the conclusion that the District Court did not err in maintaining the exceptions filed by the defendant company and in quashing the attempted service made upon it.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLD took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPERLMAN v. U S(1918)\nNo. 752\nArgued: April 18, 1918Decided: May 6, 1918\n\n\n\n Decided May 6, 1918. \n\n[247 U.S. 7, 8]\n\u00a0\n Appeal and error to review an order denying petition of Perlman to restrain and enjoin the United States attorney for the Southern district of New York from taking into his possession or custody certain exhibits which had been impounded and deposited by order of the district court for that district with the clerk of the court.\n In support of the relief prayed Perlman alleges the following facts, which we state narratively: He is the inventor of a device known in the market as a demountable rim, its purpose being to mount and carry an inflated pneumatic tire upon a metallic rim, which contains locking devices for attachment to the wheels of automobiles and other vehicles.\n He brought suit for infringement against the Standard Welding Company, and, issue being joined, there was a judgment for him against the company, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. (D. C.) 231 Fed. 453, 231 Fed. 734, 146 C. C. A. 18. At the trial of the cause certain exhibits hereinafter referred to were offered by him which were and are his personal property and have been continuously in his possession or in the possession of those who represent him.\n Subsequently he, with others, formed a corporation known as the Perlman Rim Corporation, which, among other things, undertook to market the patented device.\n n March, 1916, he assigned the letters patent to the corporation, but not the exhibits above mentioned.\n In February, 1917, the corporation, being advised that the Firestone Tire & Rubber Company was infringing the device, brought suit against the company for infringement, which came up for trial before Judge Hand. After final submission of the case the plaintiff, the Perlman Rim Corporation, through its counsel, asked leave to discontinue the action and for its dismissal without prejudice. \n\n[247 U.S. 7, 9]\n\u00a0\n The motion was granted, but the condition was imposed that the evidence be perpetuated and the exhibits impounded in the custody of the clerk, to be kept under seal subject to the order of the court. \n1\n The exhibits were part of those heretofore referred to and used on the trial before Judge Hunt.\n July 17, 1917, Perlman ascertained from the attorney for the corporation that the attorney had been served with a copy of an order signed by Judge Hand, directing him, the attorney for the corporation, and the attorney for the Firestone Company to appear and show cause why the United States attorney should not have and be given possession of the exhibits as the United States attorney had instituted proceedings against Perlman which involved the question whether he had committed an offense against the United States. The attorney for the corporation also told Perlman that he had not opposed the motion and that the attorney for the Firestone Company had not appeared; that, therefore, the order would be entered as a matter of course.\n The application of the United States attorney was based \n\n[247 U.S. 7, 10]\n\u00a0\n on an affidavit of one Harold Harper, an assistant to the United States attorney, which charged, among other things, that the exhibits were material and necessary in an investigation pending before The grand jury and for preparation for trial in case an indictment should be found.\n The exhibits are his, Perlman's, personal property and the use of them by the grand jury and the United States attorney as contemplated would be in violation of his rights and unwarranted in law; they were impounded in a suit to which he was not a party, but a witness, and he had not consented thereto or been heard by counsel.\n He prayed for an order upon all the parties concerned to show cause why an order should not be made directing the clerk to deliver to him, Perlman, the exhibits and that the United States attorney be restrained from using them, and that unless such stay be granted, his rights would be seriously invaded and he would be compelled to furnish evidence against himself in a criminal proceeding, all without due process of law.\n A schedule of the exhibits is attached to the petition and shows them to be not only matters in writing, such as bills, letters and checks, but models of wheels, rim-carrying tires, and of other implements and tools, and the patent upon which the suit was brought.\n Before the filing of the petition an order had been granted upon motion of the United States attorney directing the clerk to produce the exhibits before the grand jury. The order further directed that the United States attorney have access to the exhibits at all reasonable times and that if an indictment should be found against Perlman the United States attorney might have such temporary custody of the exhibits or any part thereof as might be necessary for the purpose, under such regulations as the clerk might make.\n Upon the filing of Perlman's petition an order was granted restraining the use of the exhibits until the \n\n[247 U.S. 7, 11]\n\u00a0\n hearing of the petition. Subsequently, upon the hearing, and Perlman having withdrawn so much of his application as related to the return of the exhibits to him, the court, Judge Manton sitting, denied the relief prayed for against the use of the exhibits by the United States attorney or their presentation to the United States grand jury.\n The order recited that it was made upon the order of Judge Hand, the petition of Perlman and the affidavit of Harper.\n The affidavit gives some detail that Perlman's petition does not. It states that Perlman testified that he had been president of the Perlman Rim Corporation since its formation and further that he gave testimony in respect to the alleged invention which was the subject of the patent, and that in the course of his testimony he produced and offered in evidence on the part of the corporation the exhibits. And the affidavit states that the impounding of the exhibits was part of the decree in the suit against the Firestone Company and that Perlman was present at the time and during practically all of the proceedings of the trial and that the minutes of the court show no protest by him.\n It further states that certain of the alleged perjuries committed by Perlman referred directly to the exhibits, as to the time and manner of their production or alteration; and that certain other statements alleged to have been perjured were made by him and supported by the exhibits. And further that in the course of his cross-examination Perlman gave certain evidence with regard to events in England in the year 1895 which did not directly concern the matter of invention but went to the credibility of the witness as such, and in respect to those statements an indictment had been found against Perlman by the grand jury attending the court for the July, 1917, term.\n The sources of information of Harper as to the above \n\n[247 U.S. 7, 12]\n\u00a0\n matters not within his own knowledge were stated to be the official stenographic report of the trial, the records of the clerk's office, and statements made to him by persons who had been present in the court room during the trial and cognizant of the proceedings.\n Mr. Louis Marshall, of New York City, for appellant and plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Fitts for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States makes a motion to dismiss on the following grounds:\n'1. Appellant has no interest in the subject matter of and is not a party to the equity suit out of which the appeal arises;\n\n'2. The order of the District Court if considered as a part of the criminal proceeding is not final, but merely interlocutory, and therefore not reviewable by this court.'\n\n We think the motion should be overruled. Referring to the impounding order it will be seen that the government was not one of those for whom the use of the exhibits was reserved. It, therefore, had no rights under the order. Its rights-or, it is more accurate to say, its powers-were of different origin, were governmental, and would affect Perlman by their exercise. We think, therefore, that he could intervene to oppose and urge in opposition property and constitutional rights and their sanctions. His petition was in effect independent and did not lose its character by being entitled in the equity suit.\n The second contention of the government is somewhat \n\n[247 U.S. 7, 13]\n\u00a0\n strange, that is, that the order granted upon its solicitation was not final as to Perlman but interlocutory in a proceeding not yet brought and depending upon it to be brought. In other words, that Perlman was powerless to avert the mischief of the order but must accept its incidence and seek a remedy at some other time and in some other way. We are unable to concur.\n On the merits the case is rather unique. Perlman contends that the proposed use by the United States before the grand jury of the exhibits as a basis for an indictment against him constitutes an unreasonable seizure and makes of him a compulsory witness against himself, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. In other words, he claims the same sanctuary for the exhibits in the hands of the court as though they were in his hands and had never been published or delivered to the world. For this he invokes certain principles and cases. The principles are well established. They are paraphrases of the Constitution, giving it in cases a more precise specialization. They preclude, of course, compulsion, either upon t e individual or, under some circumstances, his property; nor is it a condition or part of compulsion that there be an actual entry upon premises, an actual search and seizure. The principles preclude as well the extortion of testimony or detrimental inferences from silence or refusals to testify.\n The incidences of the cases in which the principles were declared do not help Perlman. In all of them there was force or threats or trespass upon property, some invasion of privacy or governmental extortion. In Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 524, there was an order of the court requiring the production of private books, invoices and papers, the alternative of refusal being that their character as asserted by counsel should be taken as confessed. In Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 U.S. 547\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 195, there was an effort to compel a witness to disclose circumstances which might be \n\n[247 U.S. 7, 14]\n\u00a0\n evidence against him of the commission of an offense or might connect him with it. Hale v. Henkel, \n201 U.S. 43\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 370, is of like illustration. In United States v. Wong Quong Wong (D. C.) 94 Fed. 832, private letters were opened. In United States v. Mills (C. C.) 185 Fed. 318, there was a general seizure of all of the defendant's business records by the United States marshal when executing a warrant of arrest. In United States v. Abrams (D. C.) 230 Fed. 313, business papers were delivered to an officer under threats or promises of benefit. In Weeks v. United States, \n232 U.S. 383\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177, there was an invasion of premises without a search warrant and the carrying away of certain letters and envelopes. The latter case is especially relied on by counsel, and it is definite as to principles and as to seizures the Constitution forbids and those it permits. The distinctions are made clear and the discussion leaves nothing to be added of either principles or their illustration. But it is not like the case at bar. In it there was an invasion of the defendant's privacy, a taking from his immediate and personal possession. In the case at bar there was a voluntary exposition of the articles, for use as evidence in the Circuit Court and in the Circuit Court of Appeals ( D. C.) 231 Fed. 453, 231 Fed. 734, 146 C. C. A. 18, that judicial action should be based upon them, action prayed for by him against another. And they served his purpose; they prevailed as proof and secured a judgment for him.\n There was again exposition of them and use as evidence in Perlman Rim Co. v. Firestone Co. (D. C.) 244 Fed. 304. In that case, it is true, Perlman was not nominally a party, but he was interested in the suit and its success. His patent depended upon it. They were part of his evidence, necessary supports and illustrations of it, as much, therefore, a part of his testimony as his spoken word, as much a part of the records of the court as the stenographer's notes. Their tangibility did not change their character as evidence. Indeed, it gave emphasis to the notes and \n\n[247 U.S. 7, 15]\n\u00a0\n a more pertinent strength, and was deemed necessary to their completeness and understanding. As is usual in a patent case, there was exposition and illustration by exhibits. And their production was voluntary, no form of constraint or compulsion or extortion was put upon him, and that some one of them must exist is the test of immunity. Holt v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 245, 252\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 2, 20 Ann. Cas. 1138. Therefore, as said by counsel for the government:\n'Having let go the exhibits, so that they have become a part of the judicial records, he is not now in position to suppress the story they tell.'\n\n But Perlman insists that he owned the exhibits and appears to contend that his ownership exempted them from any use by the government without his consent. The extent of the insistence is rather elusive of measurement. It seems to be that the owner of property must be considered as having a constructive possession of it whe ever it be and in whosesoever hands it be, and is always, therefore, in a kind of asylum of constitutional privilege. And to be of avail the contention must be pushed to this extreme. It is opposed, however, by all the cited cases. They, as we have said, make the criterion of immunity not the ownership of property but the 'physical or moral compulsion' exerted.\n As we have seen, Perlman delivered the exhibits to publicity, made them the means of advantage. They, for the purposes of justice, were taken from his possession and volition into the control and custody of the court. Upon formal motion they were released for the use of the government, a use as meritorious in consideration as that which determined the ruling in Ex parte Uppercu, \n239 U.S. 435\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 140.\n Order affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'This cause having come on to be heard and testimony having been taken by both parties, now, on plaintiff's motion, and after hearing defendant's counsel in opposition thereto, it is\n'Ordered, that the bill of complaint herein be and it hereby is dismissed without prejudice with costs to defendant to be taxed; and as a condition of such dismissal and in accordance with plaintiff's stipulation made in open court, it is\n\n'Further ordered, that the minutes of the trial be filed and that all the exhibits offered by either party be impounded and deposited with the clerk of this court under seal to be opened only by order of court on notice to each of the parties hereto; and\n\n'That, all testimony taken up to the present time in this cause (as well as the exhibits) shall stand as testimony which may be read and used in any cause between the parties hereto or between any other parties who would be privies if judgment were entered herein, including cases in which the vendees and users of the rims made or sold by the defendant or such other parties are sued.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPETRIE v.

Haga, of Boise, Idaho, for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. B. E. Stoutemyer, of Boise, Idaho, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Board of Directors of the Nampa & Meridian Irrigation District, a quasi municipal corporation, organized under the laws of Idaho (Pioneer Irrigation District v. Walker, 20 Idaho, 605, 119 Pac. 304; Colburn v. Wilson, 23 Idaho, 337, 130 Pac. 381), filed an amended petition in the district court of that state, praying for the examination, approval, and confirmation by the court of a contract which it desired to enter into with the United States government, acting through the Secretary of the Interior, which provided that the United States should sell and the irrigation district should purchase, and in the manner prescribed pay for, a supply of water to irrigate an extensive tract of arid land within the district, and to supplement an insufficient supply, for other lands, which the district had theretofore acquired from other sources. The proposed contract also provided that the United States and the district should share in the expense of constructing a system of drainage, to reclaim considerable areas of land within the district which had become 'water- logged' \n\n[248 U.S. 154, 156]\n\u00a0\n through seepage from both the government and the district systems of irrigation, and to prevent threatened damage to other lands from such seepage.\n The proceeding involved is prescribed by the state statutes, which provide that when such a petition is filed the court shall fix a day for hearing, and shall notify the persons interested therein by publication, for four weeks, in a newspaper published in the county. Any persons interested in the subject-matter may demur to or answer the petition, and the rules of pleading and practice prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure of the state (Revised Codes Idaho, vol. 1, tit. 14, c. 4,  2397, 2398, and 2401) are made applicable.\n The required notice having been given, the plaintiffs in error, owners of lands within the irrigation district, filed an 'answer and cross- complaint,' in which they denied many allegations of the petition, and affirmatively alleged: That if the contract should be entered into they would be obliged to pay an assessment of $75 upon each acre of their land for water rights which they did not require, because they had a sufficient supply from other sources; that neither the United States, nor the Secretary of the Interior, nor the irrigation district had authority under the laws of the United States to enter into the contract; and that, for these reasons, if it were approved and entered into, the plaintiffs in error would be deprived of their property without due process of law and without compensation, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. A permanent injunction was prayed for, restraining the petitioners from entering into the proposed contract and from levying assessments to carry it into effect.\n The District Court approved the contract, upon a full finding of facts, and its judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state in a judgment which we are asked to review upon this writ of error. \n\n[248 U.S. 154, 157]\n\u00a0\n A motion to dismiss the writ of error was postponed until the hearing upon the merits, which has now been had.\n The statement which we have made of the issues presented by this record shows that the first ground of the motion-that a federal question was not presented-cannot be sustained. Tregea v. Modesto Irrigation District, \n164 \nU.S. 179, 185\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 52.\n But the second ground of the motion to dismiss is valid, viz. that, even if it be conceded that the Supreme Court decided a federal question against the plaintiffs in error, nevertheless the court decided against them also upon an independent ground, not involving any federal question and broad enough to support the judgment, and for this reason the federal question involved will not be considered on this writ of error, under a series of decisions by this court extending at least from Klinger v. State of Missouri. 13 Wall. 257, 263, to Enterprise Irrigation District et al. v. Farmers' Mutual Canal Co., \n243 \nU.S. 157, 164\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 318.\n While the state Supreme Court finds that the United States, acting through the Secretary of the Interior, could lawfully enter into the proposed contract and that the approval and confirmation of it by the court would not deprive the plaintiffs in error of their property without due process of law or without compensation, yet the court also holds that the 'cross-complaint,' in which these federal rights are asserted, was filed prematurely under the statutes and practice of the state of Idaho, and that no charge or burden would be imposed upon the lands of the plaintiffs in error by the approval of the contract, assuming that it should be executed. This for the reason that the state statute provides that any assessments upon such lands to carry into effect the purposes of the contract must subsequently be made by the Board of Directors of the Irrigation District on the basis of benefits conferred, at a meeting of the board, to be held at a time and place of which the owners of the lands to be \n\n[248 U.S. 154, 158]\n\u00a0\n charged must be notified by postal card and by newspaper publication. Revised Codes Idaho, vol. 1, tit. 14, c. 4,  2400. At such meeting the landowner may object to any proposed assessment on his land, and if the objection is overruled by the board, and he does not consent to the assessment as finally determined, such objection shall, without further proceeding, be regarded as appealed to the district court, and shall there again be heard in proceedings to confirm the assessment. It is expressly provided that upon such hearing the court shall disregard every error, irregularity, or omission which does not affect the substantial rights of any party, and shall correct any error which may be found in such assessment, or any injustice which may result from it.\n For this reason the court held that the claims stated in the 'cross- complaint' were prematurely asserted, were 'wholly immaterial' to the inquiry presented by the petition of the district, and 'should have been stricken from the answer.' We cannot doubt that this conclusion of the state Supreme Court, based as it is wholly on state statutes and procedure, is broad enough to sustain the judgment rendered, irrespective of the disposition of any federal question involved, and therefore the writ of error will be dismissed. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPHILIPPINE SUGAR ESTATES DEVELOPMENT CO. v. GOVERNMENT OF(1918)\nNo. 189\nArgued: March 13, 1918Decided: June 3, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 385, 386]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Antonio M. Opisso, of Manila, P. I., for plaintiff in error and appellant.\n Messrs. Edward S. Bailey and Samuel T. Ansell, both of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error and appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n When Spain ceded the Philippine Islands to the United States large tracts of agricultural lands were owned by the great religious orders. For political reasons it was deemed advisable that our government should acquire the Friar lands and sell them to tenants in small holdings on easy terms. Lengthy negotiations conducted to that end by the Civil Governor were concluded in 1903. Most of the lands owned by the Dominicans, amounting to 60,461 hectares, had been conveyed to the Philippine Sugar Estates Development Company, Limited; and with that corporation a contract of sale and purchase was executed by the Government of the Philippine Islands under date of December 22, 1903. The agreement covered eight haciendas including that of Calamba in the \n\n[247 U.S. 385, 387]\n\u00a0\n province of Laguna, said to contain 16,424 hectares and 14 ares. Owing to delays incident to resurveys and perfecting of titles, the deed of the Calamba estate was not delivered until October, 1905, when the purchase price, 1,385,443.29 pesos, was paid and possession taken by the grantee. \n1\n Later the Philippine Government learned that the grantor had removed certain sugar mill machinery and the rails of a light railroad which had formerly been upon the estate. The contract made no mention of sugar mills, machinery, or railroad; but it contained, after the description of the estates and specified properties to be conveyed, the words, 'and all other improvements'; and these words were also in the deed. The government, claiming that the machinery and railroad were covered by this and other clauses and passed as part of the realty, brought suit, in 1906, against the company2 in the Court of First Instance of Manila for their value, alleged to be 50,000 pesos.\n The Code of Civil Procedure of the Philippine Islands (section 285) permits to be introduced, in case of written contracts, 'evidence of the terms of agreement other than the contents of the writing,' 'where a mistake or imperfection of the writing, or its failure to express the true intent and agreement of the parties is put in issue by the pleadings.' \n3\n The defense was rested, under appropriate \n\n[247 U.S. 385, 388]\n\u00a0\n pleadings, on the ground, among others, that the contracting parties understood that the sugar mills or machinery and the railroad were not to be included as a part of the real estate and that they did not come under any of the terms used in the contract or the deed, and that, for this reason, the instrument did not express the intention and actual agreement of the parties. The trial court held this defense good in law and sustained by the evidence; and entered judgment for the defendant. The Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands reversed the judgment of the trial court solely on the ground that, where parties to a written contract have deliberately adopted the language therein used, a court of equity will not reform the instrument because the parties were 'mistaken as to its legal interpretation and effect, nor will such a mistake be recognized as any defense to a suit upon the contract or instrument,' and that relief against such a mistake cannot be afforded under section 285 of the Code. Upon the evidence which had been introduced below the Supreme Court also entered a judgment of 50,000 pesos for the governm nt. 30 Phil. Rep. 27. The case comes here under section 248 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. 1916 ,  1225, 1225a).\n The case is brought here both by writ of error and by appeal. The complaint set forth a cause of action at law on the contract. The answer was, in effect, a bill in equity for reformation and incidentally to enjoin the \n\n[247 U.S. 385, 389]\n\u00a0\n action at law. Compare Bradbury v. Higginson, 167 Cal. 553, 140 Pac. 254. The proceeding became thus an equitable one. See Surgett v. Lapice, 8 How. 48, 64, 65; Clark v. Mosher, 107 N. Y. 118, 14 N. E. 96, 1 Am. St. Rep. 798; Turner v. Johnson, 93 S. W. 1038, 29 Ky. Law Rep. 543. The proper method of review by this court is therefore by appeal, and the writ of error is dismissed. Gsell v. Insular Collector of Customs, \n239 U.S. 93\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 39; Montelibanoy Ramos v. La Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas, \n241 \nU.S. 455, 461\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 617\n\n\n It is well settled that courts of equity will reform a written contract where, owing to mutual mistake, the language used therein did not fully or accurately express the agreement and intention of the parties. The fact that interpretation or construction of a contract presents a question of law and that, therefore, the mistake was one of law is not a bar to granting relief. Snell v. Insurance Co., \n98 U.S. 85\n, 88-91; Griswold v. Hazard, \n141 \nU.S. 260, 283\n, 284 S., 11 Sup. Ct. 972, 999. This rule of equity was adopted in the Philippine Code without restriction; and the relief is afforded, under appropriate pleadings, without resort to an independent suit for reformation of the contract. The language of section 285 is clearly broad enough to include relief for such mistakes of law; and the earlier decisions of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands to which that court refers in its opinion, are not inconsistent with this conclusion. Some of them are instances of the futile attempt to vary, supplement, or contradict a written contract by parol evidence. In none of them was evidence offered under appropriate pleadings with a view to reforming the instrument. \n5\n It is urged that section 285 was \n\n[247 U.S. 385, 390]\n\u00a0\n borrowed from section 1856 of the Code of Civil Procedure of California, and that the courts of that state deny relief under circumstances like those here under consideration. No case sustaining this assertion was cited by counsel and none has been found by us. Furthermore the provisions of the two sections differ materially; the significant clause of section 285, namely, 'or its failure to express the true intent and agreement of the parties,' is not contained in section 1856 of the California Code. It is also urged that, since the construction of section 285 is a matter of purely local concern, we should not disturb the decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands. This court is always disposed to accept the construction which the highest court of a territory or possession has placed upon a local statute. Phoenix Railway Co. v. Landis, \n231 U.S. 578\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 179. But that disposition may not be yielded to, where the lower court has clearly erred. Carrington v. Unites States, \n208 U.S. 1\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 203. Here the construction adopted was rested upon a clearly erroneous assumption as to an established rule of equity. The Supreme Court erred in refusing to consider the evidence of mutual mistake; and its judgment must be reversed.\n It remains to consider the further proceedings which should be taken. The judgment of the trial court was reversed by the Supreme Court solely on the ground that the defense of mutual mistake relied upon was not good in law; but the case had been taken to that court on a bill of exceptions which contained the whole record in the trial court, including all the evidence introduced; and the refusal of the trial judge to grant a new trial on the ground that the evidence did not justify the findings of the court had been duly excepted o. This exception \n\n[247 U.S. 385, 391]\n\u00a0\n was apparently insisted upon before the Philippine Supreme Court, and the same contention is made by the government here. Its purpose was obviously to seek a review of those findings under section 497, par. 2, of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that where a motion was made in the trial court for a new trial 'upon the ground that the evidence was insufficient to justify the decision, and the judge overruled said motion, and due exception was taken to his overruling the same, the Supreme Court may review the evidence and make such findings upon the facts by a preponderance of the evidence, and render such final judgment, as justice and equity may require.' We might require that the review of the evidence to which the government is entitled should be made by that court. But, as the case is here on appeal and all proffered evidence was admitted below and is in the record before us, we may now finally dispose of the case.\n The burden of proof resting upon the appellant cannot be satisfied by mere preponderance of the evidence. It is settled that relief by way of reformation will not be granted, unless the proof of mutual mistake be 'of the clearest and most satisfactory character.' Snell v. Insurance Co., \n98 \nU.S. 85, 89\n, 90 S.; Baltzer v. Raleigh & Augusta Railroad, \n115 \nU.S. 634, 645\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 216; Maxwell Land-Grant Case, \n121 \nU.S. 325, 381\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 1015; Simmons Creek Coal Co. v. Doran, \n142 \nU.S. 417, 435\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 239; Campbell v. Northwest Eckington Co., \n229 \nU.S. 561, 584\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 796. The evidence introduced by appellant meets this stringent requirement.\n The following, among other facts, were established by uncontradicted evidence: Prior to May, 1903, the sugar mills had been in part destroyed by revolutionists, and the mills and machinery had fallen into disrepair. In that month the company gave orders to remove the machinery and the rails from the hacienda and store them elsewhere. In October, 1903, the company contracted to sell all the \n\n[247 U.S. 385, 392]\n\u00a0\n machinery and rails to one Rueda. They were not included in the detailed appraisal of the property which the government caused to be made. Before the contract with the government was executed all the rails and a part of the machinery had been removed from the hacienda. In the typewritten draft of this contract with the government which its counsel prepared and which was submitted by Governor Taft to the company's representative for consideration, it was expressly stated that 'sugar and rice mills and machinery' together with 'irrigation work, dams, tunnels, ditches, and all other improvements thereon' should be included in the 'sale and conveyance.' The company's representative corrected the draft of agreement by striking out with a pen the words 'sugar and rice mills and machinery.' This correction was acquiesced in by the government's representatives; and in the final draft of the contract which was executed December 22, 1903, there was no reference to sugar mills, machinery, or tramway, although the paragraph, as modified, contained the following explicit and detailed provision:\n'This sale and conveyance shall include all the dwelling houses, farm houses, warehouses, camarines and other buildings, irrigation works, dams, tunnels, ditches, and all other improvements, together with all water and other rights and all hereditaments belonging to the company on every part of the estates hereby agreed to be conveyed.'\n\n The words 'sugar mills' were also included in the draft of the final deed of conveyance, but they were stricken out after a conference between the company's representative and the Civil Governor, so that the words do not appear in the final deed of conveyance.\n This clear and uncontradicted testimony as to the agreement actually made is supported by the production of the original draft of the agreement in which the words \n\n[247 U.S. 385, 393]\n\u00a0\n 'sugar and rice mills and machinery' were stricken out n ink, and also by production from the files of the Executive Bureau of the stenographic report of the interview with Governor Wright, above referred to. As against this strong evidence the government can point only to the fact that in the deed, the hacienda is first described as 'the description, area and boundaries' thereof 'appear in the title deeds,' then as it appears from the recent government surveys, and that in the description according to the title deeds, the several sugar mills are named, and following them is the clause, 'though it is believed that these mills were destroyed in part at least, by the revolutionists.' This recital, itself of ambiguous import, is of no significance. This description was in no way relied upon by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands. Their decision was based entirely upon the alleged inclusion of sugar mills and machinery in the phrase, 'improvements and accessories.' As found by the trial judge, the evidence 'shows, without the slightest doubt, that the parties, on striking out said words [the sugar mills] from the document, agreed not to include them in the sale, as demanded by the representative of the vendor, because they were not legally part of the hacienda, for the reason that they had already been sold to Enrique Rueda prior to the preliminary agreement.'\n The judgment entered in the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands is reversed and that entered by the Court of First Instance of Manila is affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.

E. Totten, Inspector of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture, seeking a mandatory injunction requiring the Railroad Company to receive and carry in interstate and foreign commerce shipments of oil, the manufacture of the Melting Company, and to restrain the government inspector from interfering with the shipments.\n A decree in favor of the complainant was rendered in the District Court. 229 Fed. 214. Upon appeal this decree was reversed by the Court of Appeals, and the cause remanded to the District Court, with directions to dismiss the bill. 232 Fed. 694, 146 C. C. A. 620.\n The case arises under the Meat Inspection Acts. Act June 30, 1906, c. 3913, 34 Stat. 674, and Act March 4, 1907, c. 2907, 34 Stat. 1260, 1265. The act provides an elaborate system of inspection of animals before slaughter, and of carcasses after slaughter and of meat-food products, with a view to prevent the shipment of impure, unwholesome, and \n\n[248 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n unfit meat and meat-food products in interstate and foreign commerce. The act in part provides:\n'That for the purposes hereinbefore set forth the Secretary of Agriculture shall cause to be made by inspectors appointed for that purpose an examination and inspection of all meat-food products prepared for interstate or foreign commerce in any slaughtering, meat- canning, salting, packing, rendering, or similar establishment, and for the purposes of any examination and inspection said inspectors shall have access at all times, by day or night, whether the establishment be operated or not, to every part of said establishment; and said inspectors shall mark, stamp, tag, or label as 'Inspected and Passed' all such products found to be sound, healthful, and wholesome, and which contain no dyes, chemicals, preservatives, or ingredients which render such meat or meat-food products unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or unfit for human food; and said inspectors shall label, mark, stamp, or tag as 'Inspected and Condemned' all such products found unsound, unhealthful, and unwholesome, or which contain dyes, chemicals, preservatives, or ingredients which render such meat or meat-food products unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or unfit for human food, and all such condemned meat-food products shall be destroyed for food purposes, as hereinbefore provided, and the Secretary of Agriculture may remove inspectors from any establishment which fails to so destroy such condemned meat-food products. ...'\n\n And the act further provides:\n'That on and after October first, nineteen hundred and six, no person, firm, or corporation shall transport or offer for transportation, and no carrier of interstate or foreign commerce shall transport or receive for transportation from one state or territory or the District of Columbia, to any state or territory or the District of Columbia, or to any place under the jurisdiction of the United \n\n[248 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n States, or to any foreign country, any carcasses or parts thereof, meat, or meat-food products thereof, which have not been inspected, examined, and marked as 'Inspected and Passed,' in accordance with the terms of this act and with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture. ...'\n\n The facts appearing of record so far as we deem them necessary to the decision of the case are:\n The Melting Company has long been engaged in rendering or converting animal fats into various products, including the oil which is the subject- matter of this controversy. At one time the company made oleomargarine, but owing to adverse legislation of the state of Pennsylvania desisted from doing so. Government inspectors were in the works of the Melting Company and inspected and marked the products until 1909 when a controversy arose between the company and the government officers as to the purchase of the fats used by the company. Upon refusal to comply with the orders of such officers, inspection was withdrawn. Whether this action was right or not we do not stop to enquire, since the claim for relief is based upon the allegation that complainant's oil is not a meat-food product within the meaning of the statute.\n After inspection was withdrawn the company continued to ship its oil, but did so under the then regulations of the Department of Agriculture concerning the shipment of fat for industrial use, as 'inedible,' and so marking the receptacle containing the same and making the certificate then required by the Department of Agriculture that it was inedible and not intended for food purposes. On November 1, 1914, the Department adopted a new regulation requiring a certificate to accompany the shipment of such fats claimed not to be food products, stating that the same 'is not capable of being used as food by man, is suitable only for industrial purposes, is not for food purposes, and is of such character or for \n\n[248 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n such a use that denaturing is impracticable.' The regulation permits the shipment of oil for industrial uses after it is 'denatured'; that is, treated with a substance which renders it unfit for food, while still fit for use in industrial purposes. The Melting Company refused to make this certificate, which resulted in the notice to the Railroad Company to refuse to carry the oil, and brought about this suit to compel the carrier to receive and transport it.\n The District Court found that the oil manufactured and shipped by the Melting Company was not within the terms of the act, as it was not a meat- food product, which is prohibited from shipment without inspection. The reasons for reaching that conclusion are set forth in the opinion of the District Judge. 229 Fed. 214, supra. The Circuit Court of Appeals reached the opposite conclusion upon the testimony adduced. 232 Fed. 694, 146 C. C. A. 620, supra.\n An examination of the record satisfies us that the Circuit Court of Appeals reached the right conclusion. The oil here in controversy, the testimony shows, is generally known as 'oleo' oil, and is not 'tallow' oil as that term is generally understood by the trade. Both oils are made from the fat of slaughtered beeves. Oleo oil by itself is seldom used as a food. It is, however, largely used in the manufacture of oleomargarine. In fact it constitutes a large percentage of that product. It is used in cooking for shortening purposes. Made as it is by the Melting Company it has no quality which prevents its use for such food purposes. It is not a tallow oil, distasteful and unfit to use in the making of food products. Without elaborating the discussion, we reach the conclusion that this product was clearly a 'meat-food product,' within the meaning of the statute. It is true that the Melting Company does not sell it as such, and now marks it as 'inedible.' But that does not change the fact that a main use of such oil is in making edible products. The company has no control over the use of the oil after it is shipped, and the record \n\n[248 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n does not disclose what use is made of a large percentage of its product which was shipped abroad at the time this action was begun.\n The enactment of the statute was within the power of Congress in order to prevent interstate and foreign shipment of impure or adulterated meat-food products. The statute does not specifically define a meat-food product. In our view the product of the Melting Company is a meat-food product in the sense of the use of those terms in the statute and as such subject to the regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture. It being such meat-food product the Melting Company could not truthfully claim that it was not capable of being used as food by man, and hence could not make the certificate required.\n The theory of the bill is that the product in question was not within the terms of the act; the District Court reached the conclusion that this theory was the correct one, and so rendered a decree which required the Railroad Company to receive the oil for transportation in interstate and foreign commerce, without inspection, when labelled 'inedible,' and accompanied by the certificate of the Melting Company that such oil is inedible and not intended for food purposes and is of such a character that denaturing is impossible or will render the oil unavailable for the desired industrial use. This decree is consistent only with the finding of the District Court that the product was not a meat-food product within the meaning of the statute.\n As we have said, we think the record shows, as found by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the oil made and offered for shipment by the Melting Company was a meat-food product, and hence subject to the regulation of the statute requiring inspection before shipment. The decree requiring such oil to be shipped without inspection was properly reversed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOSTAL TELEGRAPH CABLE CO. v. CITY OF NEWPORT, KY.(1918)\nNo. 273\nArgued: Decided: June 10, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 464, 465]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John R. Schindel and Morrison R. Waite, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Brent Spence, of Newport, Ky., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On December 5, 1895, the council of the city of Newport, Kentucky, passed an ordinance purporting to grant to the Postal Telegraph Cable Company and its successors, subject to certain limitations, the right and privilege of erecting poles an stretching wires over the streets and alleys of the city necessary to the establishment, operation, and maintenance of a telegraph system connecting that city with other towns and cities. Among its provisions were these: (a) That unless the company should within thirty days, and in writing, accept the grant subject to the limitations the grant should become void; (b) that nothing in the ordinance should be construed as granting a franchise to the company; and ( c) that the company should pay to the city a 'special license tax' of $100 per annum. This company was a New York corporation having the same name as that of plaintiff in error, and will be referred to hereinafter as the first New York company.\n On or about January 1, 1897, that company conveyed its property in the state of Kentucky, including all its rights and interests in the city of Newport, to another New York corporation known as the Commercial Cable Company; in 1898 this company conveyed the same property and privileges to another New York corporation \n\n[247 U.S. 464, 466]\n\u00a0\n known as the Commercial Cable & Telegraph Company; and on or about December 31, 1900, all of said rights and property were transferred and conveyed by the latter company to the plaintiff in error, the Postal Telegraph Cable Company, which is a corporation of the state of Kentucky, and since then has owned and operated the property.\n In 1908 suit was brought in a state court by the city against plaintiff in error (hereinafter referred to as defendant) to recover 'license taxes' as specified in the ordinance for a series of years, and a judgment in favor of the city for the years 1903 to 1907 inclusive was sustained by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, notwithstanding certain contentions of defendant based upon the provisions of the Constitution of the United States respecting the regulation of commerce among the states and the establishment of post offices and post roads (article 1,  8, pars. 3 and 7), upon the Act of Congress of July 24, 1866 (chapter 230, 14 Stat. 221, Rev. Stat. U. S.  5263 et seq. [Comp. St. 1916,  10072 et seq.]), and upon the 'equal protection' clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 160 Ky. 244, 169 S. W. 700. A writ of error under section 237, Judicial Code (Act of March 3, 1911, ch. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1156 [Comp. St. 1916,  1214]), issued before the taking effect of the Act of September 6, 1916 (chapter 448, 39 Stat. 726), brings the judgment here for review.\n The case was decided upon the pleadings and exhibits, which latter included a copy of the ordinance and what was treated as a transcript of the record of a previous suit brought by the city against the first New York company in a state court of Kentucky to recover license taxes under the ordinance for two years ending December 5, 1898, resulting in a judgment in favor of the city, which was affirmed by the court of appeals, opinion reported in 76 S. W. 159, 25 Ky. Law Rep. 635; the judgment being pleaded as a bar to the defense set up in this action.\n The pleadings in the present suit are so involved and \n\n[247 U.S. 464, 467]\n\u00a0\n prolix that a particular recital of them would be tedious. We will present a sufficient summary to show the questions raised and how they were disposed of.\n The city alleged the passage of the ordinance, and averred that shortly after its passage and in pursuance of it the first New York company erected poles and strung wires in the streets, and established, operated, and maintained a telegraph system in the city, and thereby the ordinance became a binding contract between the city and the company; but that defendant had failed and refused to pay the sum of $100 per annum for the several years in question, in disregard of its contract.\n Defendant's answer alleged that at the time of the enactment of the ordinance defendant was not in existence, and that the Postal Telegraph Cable Company therein referred to was the first New York company; denied that either that company or defendant in any manner or at any time accepted the ordinance, or that the same became a binding c ntract between plaintiff and either company; admitted that shortly after its passage the first New York company began the erection of its poles and wires and the extablishment of its telegraph system, but denied that this was done under or by virtue of the ordinance; alleged on the contrary that that company did not accept but declined to accept the ordinance, as plaintiff well knew, and that the poles were erected and wires strung in and over the streets and alleys of the city by the company under another and independent claim of right, as plaintiff well knew; that that company had accepted the Act of Congress approved July 24, 1866 (chapter 230, 14 Stat. 221, Rev. Stat. U. S.  5263 et seq. [Comp. St. 1916,  10072 et seq.]), and acts amendatory thereof, and had complied with their terms, and thereby obtained the right to construct, maintain, and operate its lines of telegraph over and along all post roads of the United States; that under section 3964, Rev. Stat. U. S. (Comp. St. 1916,  7456), and the Act of Congress of March 1, 1884 (chapter 9, 23 Stat. 3 [Comp. St. 1916,  7457]), all \n\n[247 U.S. 464, 468]\n\u00a0\n the streets and alleys of the city of Newport were such post roads, and by virtue of these provisions of the laws of the United States said New York company was entitled to erect its poles and string its wires over and along the streets and alleys of the city, and did so under that authority and not in pursuance of any acceptance of the ordinance, nor under any contract with the city.\n Partly in an amendment to the answer, and partly in a rejoinder filed at the same time in response to plaintiff's reply, defendant set up the conveyance by said New York company on or about January 1, 1897, of all its property, rights, and lines of telegraph in the state of Kentucky and elsewhere, including its rights over the roads, streets and alleys in said state and in the various cities and municipalities thereof, to the Commercial Cable Company, a corporation of the state of New York; set up the subsequent conveyances of the same property as we have recited them, terminating with the conveyance to the defendant on or about December 31, 1900; alleged that from January 2, 1897, until June 30, 1898, the Commercial Cable Company of New York operated the Kentucky lines in the name of the Postal Telegraph Cable Company of New York; that from June 30, 1898, until December 31, 1900, the Commercial Cable & Telegraph Company of New York did the same; and that since the last mentioned date defendant had owned and operated and still owned and operated said lines, and was entirely separate and distinct from the first New York company and had no relations with it; that since the last mentioned date defendant had been engaged in operating and maintaining a system of telegraphy in the state of Kentucky between cities and towns in that state and, in connection with other companies, between various other cities and towns in other states; that before the last mentioned date defendant had accepted the Act of Congress of July 24, 1866, and had complied with its terms and ever since had been subject \n\n[247 U.S. 464, 469]\n\u00a0\n thereto, and thus had obtained the right to construct, maintain, and operate its lines of telegraph over the streets and alleys of the city of Newport, and was doing so pursuant to this right and not by virtue of any contract with the city.\n Defendant in its answer further set up that the payment of $100 per annum mentioned in the ordinance was not imposed as a rental but as a special license tax; and that it was not a reasonable rental or a reasonable or lawful exaction as a license tax; also that the ordinance was void and inoperative because said right and privilege was not conferred in accordance with section 164 of the Constitution of the commonwealth of Kentucky then in force, and section 3068. Kentucky Statutes; and also that the alleged contract was beyond the powers of the city, ultra vires, and void.\n Defendant further alleged that other telegraph companies and telephone companies were usi g the streets and alleys of the city for poles and wires in a manner substantially similar to their use by the first New York company and by defendant; that none of these companies was subject to the payment of any license tax or was required to pay or agreed to pay any compensation to the city by way of rental, license, or otherwise; that the attempted exaction from defendant of $100 per annum was an unreasonable discrimination between defendant and other telegraph and telephone companies, contrary to the laws of the state of Kentucky and in violation of the Constitution of that state, and also in violation of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and also that it was an unreasonable, excessive, and unlawful exaction in violation of those provisions of the Constitution of the United States conferring upon Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states and to establish post offices and post roads (article 1,  8, pars. 3 and 7), and the laws \n\n[247 U.S. 464, 470]\n\u00a0\n enacted in pursuance thereof, and was therefore null and void.\n In what was entitled a 'second amended petition,' but was ordered by the court to be taken as a reply to defendant's answer, plaintiff set up in substance that in a suit brought by it against the first New York company on September 8, 1899, the city alleged that the ordinance of December 5, 1895, was a contract consented to by that company and under which it derived and enjoyed its privilege to erect poles and string wires in the streets and alleys of the city and establish and maintain a telegraph system therein, that in consideration of this right and privilege the company agreed to pay to the city the sum of $100 per year as specified in the ordinance, and that under its terms $200 was due to the city for two years ending December 5, 1898, for which recovery was prayed; and that in this action a judgment was rendered in the trial court in favor of the city for the amount claimed, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, its opinion being reported in 76 S. W. 159, 25 Ky. Law Rep. 635. The same pleading alleged that the Postal Telegraph Cable Company of Kentucky, defendant in the present action, was the same Postal Telegraph Cable Company that was organized under the laws of the State of New York and was defendant in the former action, or that defendant was the lessee or successor, and succeeded to all the rights, privileges, and duties, of the defendant in the former action, and was using, operating, and controlling the same poles, wires, and equipment as those used, operated, and controlled by the defendant in the former action; and plaintiff pleaded said proceedings and judgment as a bar to the defense set up in the present action.\n By way of rejoinder, defendant denied its identity with the Postal Telegraph Cable Company of New York, defendant in the former action, denied that defendant in \n\n[247 U.S. 464, 471]\n\u00a0\n the present action was the lessee or successor of said company or had succeeded to all its rights, or to any of its rights under the ordinance, and denied that it had succeeded to any of the duties of said New York company. In the same pleading were the averments respecting its acquisition of title to the property, its operation thereof, and its want of relation with the New York company, which we have recited.\n The Court of Appeals, in disposing of the case (160 Ky. 244, 169 S. W. 700), laid aside the questions that were raised under both state and federal law as to the validity and effect of the ordinance, including the authority of the city to grant the privilege or exact the tax, upon the ground that the first New York company had agreed to the ordinance, and it and its successors, including defendant, had since been in possession of the streets under and by virtue of it, and would not be heard to dispute its validity while thus occupying the streets. Referring to the statement in the ordinance that it was not to be construed as granting a franchise, the court said:\n'Doubtle  it was well known that a franchise such as is contemplated and required by the [state] Constitution could not be secured in this way. In accepting the use of the streets under this ordinance, the company merely obtained the right, for the stipulated compensation, to occupy the streets until such time as the city might see proper to revoke the license. But so long as the company occupies the streets under the license it must pay the agreed price. The compensation provided by the ordinance is not a license tax upon the right of the company to do business in the city, but merely a charge against the company for the use of the streets with its poles and wires.'\n\n The contention that the exaction of $100 per annum for the use of the streets was unreasonable was passed by a reference to the previous decision, where it was held (76 S. W. 159, 25 Ky. Law Rep. 637) that the question of the reasonableness of the grant \n\n[247 U.S. 464, 472]\n\u00a0\n and what was a fair compensation for the servitude was a question for the parties to decide. Finally, the contention that the enforcement of the ordinance denied to defendant the equal protection of the laws was rejected upon the ground that it did not appear that any other telegraph company was occupying the streets of Newport under a grant like the one conferred by the ordinance in question; the court declaring that a corporation accepting a privilege under one grant cannot complain that other corporations are occupying the streets under different grants imposing other conditions, and that cities may make reasonable classifications of grants and privileges, and attach dissimilar conditions and impose dissimilar burdens upon each class, without violating the equal protection feature of the federal Constitution.\n It will be observed that every point raised by defendant, whether of fact or of state or federal law, was held immaterial upon the ground that ( a) the first New York company had accepted the grant subject to the payment of the charge of $100 per annum; (b) its liability to pay the same had been adjudicated in the former suit; and (c) defendant, as successor to the rights and privileges of that company, was concluded by the former judgment against it.\n It is true that, in answer to the assertion of a right under the Act of Congress of July 24, 1866, to erect poles and string wires in the streets without the consent of the city, the court declared that the act did not take from the city the right to charge a telegraph company for using its streets a reasonable compensation in the way of a license fee or occupation tax, citing St. Louis v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n148 U.S. 92\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 485, and Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Richmond, \n224 U.S. 160\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 449. In each of these cases, however, it was assumed, in the absence of anything to the contrary, that under the state Constitution and laws the municipality represented the public in the control of \n\n[247 U.S. 464, 473]\n\u00a0\n the streets (\n148 U.S. 100\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 485; \n224 U.S. 171\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 449); in the St. Louis Case it was so held upon rehearing (\n149 U.S. 465\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 990); in both cases it was held that the question of reasonable compensation was a question of fact, to be determined in the usual way (\n148 \nU.S. 104, 105\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 485; \n224 \nU.S. 171, 172\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 449); and in the St. Louis Case, upon a retrial, the ordinance charge was found to be unreasonable in fact (\n166 \nU.S. 388, 391\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 608). But in the present case, both the power of the city under the Constitution and laws of the state, and the reasonableness in fact of the charge of $100 per annum, were denied by defendant, and the court declined to pass upon either question, deeming that defendant was concluded upon both points by the consent of its predecessor.\n We assume that if the first New York company did at the outset accept the ordinance, either in writing according to its terms or by erecting poles and ires and occupying the streets thereunder or in any other manner satisfactory to the city, that company and its successors in the ownership of the telergaph system, including defendant, were bound to comply with the terms of the ordinance as to the 'special license tax' ( which evidently in that case would be regarded as an agreed rental), so long as they continued to retain and enjoy the privileges conferred; that in that event every claim of federal right here asserted would be without foundation; and that, if the fact of acceptance had been conclusively adjudged in a former proceeding against defendant or its privy, the same result would follow.\n But the question arises whether the basis of fact upon which the state court rested its decision denying the asserted federal rights has any support in the record; for, if not, it is our duty to review and correct the error. Southern Pacific Co. v. Schuyler, \n227 \nU.S. 601, 611\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 277, 43 L. R. A. (N. S.) 901; North Carolina R. R. Co. v. Zachary, \n232 \nU.S. 248, 259\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 305, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 159; Carlson v. Curtiss, \n234 \nU.S. 103, 106\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 717; Norfolk & Western Ry. v. \n\n[247 U.S. 464, 474]\n\u00a0\n West Virginia, \n236 \nU.S. 605, 610\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 437; Interstate Amusement Co. v. Albert, \n239 \nU.S. 560, 567\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 168.\n Since the case proceeded to judgment upon the pleadings, it is elementary that every uncontradicted allegation of fact by the unsuccessful party must be taken as true. This applies to the denial by defendant that either it or the first New York company accepted the ordinance, the averment that the latter company declined to accept it and erected its poles and strung its wires in the streets of the city under another and independent claim of right as plaintiff well knew, and other averments bearing upon the question of acceptance in fact.\n There remains only the adjudication in the former suit against the first New York company, which we assume to have been sufficiently pleaded, and to have substantially involved the points that are now material so as to make them res judicata in a subsequent suit between the parties and their privies although based on a different demand (Cromwell v. County of Sac, \n94 U.S. 351\n, 352; Wilson's Executor v. Deen, \n121 \nU.S. 525, 534\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 1004; Nesbitt v. Riverside Independent District, \n144 U.S. 610\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 746), and which the Court of Appeals regarded as concluding defendant upon matters of fact as well as law. But there is nothing in the record to make this judgment conclusive as against defendant except upon the theory of a privity of estate between it and the first New York company. And, as to this, it appears from the averments in defendant's pleadings-indeed, it is stated as a fact in the opinion of the court-that the suit against that company was brought in the year 1899, two years after it had conveyed its property in the state of Kentucky, including all its rights and interests in the city of Newport, to another corporation through which defendant afterwards acquired title.\n The ground upon which, and upon which alone, a judgment against a prior owner is held conclusive against his successor in interest, is that the estoppel runs with the \n\n[247 U.S. 464, 475]\n\u00a0\n property, that the grantor can transfer no better right or title than he himself has, and that the grantee takes cum onere. From this it follows that nothing which the grantor can do or suffer after he has parted with the title can affect rights previously vested in the grantee, for there is no longer privity between them. This doctrine is universally accepted, and was applied by this court in Keokuk & Western Railroad v. Missouri, \n152 \nU.S. 301, 314\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 605; Keokuk Railroad v. Scotland County, \n152 \nU.S. 318, 322\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 605; Dull v. Blackman, \n169 \nU.S. 243, 248\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 333; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Omaha, \n230 U.S. 100\n 122, 33 Sup. Ct. 967. We infer that its obvious application to the facts of this case was inadvertently overlooked by the Court of Appeals, because the general principle is recognized in previous decisions of that court as a limitation upon the doctrine of lis pendens. Clarkson v. Morgan's Devisees, 6 B. Mon. (45 Ky.) 441, 446, 453; Parks v. Smoot, 105 Ky. 63, 67, 48 S. W. 146.\n Res judicata, like other kinds of estoppel, ordinarily is a matter of state law, and as the decision of the state court in this case in effect rests upon that ground, this of itself would be sufficient to sustain the judgment against reversal in this court, except for two queries that must first be answered: (a) Is the question of state law, in this case, independent of the federal questions? And (b) is the decision reached upon that point sufficiently well founded to furnish adequate support for the judgment? Eustis v. Bolles, \n150 \nU.S. 361, 366\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 131; Southern Pacific Co. v. Schuyler, \n227 \nU.S. 601, 610\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 277, 43 L. R. A. (N. S.) 901; Enterprise Irrigation District v. Canal Co., \n243 \nU.S. 157, 164\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 318.\n Waiving the doubt whether, under the particular facts of this case, the question of res judicata can be regarded as independent of the federal questions that were raised, we are of the opinion that the decision reached upon it is so clearly ill founded that it cannot sustain the judgment; \n\n[247 U.S. 464, 476]\n\u00a0\n and this for the reason that it is inconsistent with another federal right of defendant, fundamental in character.\n The doctrine of res judicata rests at bottom upon the ground that the party to be affected, or some other with whom he is in privity, has litigated or had an opportunity to litigate the same matter in a former action in a court of competent jurisdiction. Southern Pacific R. R. v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 1, 48\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 18; Greenl. Ev .  522, 523. The opportunity to be heard is an essential requisite of due process of law in judicial proceedings. Windsor v. McVeigh, \n93 U.S. 274\n, 277; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Schmidt, \n177 \nU.S. 230, 236\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 620; Simon v. Craft, \n182 \nU.S. 427, 436\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 836. And as a state may not, consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, enforce a judgment against a party named in the proceedings without a hearing or an opportunity to be heard (Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n, 733; Scott v. McNeal, \n154 \nU.S. 34, 46\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 1108; Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works, \n237 \nU.S. 413, 423\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 625), so it cannot, without disregarding the requirement of due process, give a conclusive effect to a prior judgment against one who is neither a party nor in privity with a party therein.\n It follows that in this case res judicata cannot be regarded as an adequate support for the judgment; and since, without that, we have not the materials necessary for a proper disposition of the federal questions that were raised, we express no opinion upon them.\n Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPURE OIL CO. v. STATE OF MINNESOTA(1918)\nNo. 74\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 158, 159]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Nathan H. Chase and William A. Lancaster, both of Minneapolis, Minn., and Clifford Thorne, of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff in error.\n Egbert S. Oakley and Lyndon A. Smith, both of St. Paul, Minn., for the State of Minnesota.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case the state of Minnesota sued the plaintiff in error, an extensive dealer in oils, to recover fees, which were charged for the inspection of oils and gasoline, between February 1, 1913, and April 25, 1915. The judgment of the state Supreme Court (134 Minn. 101, 158 N. W. 723) affirming that of the trial court in favor of the state, is before us for review on writ of error. \n\n[248 U.S. 158, 160]\n\u00a0\n The inspection involved was provided for by chapter 502 of the General Laws of the State of Minnesota for the year 1909, the title of which is:\n'An act relating to the inspection of pertroleum products, the appointment of chief inspector of oils and deputy inspectors, manner of inspection, establishing fees for inspection and salaries of inspectors, prohibiting the sale of adulterated oils, and providing penalties for violation thereof'\n\n -and the title of the chapter in which the original act is embodied in the General Statutes of the State is 'Inspection of Oils' (General Statutes of Minnesota 1913, c. 20).\n Section 3622 provides that no person shall sell or offer for sale in the state illuminating oil which has not been inspected as provided for by the act, or which will ignite at a temperature below 120\u00f8 Fahrenheit. A method is prescribed for making this 'fire test' and for determining the gravity of such oils, and the results must be stenciled on each container of oil.\n Section 3625 deals with gasoline, and requires that it shall be subject to the same inspection and control as is prescribed for illuminating oils, 'except that the inspectors are not required to test it other than to ascertain its gravity.'\n All containers of gasoline must be labeled conspicuously with the word 'Gasoline,' the gravity must be stenciled thereon, and it is made unlawful to sell or offer it for sale until inspected and approved. Provision is also made (section 3626) for the inspection of gasoline 'receptacles' to keep them 'free from water and all other foreign substances' and the sale of 'adulterated' gasoline is prohibited (section 3627). Obviously this is, in form, a not unusual type of inspection law.\n The findings of fact by the trial court include the following:\n During the period under discussion the state inspected 9,914 barrels of oil and 81,998 barrels of gasoline owned \n\n[248 U.S. 158, 161]\n\u00a0\n by the plaintiff in error, all of which were brought into Minnesota from other states by common carriers in tank cars, which were held at the place of business of the plaintiff in error until inspected, and all were unloaded from the cars in which they arrived and were held for general sale and distribution. And this in terms:\n'That the testing of gasoline in the manner provided by the statute ... indicates to the public the degree of safety of such gasoline, and has a fair relation to the quality and value thereof. That such inspection protects the community, as applied to sales of gasoline in Minnesota, from frauds and impositions, and advises, informs, and warns the public of the volatile character of said gasoline and the relative degree of care to be exercised in handling, storing, and using the same.'\n\n On the case thus stated it is claimed that the Supreme Court of Minnesota erred in refusing to hold:\n First, that the inspection fees imposed were so excessive in amount as to render the act a revenue rather than an inspection measure and that as such it offends against section 8, article 1, of the federal Constitution, as an attempt by the state to regulate interstate commerce; and\n Second, that to the extent that the act applies to gasoline it is not a valid exercise of the police powers of the state, because it does not serve to protect or safeguard the health, morals or convenience of the public, and therefore offends against the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution, by depriving the plaintiff in error of its property without due process of law to the extent of the fees which it in terms exacts.\n The principles of law applicable to the decision of the case thus before us are few, and they are perfectly settled by the decisions of this court.\n In the exercise of its police power a state may enact inspection laws, which are valid if they tend in a direct and substantial manner to promote the public safety and \n\n[248 U.S. 158, 162]\n\u00a0\n welfare or to protect the public from frauds and imposition when dealing in articles of general use, as to which Congress has not made any conflicting regulation, and a fee reasonably sufficient to pay the cost of such inspection may constitutionally be charged, even though the property may be moving in interstate commerce when inspected.

Ct. 270.\n But, if such inspection charge should be obviously and largely in excess of the cost of inspection, the act will be declared void, because constituting, in its operation, an obstruction to and burden upon that commerce among the states the exclusive regulation of which is committed to Congress by the Constitution. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Taylor, \n192 U.S. 64\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 208; Foote v. Stanley, Comptroller of Maryland, \n232 \nU.S. 494, 504\n, 508 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 377.\n Plainly the application of the principles thus stated leaves open for consideration only the question as to whether the inspection charge is so excessive as to render the act a revenue measure, as the plaintiff in error claims that it is, and not an inspection law enacted in good faith to promote the public safety and prevent fraud and imposition upon the users of oil and gasoline. In the consideration of this question the discretion of the Legislature in determining the amount of the inspection fee will not lightly be disturbed. Its determination is prima facie reasonable, and the courts will not 'enter into any nice \n\n[248 U.S. 158, 163]\n\u00a0\n calculation as to the difference between cost and collection; nor will they declare the fees to be excessive unless it is made clearly to appear that they are obviously and largely beyond what is needed to pay for the inspection services rendered.'

Ct. 204.\n The findings of fact give the following statement of receipts and expenses under the law assailed, from and including the year 1909, in which it was passed, to April 30, 1915, which includes the last day covered by the claim in suit, viz.:\n PERCENTAGE OF RECEIPTS USED FOR DEPARTMENT YEAR. RECEIPTS. EXPENSES. EXPENSES.\n 1909 $24,934 $30,288 87% 1910 50,667 40,044 79% 1911 56,852 40,494 71% 1912 63,354 39,999 63% 1913 72,656 47,117 65% 1914 81,565 52,467 64% July 31, 1914 to Apr. 30, 1915 62,689 46,863 75%\n\n This statement of expenses, however, does not include any charge for offices for the Oil Department, which were in the state capitol, for the services of the state auditor and treasurer in keeping accounts and making collections, for legal counsel, and for services of chemists, or for the Public Examiner's Department, these not being susceptible of exact determination. The reduced percentage of expenses to receipts in several of the years was obviously due to the rapid expansion in the use of gasoline without a corresponding increase in the expenses of administration. This percentage, however, was rising in 1915 and doubtless has increased greatly since, under war conditions. We take judicial notice also of the fact that in 1915 the inspection \n\n[248 U.S. 158, 164]\n\u00a0\n fee on oil and gasoline in tank cars was reduced by the Legislature from 10 to 7 cents and in 1917 from 7 to 5 cents. It was obviously impossible for the state Legislature to determine accurately in advance either what the receipts from or the cost of inspection would be, and having regard to the period of rapid increase in the use of gasoline, through which the country was passing in the years under consideration and to the action of the Legislature in reducing the fee, we cannot consent to impute to that body a purpose other than to conform to the requirements of the Constitution when enacting this legislation.\n The conclusion thus arrived at sustains the validity of the state law as an inspection measure and renders it unnecessary to consider the much argued question as to whether or not the oil and gasoline in question were in interstate transit when inspected. As an inspection law, under the decisions cited, the act is validly applicable, alike whether the property was in intra or in inter state commerce when inspected.\n Neither is it necessary to consider whether the evidence sustains the contention that the inspection of gasoline provided for by the act was of a character such that it did not serve to promote the public safety or to protect the community against fraud and imposition. The finding of fact by the trial court, approved by the Supreme Court of the state, is accepted as conclusive by this court. Northern Pacific Railwy Co. v.

An injunction was granted restraining the collector until further order from delivering the bullion to either of the other defendants.\n Barlow, one of the defendants in the District Court, claims to be the owner of the property by purchase from the defendant Ricaud, who it is claimed purchased it from General Pereyra, who in the year 1913 was the commander of a brigade of the Constitutionalist army of Mexico, of which Venustiano Carranza was then First Chief.\n It is not seriously disputed that General Pereyra, in his capacity as a commanding officer, in September, 1913, demanded this bullion from the Penoles Mining Company, a Mexican corporation doing business at Bermejillo, Mexico; that when it was delivered to him he gave a receipt which contains a promise to pay for it 'on the triumph of the revolution or the establishment of a legal government'; that Pereyra sold the bullion to defendant Ricaud, who sold it to the defendant Barlow; that the proceeds of the sale were devoted to the purchase of arms, ammunition food and clothing for Peryra's troops, and that Pereyra in the transaction represented and acted for the government of General Carranza, which has since been recognized by the United States government as the de jure government of Mexico.\n The plaintiff, appellee here, claims to have purchased the bullion from the Penoles Mining Company in June, 1913\n\n\n The District Court rendered a decree in favor of the plaintiff from which defendants appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and that court certifies three questions as to which it desires the instruction of this court.\n The sufficiency of the certificate of the Circuit Court of Appeals is challenged at the threshold. \n\n[246 U.S. 304, 307]\n\u00a0\n There is no denying that there is much of merit in the objection to the form of this certificate, including the form of the questions, for the reason that the certificate, instead of containing a 'proper statement of the facts on which the questions and propositions of law arise,' as is required by rule 37 of this court (32 Sup. Ct. xiv), contains a statement of what is 'alleged and denied' by the parties plaintiff and defendant in their pleadings, with the additional statement that there was evidence 'tending to establish the facts as claimed by each party,' but without any finding whatever as to what the evidence showed the facts to be, and the first question, on which the other two depend, is in terms based entirely on an 'assumed' statement of facts.\n If this certificate had not been supplemented by the recognition by the United States government of the government of Carranza, first as the de facto and later as the de jure government of Mexico, of which facts this court will take judicial notice (Jones v. United States, \n137 U.S. 202\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 80; Underhill v. Hernandez, \n168 U.S. 250\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 83), it would be our duty to declare the certificate insufficient and to return it to the Circuit Court of Appeals without answering the questions (Cinn., Ham. & Dayton Rd. Co. v. McKeen, \n149 U.S. 259\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 1038; Graver v. Faurot, \n162 U.S. 435\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 799; Cross v. Evans, \n167 U.S. 60\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 733; Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 U.S. 399\n, 422; 34 Sup. Ct. 136).\n But this recognition of the government under which General Pereyra was acting, as the legitimate government of Mexico, makes the answers to the questions so certain and its effect upon the case is so clear, that, for the purpose of making an end of the litigation, we will proceed to answer the questions.\n The first question is:\n I. 'Assuming that the bullion in suit was seized, condemned, and sold for war supplies by the Constitutionalist forces in revolution in Mexico, acting under authority \n\n[246 U.S. 304, 308]\n\u00a0\n from General Carranza, claiming to be the provisional president of the Republic of Mexico, had the District Court of the Western District of Texas, into which the said bullion had been imported from Mexico, jurisdiction to try and adjudge as to the validity of the title acquired by and through the said seizure, appropriation and sale by the Carranza forces as against an American citizen claiming ownership of said bullion prior to its seizure?'\n There can be no doubt that the required diversity of citizenship to give the District Court jurisdiction of the case was stated in the petition for injunction. The certificate shows that it was alleged in the petition that the bullion was the property of the plaintiff and that it had been forcibly taken from its posession in Mexico by unknown persons but without any reference being made to a state of war prevailing therein at the time; that it was consigned to defendant Barlow at El Paso, Texas, and was in a bonded warehouse in the possession of of the defendant Cobb, as collector of customs, who, unless restrained by the court would deliver it to the other defendants.\n This form of petition brought the case within the jurisdiction of the District Court (United States v. Arredondo et al., 6 Pet. 691, 709; Grignon's Lessee v. Astor et al., 2 How. 319; Minnesota Ed. 886), and the question is whether the Ed. 886), and the question in whether the circumstance that the bullion was seized, condemned and sold under the conditions stated in the question, deprived the court of jurisdiction to go forward and adjudge as to the validity of the title acquired by the seizure and sale by the Carranza forces.\n The answer which should be given to this question has been rendered not doubtful by the fact that, as we hav said, the revolution inaugurated by General Carranza against General Huerta proved successful and the government established by him has been recognized by the \n\n[246 U.S. 304, 309]\n\u00a0\n political department of our government as the de facto and later as the de jure government to Mexico, which decision binds the judges as well as all other officers and citizens of the government. United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610; In re Cooper, \n143 U.S. 472\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 453; Jones v. United States, \n137 U.S. 202\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 80. This recognition is retroactive in effect and validates all the actions of the Carranza government from the commencement of its existence ( Williams v. Bruffy, \n96 U.S. 176\n. 186; Underhill v. Hernandez, \n168 \nU.S. 250, 253\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 83), and the action of General Pereyra complained of must therefore be regarded as the action, in time of civil war, of a duly commissioned general of the legitimate government of Mexico.\n It is settled that the courts will take judicial notice of such recognition, as we have here, of the Carranza government by the political department of our government (Jones v. United States, \n137 U.S. 202\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 80), and that the courts of one independent government will not sit in judgment on the validity of the acts of another done within its own territory (Underhill v. Hernandez, \n168 \nU.S. 250, 253\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 83; American Banana Company v. United Fruit Company, \n213 U.S. 347\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047; Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., \n246 U.S. 297\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 309, 62 L. Ed . --). This last rule, however, does not deprive the courts of jurisdiction once acquired over a case. It requires only that when it is made to appear that the foreign government has acted in a given way on the subject-matter of the litigation, the details of such action or the merit of the result cannot be questioned but must be accepted by our courts as a rule for their decision. To accept a ruling authority and to decide accordingly is not a surrender or abandonment of jurisdiction but is an exercise of it. It results that the title to the property in this case must be determind by the result of the action taken by the military authorities of Mexico and that, giving effect to this rule is an exercise of jurisdiction which requires that the first question be answered in the affirmative- \n\n[246 U.S. 304, 310]\n\u00a0\n The second question reads:\n'If the first question is answered in the affirmative, does the subsequent recognition by the United States government of Carranza as the legitimate president of the Republic of Mexico and his government as the only legitimate government of the Republic of Mexico deprive this court of jurisdiction on this appeal to decide and adjudge the case on its merits?'\n\n Our answer to the first requires a negative answer to this second question.\n The third question reads:\n'If question 2 is answered in the negative, did the seizure, condemnation, and sale of the bullion in the manner and for the purposes stated to be assumed in question 1 have the effect of divesting the title to or ownership of it of a certain citizen of the United States of American not in or a resident of Mexico when such seizure and condemnation occurred?'\n\n The answer to this question must be in the affirmative, for the reasons given and upon the authorities cited in the opinion recently announced in cases Nos. 268 and 269, Oetjen v. Central Leather Company. The fact that the title to the property in controversy may have been in an American citizen, who was not in or a resident of Mexico at the time it was seized for military purposes by the legitimate government of Mexico, does not affect the rule of law that the act within its own boundaries of one sovereign state cannot become the subject of re-examination and modification in the courts of another. Such action when shown to have been taken, becomes, as we have said, a rule of decision for the courts of this country. Whatever rights such n American citizen may have can be asserted only through the courts of Mexico or through the political departments of our government. The first and third questions will be answered in the affirmative and the second in the negative.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROCK SPRING DISTILLING CO. v. W A GAINES & CO.(1918)\nNo. 58\nArgued: Decided: March 18, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 312, 313]\n\u00a0\n This is a bill in equity brought by the Gaines Company against the Rock Spring Company to restrain the latter from using the trade-mark of the former. The trademark is registered and is employed by the Gaines Company to designate a brand of straight rye or straight bourbon whisky manufactured by that company.\n The following are the facts of the bill stated narratively:\n The Gaines Company is the owner of a whisky distillery in Woodford county, Kentucky, known and named as the Old Crow Distillery. It is the only one in the state that is or ever has been designated by the name of 'Crow' or 'Old Crow.'\n Its product has been at all of the times mentioned in \n\n[246 U.S. 312, 314]\n\u00a0\n the bill straight rye and straight bourbon whisky and to it there has at all times been applied the trade-mark consisting of the words 'Old Crow' by being imprinted or branded on the wooden box containing the whisky and imprinted upon labels affixed to bottles containing the whisky. The trademark is now and for many years past has been used by the company and its predecessors in commerce among the states.\n On February 26, 1909, it filed in the Patent Office, in pursuance of the Act of February 20, 1905 (33 Stat. 724 [Comp. St. 1916,  9485 et seq .]), in due form and under the conditions required, an application for registration of the trade-mark and a certificate of registration for the same was duly issued and for many years past has been used by the company as a trade-mark for its straight rye and straight bourbon whisky.\n The Gaines Company, availing itself of certain acts of Congress, began and has ever since maintained the bottling of the 'Old Crow' in bond and it was then and has ever since remained the only 'Old Crow' whisky bottled in bond and has an extensive sale throughout the United States and in foreign countries; and when so bottled in bond it is known as and called 'Old Crow Bottled in Bond,' is so marked, and commands a hish price.\n The Rock Spring Company is a corporation, has a distillery in the county of Daviess, Kentucky, and is the owner of a distillery situated therein known as Distillery No. 18, operated by Silas Rosenfield, one of the defendants.\n The Rock Spring Company, in fraud of the Gaines Company's rights and in infringement of its trade-mark, made or caused to be made and sold or caused to be sold in Kentucky a certain spurious straight bourbon whisky, not the product of the Gaines Company, and branded the same with the words 'Celebrated Old Crow \n\n[246 U.S. 312, 315]\n\u00a0\n Whisky Bottled in Bond,' have caused the same to be bottled in bond, have applied to the labels thereon the words 'Old Crow' in script type, and have caused the same to be sold and transported in interstate commerce, and this with the intent to mislead and deceive the public, and are doing so and will continue to do so unless restrained.\n An injunction is prayed and an accounting.\n Demurrers were filed by the Rock Spring Company and Rosenfield, which were overruled, and they then answered, pleading a prior adjudication based upon the following alleged facts: A suit was brought in the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern Division of the Eastern District of Missouri by W. A. Gaines & Company against Abraham M. Hellman and Moritz Hellman charging infringement of the trade-mark and unfair competition. The bill was subsequently amended making Max Kahn, administrator with will annexed of the estate of Abraham M. Hellman, deceased, a party to the suit. Upon the issues framed a decree was entered in favor of the complainants, an injunction granted and an accounting ordered.\n The decree was reversed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit with directions to dismiss the bill on the ground that the evidence clearly showed that the predecessors in business of the appellants therein had adopted the words 'Old Crow' as a trade-mark for whisky as early as the year 1863 and the evidence failed to show that the predecessors of the Gaines Company had used the words as a trade-mark prior to the year 1870\n\n\n A petition for certiorari to review the decision was denied by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n Other proceedings were had in the suit pending its appeal and afterward. The suit, however, was finally dismissed on the merits because of the decision of the \n\n[246 U.S. 312, 316]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals and the action of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n Defendants are in privity with the parties recovering under those decisions and decrees and are manufacturing whisky under contracts of agency from them or their successors and neither have nor claim any right except through such contract.\n The Hellman Distilling Company filed a petition to be permitted to intervene, which was denied. (C. C.) 179 Fed. 544.\n After hearing, a decree was entered sustaining the plea of former adjudication based on the decree of the District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and accordingly and for that reason the bill of complaint, so far as it sought relief for any infringement of the trade- mark 'Old Crow' in connection with its use on whisky was dismissed. And it was further decreed that the registration of the trade-mark July 20, 1909, could not and did not invalidate or nullify the estoppel.\n The decree was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and thereupon this certiorari was applied for and allowed.\n Messrs. Luther Ely Smith, of St. Louis, Mo., and William T. Ellis, of Owensboro, Ky., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Edmund F. Trabue, of Louisville, Ky., James L. Hopkins, of St. Louis, Mo., and Daniel W. Lindsey, of Frankfort, Ky., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The decree of the District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, directed by the decision of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, \n\n[246 U.S. 312, 317]\n\u00a0\n is pleaded in bar, and whether it is such depends upon the issues that were made or passed upon in those courts.\n The bill of complaint in the case alleged that in 1835 one James Crow ( he is the James Crow of this suit) invented and formulated a novel process for the production of whisky which he did not patent or seek to patent but kept for his own use until his death in 1855.\n During all of the time after 1835 the whisky so produced was known and styled as 'Old Crow' whisky and the designation was adopted and used as a trade-mark.\n After the death of Crow one William F. Mitchell, to whom Crow had communicated his secret process, continued the distillation so designated and in 1867 a partnership, styled Gaines, Berry & Co., obtained possession of the distillery wherein the whisky distilled by the indicated process continued to be produced by the same process until the partnership was succeeded by W. A. Gaines & Co., and the latter company succeeded also to all of the partnership assets of the other and continued to produce the whisky until the incorporation of the complainant, when all these assets were acquired by it.\n When the name 'Old Crow' was applied by Crow it was a valid trade- mark and since its adoption it has always been applied to the whisky produced by the indicated secret process, and since that time has indicated to the public whisky distilled on Glenn's creek, in Woodford county, Kentucky, and nowhere else.\n Complainant caused the same to be registered in the Patent Office under the provisions of the act of Congress so providing. The value of the trade-mark is $500,000 and an integral part of the good will of complainant's business and the whisky is of greater value than any other of equal age.\n Since January, 1903, the defendants, in violation of complainant's rights and good will, have made or caused \n\n[246 U.S. 312, 318]\n\u00a0\n to be made and sold in the city of St. Louis a certain spirituous or alcoholic fluid not made under complainant's process and have labeled it with the words 'Old Crow' without license from the complainant and against its consent. Such unlawful u e will greatly lessen the value of complainant's business and good will, and complainant is without adequate remedy at law.\n There was the usual prayer for an accounting and an injunction.\n There was a supplemental bill to the same effect, but charging that A. M. Hellman & Co. had become the successors of the original defendants and had continued the acts alleged in the original bill.\n To the bill the defendants answered, with denials, and alleged the use of the word 'Crow', 'Old Crow' and 'J. W. Crow' in connection with their own business upon packages of whisky and in their and their predecessor's business from 1863 and prior thereto; that the whisky sold by complainant was an unrefined, harmful and deleterious article and that the whisky sold by them was a brand largely free from impurities.\n The defendants also filed a cross-bill which, however, was not insisted upon.\n These, then, were the issues, and upon them and the evidence adduced to sustain them the Circuit Court entered a decree establishing complainant's right to the word 'Old Crow' as a trade-mark, enjoined the use thereof by defendants and found them guilty of unfair competition in business and ordered an accounting. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree.\n The latter court made a careful review of the evidence, denominating it a mass of the relevant and irrelevant, and felt that it was not necessary to consider the comparative excellence of the whiskies, and remarked that the evidence did 'not show that Glenn's creek in any way entered into the composition of the whisky' and that \n\n[246 U.S. 312, 319]\n\u00a0\n 'there was no secret about the process employed by Crow nor did it differ materially from that employed by every other distiller of the same period.' To the objection that the 'designative words' were rarely used by the Hellmans and that their product was of inferior quality, the court replied that the right to use could not be measured by the extent to which the Hellmans employed it, 'whether more or less frequently,' nor 'by the overshadowing comparative amount of the complainant's [Gaines & Co.'s] sales under the designation 'Old Crow' whisky, nor by asserted superiority of its product.'\n The court concluded as follows:\n'(1) That inasmuch as the defendants' predecessors in business prior to the use or the adoption of the designative word 'Crow' or the words 'Old Crow' as a trade-mark, employed those words in descriptive terms in connection with their business as dealers in whisky in St. Louis, Mo., and said predecessors and the defendants so continued to use the same, to a limited extent, up to the time of the institution of this suit, in good faith, they are not guilty of infringing the complainant's claimed trade-mark; and (2) that the defendants are not guilty of having engaged in unfair competition with the complainant in the prosecution of their business.'\n\n It will be observed that the issues in that case were the same as those in the present case as to the right to the use of the word 'Crow' with any of its qualifications. But in this case there is another ground of recovery alleged; that is, the application for and the receipt of the certificate of registration for the word as a trade-mark for straight rye and straight bourbon whisky. The District Court, however, adjudged that the decree of the Circuit Court in Missouri and its affirmance by the Circuit Court of Appeals constituted a bar to this suit. To the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the \n\n[246 U.S. 312, 320]\n\u00a0\n Sixth Circuit, reversing the action of the District Court, this certiorari is directed.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, however, did not yield to all of the views of the Gaines Company. It refused to decide, as urged to do, that the defendants in this suit were not in privity with the defendants in the other and it rejected the contention that the use of the trade-mark established in the Hellman Company for a blended whisky was not an adjudication of the right to use it upon a straight whisky. In the rulings on both contentions we concur. Th first needs no comment; we adopt that of the court on the second. The court said that:\n'Whatever the extended classifications and subclassifications of the Patent Office practice may contemplate, neither the common law nor the registration statute can intend such confusion as must result from recognizing the same trade-mark as belonging to different people for different kinds of the same article. Established trade-marks directly indicate origin; but if they have any value, it is because they indirectly indicate kind and quality; and to say that the seller of a blended whisky might properly put upon it a mark which was known to stand for a straight whisky, or vice versa, would be to say that he might deceive the public not only as to the origin, but also as to the nature and quality, of the article.'\n\n The philosophy of this might be questioned. But it seems to have become established, and, however it may be disputed in reason, there is an opposing consideration. As said by Circuit Judge Sanborn in Layton Pure Food Co. v. Church & Dwight Co. (C. C. A.) 182 Fed. 35, 39, 104 C. C. A. 475, 479 (32 L. R. A. [N. S.] 274):\n'Uniformity and certainty in rules of property are often more important and desirable than technical correctness.'\n\n And this reasoning prevailed with the Circuit Court of Appeals which, after citing cases, said that it was forced to think 'that whatever was adjudicated regarding \n\n[246 U.S. 312, 321]\n\u00a0\n complainant's title to the trade-mark applies to its use of both kinds of whisky.' And, of course, conversely we may say that whatever was decided against its title to its trademark applies to its use on both kinds of whisky. In other words, if defendants were adjudged to have title to the words 'Crow' or 'Old Crow' on blended whisky, they have a right to use it on straight whisky without infringing any right of complainant. We came back, therefore, to the question as to what was adjudged in the prior suit.\n To this question the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit gave great care and in an opinion of strength decided the negative of it. The court, in concession to the argument, assigned a prior use to the Hellmans, but expressed the view that the existence of such 'general or prima facie exclusive right is not inconsistent with an inability to enforce it against some persons and under some circumstances.' And it was added:\n'Instances may arise where the affirmative conduct or the laches of the first appropriator, and with reference to what he was at first entitled to call an infringement, has been such that on the principles of estoppel or the rule of laches a court of equity cannot tolerate that he should enforce against the later user the right which might have been originally perfect. ... Under these considerations and upon reference to the pleadings and the proofs in the Hellman Case, we conclude that the latter case is of the class where the refusal to give an injunction to the first appropriator of the mark may be justified upon the ground of his laches or estoppel; and so this ground of support must be considered in determining what is the true basis of that decree.'\n\n The court hence concluded that it, the decree, did not adjudge title to the Hellmans but adjudged them a 'defensive right and nothing more,' and, explaining the right, the court said that it 'does not extend to any whisky \n\n[246 U.S. 312, 322]\n\u00a0\n not mixed or blended so as to be of the same general type as that to which defendants [Hellmans] had been making or to trade or territory in which they were not selling when the bill was filed.'\n We are not able to assent. The court admitted that the language in the body of the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is consistent with the interpretation petitioners put upon it, that is, 'that the trade-mark, in its general, prima facie, affirmative aspect, belonged to the Hellman's prior appropriation'; but the court added that the last paragraph of the opinion indicated 'that the two judges (only two sitting) did not unite in pu ting the decision on that ground.' We think this was an oversight. The opinion was that of the court, though delivered by one judge, and the conclusion was the conclusion of the court, and necessarily had to be, else there would have been no decision or decree. And it was thoroughgoing. It is manifest from the excerpts we have made from the opinion that the judgment of the court was not limited as to time or territory; nor did the pleadings so limit it. The complainant in that case (respondent here) alleged that it was the sole and exclusive owner of the trade-mark and had used it from 1835 to the present time, being virtually the successor of the first producer of the product.\n Defendants (petitioners) contested the claim and asserted a right in themselves based on prior adoption and continuous use, and that right was adjudged to them.\n Decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROSEN v. U S(1918)\nNo. 365\nArgued: December 12, 1917Decided: January 7, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 467, 468]\n\u00a0\n\n No. 438\n:Mr. Terence J. McManus, of New York City, for petitioner Pakas.\n No. 365:Mr. Assistant Attorney General Fitts, for the United States.\n Mr. Meier Steinbrink, of Brooklyn, N. Y., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases present precisely the same questions for decision. They were argued and will be decided together.\n In No. 365 Rosen and Wagner were indicted in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of New York with one Broder for conspiring to buy and receive certain checks and letters which had been stolen from 'duly authorized depositories of United States mail matter,' and which were known to the accused to have been so stolen. Broder pleaded guilty, and when he was afterwards called as a witness for the \n\n[245 U.S. 467, 469]\n\u00a0\n government the objection was made that he was not competent to testify for the reason that, as was admitted by the government, he had theretofore pleaded guilty to the crime of forgery in the second degree, in the Court of General Sessions, in the county and state of New York, had been sentenced to imprisonment, and had served his sentence. The objection was overruled and Broder was permitted to testify. This ruling was assigned as error in the Circuit Court of Appeals, where it was affirmed, and it is now assigned as error in this court.\n The second claim of error is that the trial court erred in refusing the motion of the defendants to direct a verdict of acquittal on the ground that no crime had been committed, for the reason that the box from which the mail was taken was not 'an authorized depository of the mail,' and that it was taken therefrom after it had left the possession of the government.\n Broder testified, and it was not disputed, that the letters were stolen from boxes placed by tenants for the receipt of mail in the halls of buildings in which they had their places of business. The boxes bore the names of the owners and were not locked, and while mail was deposited in them by the carriers no mail was collected from them.\n In No. 438 Pakas and Broder, the same Broder as in No. 365, were jointly indicted for buying and receiving three designated checks, knowing the same to have been stolen from letters which had been deposited in the United States mail for delivery by the post office establishment of the United States. The same questions are presented, raised in the same manner, as in No. 365.\n For the validity of the claim that Broder was disqualified as a witness by his sentence for the crime of forgery, the plaintiffs in error rely upon United States v. Reid et al., 12 How. 361, decided in 1851. In that case it was \n\n[245 U.S. 467, 470]\n\u00a0\n held that the competency of witnesses in criminal trials in United States courts must be determined by the rules of evidence which were in force in the respective states when the Judiciary Act of 1789 was passed, and the argument in this case is, that by the common law as it was administered in New York in 1789 a person found guilty of forgery and sentenced, was thereby rendered incompetent as a witness until pardoned, and that, therefore, the objection to Broder should have been sustained.\n While the decision in United States v. Reid, supra, has not been specifically overruled, its authority must be regarded as seriously shaken by the decisions in Logan v. United States, \n144 U.S. 263\n-301, 12 Sup. Ct. 617, and in Benson v. United States, \n146 U.S. 325\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 60.\n The Benson Case differed from the Reid Case only in that in the former the witness whose competency was objected to was called by the government while in the latter he was called by the defendant. The testimony of the witness was admitted in the one case but it was rejected in the other, and both judgments were affirmed by this court-however forty years had intervened between the two trials. In the Benson Case, decided in 1891, this court, after determining that the Reid Case was not decisive of it, proceeded to examine the question then before it 'in the light of general authority and of sound reason,' and after pointing out the great change in the preceding fifty years in the disposition of courts to hear witnesses rather than to exclude them, a change 'which was wrought partially by legislation and partially by judicial construction,' and how 'the merely technical barriers which excluded witnesses from the stand had been removed,' proceeded to dispose of the case quite without reference to the common-law practice, which it was claimed should rule it.\n Accepting as we do the authority of the later, the Benson Case, rather than that of the earlier decision, we* \n\n[245 U.S. 467, 471]\n\u00a0\n shall dispose of the first question in this case, 'in the light of general authority and of sound reason.'\n In the almost twenty years which have elapsed since the decision of the Benson Case, the disposition of courts and of legislative bodies to remove disabilities from witnesses has continued, as that decision shows it had been going forward before, under dominance of the conviction of our time that the truth is more likely to be arrived at by hearing the testimony of all persons of competent understanding who may seem to have knowledge of the facts involved in a case, leaving the credit and weight of such testimony to be determined by the jury or by the court, rather than by rejecting witnesses as incompetent, with the result that this principle has come to be widely, almost universally, accepted in this country and in Great Britain.\n Since the decision in the Benson Case we have significant evidence of the trend of congressional opinion upon this subject in the removal of the disability of witnesses convicted of perjury, R. S. 5392 (Comp. St. 1916,  10295), by the enactment of the federal Criminal Code in 1909 with this provision omitted and section 5392 repealed. This is significant, because the disability to testify, of persons convicted of perjury, survived in some jurisdictions much longer than many of the other common-law disabilities, for the teason that the offense concerns directly the giving of testimony in a court of justice, and conviction of it was accepted as showing a greater disregard for the truth than it was thought should be implied from a conviction of other crime.\n Satisfied as we are that the legislation and the very great weight of judicial authority which have developed in support of this modern rule, especially as applied to the competency of witnesses convicted of crime, proceed upon sound principle, we conclude that the dead hand of the common- law rule of 1789 should no longer be applied to such cases as we have here, and that the ruling \n\n[245 U.S. 467, 472]\n\u00a0\n of the lower courts on this first claim of error should be approved.\n There remains the claim that the boxes from which the letters were stolen were not 'authorized depositories of mail matter,' and that, therefore, the stealing of the letters from them did not violate section 194 of the federal Criminal Code, of March 4, 1909 (Comp. St. 1916,  10364), under which petitioners were indicted.\n Section 194 provides that:\n'Whoever shall steal, take, or abstract ... from ... any ... authorized depository for mail matter ... any letter ... or shall abstract or remove from any such letter ... any article,' etc., shall be fined, etc.\n\n Section 161 of the Revised Statutes of the United States Provides:\n'The head of each Department is authorized to prescribe regulations, not inconsistent with law, for the government of his Department, the conduct of his officers and clerks, the distribution and performance of its business, and the custody, use, and preservation ... of the ... property appertaining thereto.' Comp. St. 1916,  235.\n\n A regulation promulgated as an order of the Post Office Department prior to the dates on which the defendants are charged with having committed the crime for which they were indicted was introduced in evidence and reads as follows:\n'Any letter box or other receptacle intended or used for the receipt or delivery of mail matter on any city delivery route ... or other mail route ... is hereby designated a letter box for the receipt or delivery of mail matter, within the meaning of the Act of March 4, 1909.'\n\n This regulation was obviously intended to supplement section 194 of the Criminal Code, under which the defendants were indicted, by supplying the detail which Congress contemplated should be so supplied when it left undefined \n\n[245 U.S. 467, 473]\n\u00a0\n 'or other authorized depository of mail matter.' Such a regulation if fairly within the scope of the authority given by Congress to make it, has the force and effect of law, and violations of it are punishable under the act which it supplements.\n That section 194 contemplates that its general language shall be made definite by such order is plain, and that the order is well within the authority conferred upon the Postmaster General by R. S.  161, cannot be doubted, prescribing, as it does, a rule for the conduct of carriers in the discharge of their duties in the delivery of mail and for safely preserving the property committed to the care of the Department until it shall reach the persons to whom it is addressed. This satisfies the law. Searight v. Stokes, 3 How. 151-169; Ex Parte Reed, \n100 U.S. 13\n, 22; United States v. Grimaud, \n220 U.S. 506\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 480; Light v. United States, \n220 U.S. 523\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 485; Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 U.S. 389\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 387.\n The suggestion that when the mail was deposited in a privately owned box it passed out of the custody of the government and beyond the protection of the law does not deserve extended notice. The letters which were stolen did not reach the manual possession of the persons to whom they were addressed, but were taken from an authorized depository over which the Act of Congress, by its express terms, extended its protection until its function had been served.\n It results that the judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissent from so much of the opinion as departs from the rule settled in United States v. Reid and Logan v. United States, which they think is in no way modified by what actually was decided in Benson v. United States. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRUDDY v. ROSSI(1918)\nNo. 17\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles E. Miller and Carlton Fox, both of Wallace, Idaho, for plaintiff in error. \n\n[248 U.S. 104, 105]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By 'An act to secure homesteads to actual settlers on the public domain,' approved May 20, 1862 (12 Stat. c. 75, p. 392), Congress prescribed the conditions under which citizens could acquire unappropriated public lands in tracts of not exceeding 160 acres. A manifest purpose was to induce settlement upon and cultivation of these lands by those who, five years after proper entry, would become owners in fee through issuance of patents. The great end in view was to convert waste places into permanent homes. Such occupancy and use constituted a most important consideration and were rightly expected to yield larger public benefits than the small required payment of one dollar and a quarter per acre.\n Decision of this cause requires us to consider the meaning and validity of section 4 of the Act (R. S.  2296 [Comp. St. 1916,  4551]), which provides:\n'No lands acquired under the provisions of this Act shall in any event become liable to the satisfaction of any debt or debts contracted prior to the issuing of the patent therefor.'\n\n Plaintiff in error made preliminary homestead entry of designated land within the state of Idaho August 6, 1903; submitted final proofs October 4, 1909; obtained \n\n[248 U.S. 104, 106]\n\u00a0\n final receipt and certificate November 12, 1909; final patent issued August 26, 1912. In 1914 two judgments were obtained against him; the first upon indebtedness incurred prior to November 12, 1909; the second upon debts contracted subsequent to that date and prior to patent. Executions were issued and levied upon the homestead; and thereupon the original proceeding was begun to declare asserted liens invalid and a cloud upon the title. The court below held the first judgment unenforceable against the land since it represented indebtedness which accrued prior to final entry. It further held the second judgment could be so enforced as it was based upon debts contracted after final entry, at which time the homesteader became legally entitled to his patent. 28 Idaho, 376, 154 Pac. 977.\n The language of section 4 is clear and we find no adequate reason for thinking that it fails precisely to express the lawmaker's intention.\n Did Congress have power to restrict alienation of homestead lands after conveyance by the United States in fee simple? This question undoubtedly presents difficulties which we are not disposed to minimize. In Wright v. Morgan, \n191 \nU.S. 55, 58\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 6, a similar point was suggested but not decided.\n The Constitution (article 4,  3, cl. 2) declares:\n'The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.'\n\n And it is settled that Congress has plenary power to dispose of public lands. United States v. Gratiot et al., 14 Pet. 526, 537 (10 L. Ed. 573). They may be leased, sold or given away upon such terms and conditions as the public interests require. Instead of granting fee simple titles with exemption from certain debts, long leases might have been made or conditional titles bestowed in such fashion as practically to protect homesteads from all indebtedness. \n\n[248 U.S. 104, 107]\n\u00a0\n 'The sound construction of the Constitution must allow to the national Legislature that discretion, with respect to the means by which the powers it confers are to be carried into execution, which will enable that body to perform the high duties assigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people. Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are consitutional.' McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (4 L. Ed. 579).\n Acting within its discretion, Congress determined that in order promptly to dispose of public lands and bring about their permanent occupation and development it was proper to create the designated exemption; and we are unable to say that the conclusion was ill-founded or that the means were either prohibited or not appropriate to the adequate performance of the high duties which the Legislature owed to the public.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES (dissenting).\n This case involves a question of theory that may be important and I think it desirable to state the considerations that make me doubt. The facts needing to be mentioned are few. On August 26, 1912, the United States conveyed land in Idaho to Ruddy in fee simple, in pursuance of a homestead entry by Ruddy on August 6, 1903, final proof on October 4, 1909, and final receipt of the purchase price on November 12, 1909. In September 1912, after the conveyance, Rossi began suits against Ruddy, attaching this land, and in June, 1914, levied executions upon the same. The debts for which the \n\n[248 U.S. 104, 108]\n\u00a0\n suits were brought were incurred before the issue of the patent and the present proceeding is to prevent Rossi from selling the land to satisfy the judgments. The question arises under Rev. St.  2296 (Comp. St. 1916,  4551), providing that no lands acquired under that chapter shall in any event become liab le to the satisfaction shall in any event become liable to the satisfaction issuing of the patent therefor. The Supreme Court of Idaho narrowed the issue to the case of debts contracted after final proof, but that distinction is not important to the difficulty in my mind.\n My question is this: When land has left the ownership and control of the United States and is part of the territory of a State not different from any other privately owned land within the jurisdiction and no more subject to legislation on the part of the United States than any other land, on what ground is a previous law of Congress supposed any longer to affect it in a way that a subsequent one could not? This land was levied upon not on the assertion that any lien upon it was acquired before the title passed from the United States, but merely as any other land might be attached for a debt that Rossi had a right to collect, after the United States had left the premises. I ask myself what the United States has to do with that. There is no condition, no reserved right of reentry, no reversion in the United States, saved either under the Idaho law as any private grantor might save it, or by virtue of antecedent title. All interest of the United States as owner is at an end. It is a stranger to the title. Even in case of an escheat the land would not go to it, but would go to the State. Therefore the statute must operate, if at all, purely by way of legislation, not as a qualification of the grant. If section 2296 is construed to apply to this case, there is simply the naked assumption of one sovereignty to impose its will after whatever jurisdiction or authority it had has ceased and the land has come fully under the jurisdiction of what for this purpose \n\n[248 U.S. 104, 109]\n\u00a0\n is a different power. It is a pure attempt to regulate the alienability of land in Idaho by law, without regard to the will of Idaho, which we must assume on this record to authorize the levy if it is not prevented by an act of Congress occupying a paramount place.\n I believe that this Court never has gone farther in the way of sustaining legislation concerning land within a State than to uphold a law forbidding the enclosure of public lands, which little, if at all, exceeded the rights of a private owner, although it was construed to prevent the erection of fences upon the defendants' own property manifestly for the sole purpose of enclosing land of the United States. Camfield v. United States, \n167 U.S. 518\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 864. At most it was a protection of the present interests of the United States under a title paramount to the State. On the other hand, it is said in Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 224, that no power in the nature of municipal sovereignty can be exercised by the United States within a State; that such a power is repugnant to the Constitution. This case was referred to in Withers v. Buckley, 20 How. 84, and it was decided that the act of Congress authorizing the formation of the State of Mississippi and providing that the Mississippi River should be forever free 'could have no effect to restrict the new State in any of its attributes as an independent sovereign government,' and both these cases were cited upon this point with approval in Ward v. Race Horse, \n163 \nU.S. 504, 511\n, 512 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 1076. See also Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 \nU.S. 1, 27\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 548. In Irvine v. Marshall, 20 How. 558, where it was held that the laws of a territory abolishing constructive trusts were ineffectual to protect the holder of a certificate from the United States against the establishment of such a trust, it was said that 'when the subject, and all control over it, shall have passed from the United States, and have become vested in a citizen or resident of the territory, then indeed the territorial regulations may operate upon it,' and \n\n[248 U.S. 104, 110]\n\u00a0\n later in the decision there is cited a passage from Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 517, to the same effect-a passage also cited and relied upon by the four justices who dissented and held that the territorial laws governed even them. It has been repeated ever since. McCune v. Essig, \n199 \nU.S. 382, 390\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 78; Buchser v. Buchser, \n231 \nU.S. 157, 161\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 46.\n Coming to the precise issue, the question of the power of the United States to restrict alienation of land within a State after it had conveyed the land in fee was left open in Wright v. Morgan, \n191 \nU.S. 55, 58\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 6, but it was said that the clearest expression would be necessary before it would be admitted that such a restriction was imposed. In Buchser v. Buchser, \n231 U.S. 157\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 46, it was held that the laws of the United States did not prevent homestead land becoming community property at the moment that title was acquired, and it was said that, the acquisition under the United States law being complete, that law had released its control. The statement in Wilcox v. Jackson, supra, that when the title has passed the land 'like all other property in the State is subject to state legislation' was repeated. In Alabama v. Schmidt, \n232 U.S. 168\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 301, following Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, it was held that land conveyed to the State by the United States for the use of schools could be acquired by adverse possession under state law, and that the trust, although as was said in the earlier case 'a sacred obligation imposed on its public faith' imposed only an honorary obligation on the State. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Townsend, \n190 U.S. 267\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 671, was distinguished as having been decided on the ground that in the grant to the Railway there was an implied condition of reverter in case the company ceased to hold the land for the purpose for which it was granted, a ground, which, as I have said, is absent here.\n It is said that where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave constitutional \n\n[248 U.S. 104, 111]\n\u00a0\n questions arise and by the other of which they are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 408\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 527. I am aware that this principle like some others more often is invoked in aid of a conclusion reached on other grounds than made itself the basis of decision, but it seems to me that it properly should govern here. It might without violence. When the Act of 1862, now Rev. St.  2296, was passed the United States owned territories to which it could be applied with full scope. Irvine v. Marshall, 20 How. 558. The greater part of the public land was in those territories. Without stopping to suggest other possibilities of construction this fact is enough to explain and give validity to the Act when passed. There is no need to import to it the intent to anticipate the future and to reach the States that were still in the bosom of time.\n Of course the United States has power to choose appropriate means for exercising the authority given to it by the Constitution. But I see no sufficient ground for extending that authority to a case like this. It is not the business of the United States to determine the policy to be pursued concerning privately owned land within a State. According to all cases in this Court, so far as I know, when the patent issued its authority was at an end.\n I am aware that my doubts are contrary to manifest destiny and to a number of decisions in the State Courts. I know also that when common understanding and practice have established a way it is a waste of time to wander in bypaths of logic. But as I have a real difficulty in understanding how the Congressional restriction is held to govern this case-a question which nothing that I have heard as yet appears to me to answer-I think it worth while to mention my misgivings, if only to show that they have been considered and are not shared. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRUTHENBERG v. U S(1918)\nNo. 656\nArgued: Decided: January 14, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 480, 481]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph W. Sharts, of Dayton, Ohio, for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Schue was indicted for having failed to register as required by the Act of Congress of May 18, 1917 (Public Act No. 12, 65th Congress, c. 15, 40 Stat. 76), known as the Selective Draft Law, and in the same indictment it was charged that Ruthenberg, Wagenknecht and Baker, the plaintiffs in error 'did aid, abet, counsel, command and induce' Schue in failing to register 'and procure him to commit the offense involved in his so doing.' Schue pleaded guilty and the other three defendants were tried, found guilty and sentenced. Because of objections raised to the constitutionality of the act this direct writ of error was prosecuted.\n As every contention made in this case concerning the unconstitutionality of the Selective Draft Law was urged in Arver v. United States, \n245 U.S. 366\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 159, 62 L. Ed. --, and held to be without merit, that subject may be put out of view. The remaining assignments of error are to say the least highly technical and require only the briefest notice.\n The want of merit in the proposition that constitutional \n\n[245 U.S. 480, 482]\n\u00a0\n or statutory rights were denied the plaintiffs in error, who were Socialists, because the grand and trial juries were composed exclusively of members of other political parties and of property owners, is demonstrated by previous adverse rulings upon similar contentions urged by negro defendants indicted and tried by juries composed of white men. Martin v. Texas, \n200 \nU.S. 316, 320\n, 321 S., 26 Sup. Ct. 338; Thomas v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 278, 282\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 393.\n A further objection that plaintiffs in error were prejudiced by the refusal of the court below to permit them in examining the jurors to inquire whether they distinguished between socialists and anarchists is likewise disposed of by previous decisions. Spies v. Illinois, \n123 U.S. 131\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 22; Thiede v. Utah Territory, \n159 U.S. 510\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 62; Holt v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 245, 248\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 2, 20 Ann. Cas. 1138\n\n\n It is contended that plaintiffs in error were not tried by a jury of the state and district in which the crime was committed, in violation of the Sixth Amendment, because the jurors were drawn not from the entire district but only from one division thereof. The proposition disregards the plain text of the Sixth Amendment, the contemporary construction placed upon it by the Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 Stat. 73, 88, c. 20,  29) expressly authorizing the drawing of a jury from a part of the district, and the continuous legislative and judicial practice from the beginning. Section 802, Revised Statutes; section 277, Judicial Code (Comp. St. 1916 ,  1254); Agnew v. United States, \n165 \nU.S. 36, 43\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 235; United States v. Wan Lee (D.

C.) 187 Fed. 355, 359, 362.\n It is argued that the court below erred in refusing to quash the indictment on the ground that it had been found 'without a sworn charge previously made.' It is settled \n\n[245 U.S. 480, 483]\n\u00a0\n that such a charge is unnecessary. Frisbie v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 160, 163\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 586; Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43, 59\n, 60 S., 26 Sup. Ct. 370.\n Further, it is said, the indictment was insufficient because it did not allege that Schue, who it was charged refused to register, was a citizen of the United States or was a person not an alien enemy who had declared his intention to become such citizen. But this overlooks the fact that although only the persons described were subject to military duty under the terms of the act, by section 5 'all male persons between the ages of 21 and 30 both inclusive' (with certain exceptions not here material) were required to register. It was sufficient to charge, therefore, as the indictment did, that Schue was a male person between the designated ages.\n The contention that more than one offense was charged in the same indictment is without merit. Section 332 of the Criminal Code provides that:\n'Whoever directly commits any act constituting an offense defined in any law of the United States, or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is a principal.'\n\n The indictment, therefore, charged but one offense-the refusal of Schue to register-plaintiffs in error being charged as principals in procuring such refusal. And this also disposes of a further contention based upon the same misconception that as at common law there could be no accessory to a misdemeanor, no offense was charged in the indictment.\n Other errors are assigned but we do not expressly notice them, some because they are not urged in argument, others because they are so unsubstantial as not to require even statement, and we content ourselves with saying that after a careful examination of the whole record we find no error and the judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAALFIELD v.

No guns having been delivered under the contract, it was annulled by the Chief of Ordinace, with the approval of the Secretary of War in an order, notice of which was given to the claimants on January 17, 1901. The appellant is the administrator of the survivor of one of two claimants, to whom we shall refer in this opinion as 'the claimants.'\n The essential parts of the contract to be considered are as follows:\n'The muzzle velocity shall not be less than 2,600 f. s. with a good smokeless powder that shall not give a pressure of over 40,000 pounds per square inch, using a projectile of 55 pounds weight for the 5- inch gun and 100 pounds weight for the 6-inch gun. ... The system of rapid-fire breech mechanism employed will be either the Brown or Dashiell, and must meet with the approval of the Ordnance Department . ... It must permit of being easily and conveniently operated, and permit the same man to traverse, elevate, sight and fire, without moving the eye from the sight. ... The first gun manufactured will be fired with full service charges of powder, such as that used in testing other rapid fire guns \n\n[246 U.S. 610, 612]\n\u00a0\n of similar caliber, and with not more than the regular service pressure for ordnance, and the gun must be fired for endurance 3 0 rounds or less as rapidly as practicable at the proving grounds of the manufacturers, commencing as soon as the gun is completed and continue firing as the Department may require, 5 rounds to be fired with pressure of about 45,000 pounds, and shall not exceed 50,000 pounds, these to be included in but at the close of the test, and the acceptance of the remainder of the same caliber will depend upon the type gun passing its test satisfactorily. ...\n\n'Both gun and carriage must endure these tests in all respects satisfactorily, both as to the strength of material and facility of operation. ...\n\n'It is stipulated and agreed that the party of the first part shall deliver for test the first complete gun with mount, etc., within three months from the date of execution of this contract. ...\n\n'If any doubts or disputes arise as to the meaning of anything in this or any of the papers hereunto attached, and forming this contract, the matter shall be at once referred to the Chief of Ordnance, U. S. Army, for determination. If, however, the party of the first part shall feel aggrieved at any decision of the Chief of Ordnance, it shall have the right to submit the same to the Secretary of War, and his decision shall be final.'\n\n'(5) If any default shall be made by the parties of the first part in delivering all or any of the guns, etc., mentioned in this contract, of the quality and at the times and places herein specified, then, in that case, the said party of the second part may supply the deficiency by purchase in open market or otherwise (the articles so procured to be of the kind herein specified as near as practicable), and the said parties of the first part shall be charged with the expense resulting from such failure. Nothing contained in this stipulation shall be construed to prevent the Chief \n\n[246 U.S. 610, 613]\n\u00a0\n of Ordnance, at his option, upon the happening of any such default, from declaring this contract to be thereafter null and void, without affecting the right of the United States to recover for defaults which may have occurred.'\n\n It is apparent from these excerpts that the contract contemplates the making and testing of a 'type gun' of each caliber; that the acceptance of additional guns was dependent on this one 'passing its test satisfactorily,' and that the Chief of Ordnance and his superior officer, the Secretary of War, were to decide, not arbitrarily, but candidly and reasonably, whether the gun had satisfied the required test.

Ct. 352.\n The 5-inch test gun was to have been completed within three months from the date of the contract, but there were delays, assented to by the government, such that it was not completed for ten months, so that the first test began on March 8th of the following year (1899).\n The finding by the Court of Claims as to what occurred during this firing test, to which the type gun of 5-inch caliber was subjected, is as follows:\n'The test firing began with a pressure of 18,000 pounds per square inch, which was raised on the second round to 21,050 pounds, and on the third round to 32,800 pounds, with a muzzle velocity of 2,705 feet per second, and on the fourth round to 35,750 pounds pressure, with a muzzle velocity of 2,821 feet per second, on which round the carriage was injured, it not being strong enough to stand such high muzzle velocities.\n\n'The claimants then protested against the increases made in the powder charge and insisted that any charge that was sufficient to produce a muzzle velocity of 2,600 feet per second was all that was required by the contract, except for the five high-pressure rounds required at the close of the test. This question was submitted to the Chief of Ordnance before firing was continued and by him \n\n[246 U.S. 610, 614]\n\u00a0\n decided in favor of the claimants. Thereafter the powder charge was so adapted as to give this muzzle velocity of 2,600 feet per second as a general rule, except in the said five high-pressure rounds at the clo e of the test, which were fired with pressures of between 45, 000 and 50,000 pounds per square inch.On one of these high-pressure rounds, the 293d round, the breach bushing and jacket of the gun were cracked and the breech could not be opened by hand.\n\n'These breaks were repaired, but the mechanism repaired did not operate satisfactorily thereafter.\n\n'During the course of the test the gun was star-gauged by the government inspector about every 50 rounds, and these gaugings, at different times throughout the tests and at different points in the bore, indicated varying and shifting changes, both increases and decreases, in the diameters of different cross-sections of the bore, the gauging at several times and places indicating a reduction of the normal diameter of 5 inches down to 4.99 inches; and as a precaution against the danger of rupture or explosion of the gun by a reduction of the bore sufficient to cause the projectile to stick in the bore when the gun was fired an iron plug of the diameter of the projectile was passed through the bore about every 10 or 12 rounds, on one of which occasions, about the 100th round, it stuck in the bore so tight at one point as to require the efforts of three men to force it through with a pole.\n\n'At all times, with this exception, the plug passed through freely.\n\n'These reductions and variations in the diameter of the bore of the gun were to some extent due to deposits of metal on the walls of the bore by abrasion from the projectile in its passage from the gun, but were principally due to changes in the cross section of the bore from a round to an elliptical form, resulting from a shifting of the segments enveloping the liner tube by the explosion of the charge, and also to an \n\n[246 U.S. 610, 615]\n\u00a0\n actual contraction of the bore by the compression of the liner tube forming the walls of the bore by the elastic tension of the wire with which the tube and its enveloping segments were wound and bound together, which tension, with the further increase therein resulting from the explosion of the charge upon reaction after the explosion, exercised a compressing effect upon the liner tube.\n\n'In large guns of ordinary types of construction there is usually a slight contraction of bore during the first few rounds of firing, after which the gun settles down to a new condition, and thereafter the changes of bore diameter in a normal gun are almost entirely in the way of increase of diameter from erosion and abrasion.\n\n'While the variations and reductions in the diameter of the bore of the type gun indicated by the star gauging during the firing test did not quite reach a point of actual danger to the gun from rupture or explosion by sticking of the projectile in the bore in the process of firing they did reach the limit of safety in this respect, and created a reasonable apprehension of danger in the minds of the Chief of Ordnance and other officials of the War Department connected with the execution of the contract for the guns, and caused the Chief of Ordnance and the Secretary of War to refuse to pass and accept the type gun unless it should satisfactorily pass a further test of 100 additional rounds as proposed and recommended by the Chief of Ordnance in his indorsement of November 3, 1899, hereinafter set forth. This apprehension was heightened by the fact of the new and comparatively untried type of construction of the gun, and by its reversal of the usual behavior of guns of the ordinary types of construction in the way of its continued contractions and changes of bore in the course of extended use.'\n\n These findings of fact, which under the circumstances of this case, must be accepted as final (United States v. New York Indians, \n173 \nU.S. 464, 470\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 464; Cramp v. United States, \n239 U.S. 221\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 70), if considered independently of the report* \n\n[246 U.S. 610, 616]\n\u00a0\n of the Chief of Ordnance, yet to be discussed, obviously justify the conclusion that the test gun did not meet the cont act requirements.\n The carriage of this new and experimental type gun failed on the fourth round of firing, with a pressure well within the contract maximum; the gun itself developed such cracks in the breach bushing and jacket that the breech could not be opened by hand and did not work satisfactorily after repairs were made; and it showed unusual and abnormal changes in the bore which, while not resulting in an explosion, created, in the mind of the Chief of Ordnance, a reasonable apprehension of danger in the use of the gun, and in his judgment required that it be modified and that it be subjected to an additional firing test, before it could be accepted as having satisfactorily passed the test prescribed by the contract.\n The report of the Chief of Ordinance to the Secretary of War on the result of this contract test is dated November 3, 1899, and is as follows:\n'In the opinion of this office, while the type 5-inch gun is not deemed as satisfactory a gun as is desirable for service, yet its test has apparently met the contract requirements, and if certain modifications in the gun and its carriage shall be made in their further manufacture to remedy defects developed in the test, and in other respects be made to meet more fully the requirements of the department, to which propositions the company willingly agrees, it is recommended that the 5-inch type gun and its mount be accepted, subject, however, to the condition that, in view of the moderate pressure to which this gun has been subjected, the department fire it 100 additional rounds, or less, as it may deem expedient, with charges giving higher pressures and assimilating more nearly the pressures that would be experienced in actual service, and that in the further manufacture of the guns they shall be modified, at the expense of the company, \n\n[246 U.S. 610, 617]\n\u00a0\n so as to remedy any further defects that may be developed in these additional firings.'\n\n The claimant's contention is rested largely upon this clause in the above paragraph, viz.: 'Yet its test has apparently met the contract requirements.' And their argument is that the test which the gun must meet was prescribed by the contract; that the facts found, and especially this clause, show that it proved equal to the required test; that the subsequent annulling of the contract by the Chief of Ordnance, with the approval of the Secretary of War 'was not made and taken in good faith, but under a mistake so gross as to justify an inference of bad faith,' and that, therefore, the claimants are entitled to recover the damages prayed for.\n If this expression, so much relied upon, stood as the unqualified conclusion of the Chief of Ordnance and had been approved by the Secretary of War, the interpretation claimed for it might be justified, but the contextual setting of the clause shows clearly that in the opinion of the Chief of Ordnance 'defects [had] developed in the test,' which could be remedied only if certain modifications were made in the manufacture of both the gun and carriage, and that his understanding when making the report was that the claimants concurred in this conclusion and willingly agreed to conform to it.\n The clause of the report so emphasized is the expression of a soldier, not of a technical lawyer, and the paragraph of the report in which it is found, taken altogether, conveys to us the conviction that the Chief of Ordnance, while concluding that the gun was defective in design and construction, nevertheless believed that it contained elements of invention which, modified and improved, would make of it a weapon of value to his country and that he was eager to lend official assistance to its further development, which he believed the claimants were equally eager to receive and profit by. In the interpretation most favor- \n\n[246 U.S. 610, 618]\n\u00a0\n able to the claimants the report is an acceptance conditioned upon development and improvement of the gun which the Chief of Ordnance thought possible, but which conditions, as we shall see, the claima ts, perhaps because of less confidence in their invention, never attempted to satisfy.\n On January 31, 1900, this report of the Chief of Ordinance was approved by the Secretary of War and a week later the decision and recommendation thus approved were communicated to the claimants.\n But, instead of the co-operation which the Chief of Ordnance thought assured, the government next heard from the claimants through lawyers and then through a letter from the claimants themselves, asking the Secretary of War to suspend further action until argument could be heard, and stating that 'they had not as yet assented to any modification of the gun or carriage.'\n The Secretary of War replied to the lawyers that there was no question before him open to argument, but what, if any, reply was made to the letter of the claimants does not appear.\n However, long prior to this, on May 18, 1899, after the test firing had been suspended and three months before it was completed, it was suggested by the government to the claimants that they should furnish 'the mathematical computations and engineering considerations upon which their claim of strength of construction and other qualities of their gun were based.' No notice was taken of this suggestion for almost a year, and not until after claimants were officially notified of the approval by the Secretary of War of the report of the Chief of Ordnance of November 3, 1899. Thereafter, on February 17, 1900, the claimants notified the Chief of Ordnance that they had employed two expert mathematicians to work out the various problems connected with the construction of their gun, and suggesting that they would like to \n\n[246 U.S. 610, 619]\n\u00a0\n have 'an army officer of practical experience with artillery' assigned to co-operate with their selected experts and that they would compensate him for the service. Two days later the government acceded to this and authorized a major in the army to join in making the computations as auggested by the claimants.\n The finding of the Court of Claims does not show that anything further was done until, on January 17, 1901, almost three years after this three months' contract was to have been completed, when, after the claimants had permitted almost a year to pass without accepting the suggestion of the government that modifications should be made in the gun and carriage to cure the defects which the firing test had disclosed, the Chief of Ordnance, with the approval of the Secretary of War notified the claimants that, for failure to deliver an acceptable gun, their contract had been declared null and void. Against this conclusion the claimants protested and appealed to the Secretary of War for a revocation of the annullment order, but after hearing the claimants and their lawyers several times, the Secretary of War refused to revoke this order.\n A month after the revocation order, the experts, employed almost a year before by the claimants, rendered to their employers a report on the technical problems connected with the construction of the gun, which the government had called for almost two years before. This report the Court of Claims finds was 'upon the whole, favorable to the style of construction of the gun; but defects of construction were pointed out and remedies therefor suggested in the way of modifications in the construction.'\n This discussion of the findings of fact by the Court of Claims leads us unhesitatingly to the conclusion that the claim that the Secretary of War and the Chief of Ordnance acted in had faith or under a gross mistake is wholly \n\n[246 U.S. 610, 620]\n\u00a0\n unfounded and gratuitous; that, on the contrary, they dealt candidly, generously, even helpfully, with the claimants, and that the annullment of the contract under the circumstances was abundantly justified. The cause of the misfortune, which the claimants undoubtedly suffered, is not to be found in their treatment by the officials of the War Department but in their own refusal, from whatever cause, to accept the encouraging suggestion of the Chief of Ordn nce that the Department was willing, by generous dealing and co-operation, to assist them in carrying forward their experimental gun to a successful development.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 610, 4]\n\u00a0\n The claims made in argument that by various delays on its part the government, in some indefinite way, waived its right to annul the contract, and that this right to annul was suspended until report should be made on the technical problems involved, by the experts selected by the claimants, it is true with the co-operation of the government, but almost a year before, cannot be seriously considered. In the matter of delays the claimants were as much at fault and more, than the government, and the delay of the technical report for almost a year was reasonable ground for assuming that no report was likely to be made, or that if made it would not be favorable to the acceptance of the gun, which last, as we have seen, is shown by the finding of facts by the Court of Claims, to have been proved to be the case.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSALT LAKE INV CO. v. OREGON SHORT LINE R. CO.(1918)\nNo. 29\nArgued: March 8, 1918Decided: April 15, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. W. H. King, E. A. Walton, and M. E. Wilson, all of Salt Lake City, Utah, and T. T. Ansberry, of Washington, D. C., for\n Messrs. Henry W. Clark, of New York City,\n Messrs. W. Clark, of New York City, and George H. Smith, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A small parcel of land in Utah is here the subject of conflicting claims-one under a patent to Malcolm Mac- \n\n[246 U.S. 446, 447]\n\u00a0\n duff issued under the Pre-Emption Act, c. 16, 5 Stat. 453, and the other under an act, chapter 2, 16 Stat. 395, granting a right of way 'through the public lands' to the Utah Central Railroad Company. The court below sustained the latter claim, 46 Utah, 203, 148 Pac. 439, and the case is here on a writ of error allowed before the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, became effective.\n Macduff's pre-emption claim was initiated by settlement June 10, 1869; his declaratory statement was filed in the local land office July 21 of that year; he paid the purchase price and secured an entry January 19, 1871, and the patent was issued June 5, 1871\n\n\n The right of way was granted December 15, 1870. At that time the railroad was completed and in operation for its full length. Cong. Globe, 41st Cong. 2 Sess. 4512, 5635; Moon v. Salt Lake County, 27 Utah, 435, 442, 76 Pac. 222. It was constructed late in 1869 or early in 1870, after Macduff filed his declaratory statement and before he paid the purchase price or secured his entry.\n Continuously after 1860 the tract sought to be pre-empted was within the corporate limits of Salt Lake City, as defined by a public statute, but was never actually occupied as a town site nor attempted to be entered as such. The parcel in controversy is within that tract, is also within the exterior lines of the right of way, and is occupied and used for right of way purposes.\n The plaintiff in error is the successor in interest and title of Macdu f and the defendant in error is the like successor of the Utah Central Railroad Company.\n The Pre-Emption Act,  10, excluded from acquisition thereunder all lands 'within the limits of any incorporated town.' Thus the land which Macduff sought to pre-empt was not subject to pre-emption, and could no more be entered or acquired in that way than if it were in an Indian or military reservation. See Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 511. That is was not actually occupied as a \n\n[246 U.S. 446, 448]\n\u00a0\n town site, nor sought to be entered as such, is immaterial. As Mr. Justice Miller pointed out in Root v. Shields, 20 Fed. Cas. 1160, 1166, Congress did not confine the exclusion to such lands as were so occupied, or such as were subject to town site entry, but 'deemed the short way the best way- to exclude them all from the operation of the act by a general rule.' In that case the learned justice held a pre-emption entry of land within the corporate limits of Omaha 'illegal and void,' and said in that connection:\n'Again, the defect in the title was a legal defect; it was a radical defect. It was as if no entry had ever been made. By it Shields did not take even an equity. After he had gone through the process of making the entry, after he received the patent certificate, Shields had no more right, or title, or interest in the land than he had before. And as he had none, he could convey no interest in the land. By the deed which he made, and by the successive deeds which they received, his grantees took no more than he had, which was nothing at all.'\n\n In the case of Burfenning v. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Ry. Co., \n163 U.S. 321\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 1018, a plaintiff in ejectment relied on a patent issued under the homestead law, which adopted the excluding provision of the pre-emption act, and his title was challenged on the ground that the entry and patent were for land within in the corporate limits of Minneapolis. This court observing, first, that the record affirmatively disclosed that the land was in the city limits when the claim was initiated, and second, that the case was not one where a finding by the Land Department on a question of fact resting on parol evidence was sought to be drawn in question, held the patent void under the general rule that:\n'When by act of Congress a tract of land has been reserved from homestead and pre-emption, or dedicated to any special purpose, proceedings in the Land Department in defiance of such reservation or dedication, although culminating in a \n\n[246 U.S. 446, 449]\n\u00a0\n patent, transfer no title and may be challenged in an action at law.'\n\n Applying these views, we think Macduff's settlement and declaratory statement under the pre-emption act were of no effect. They neither conferred any right on him nor took any from the government. His claim was not merely irregular or imperfect, but was an impossible one under the law, and so the status of the land was not affected thereby. The land continued to be subject to the disposal of Congress and came within the terms of the right of way act as much as if he were making no claim to it. Of course, the presence on public land of a mere squatter does not except it from the operation of such an act containing, as here, no excepting clause.\n It is said that by the act of March 3, 1877, c. 113, 19 Stat. 392. Congress confirmed or provided for the confirmation of pre-emption claims such as this. Assuming, without so deciding, that the act is susceptible of this interpretation, we think it does not disturb rights which were conferred and became vested under the right of way act more than six years before.\n It seems also to be thought that the town-site law in some way prevented the right of way act from reaching public land within the city limits, but on examining both statutes we are persuaded thare is no basis for so thinking. Certainly it was not intended that the right of way should stop at the city limits, and, as the town-site law interposed no obstacle, we think the right of way act was intended to and did apply to the public land lying inside those limits over which the railroad had been constructed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAN PEDRO, L A & S L R.

The cases are so much alike that a reference to train No. 1 will suffice. It occupied 27 hours in a journey from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, 334 miles, although the schedule running time between those points was only 13 1\/2 hours. The train left Las Vegas on schedule time and with a fresh crew, but was subsequently detained by an unavoidable and unforeseeable accident (a landslide, requiring a detour over another railroad), so that when it reached Daggett, a point in the route 158.6 miles from Los Angeles, the prescribed 16-hour period had expired by more than an hour. At this point the engine crew was relieved, their places being taken by men sent from Otis, a division point 4 miles distant. The conductor and brakemen were not relieved, but continued on duty to the destination of the train at Los Angeles, passing through San Bernardino, which is a passenger terminal but not for through trains. The conductor and brakemen might have been relieved either at Daggett or at San Bernardino, but no effort to do this was made. The question upon the merits is whether the act of Congress required the company, under the circumstances, to relieve them. The contention of plaintiff in error and petitioner is rested upon conference ruling No. 88(b) of the Interstate Commerce Commission, published June 25, 1908, which, after quoting the first proviso of section 3 of the act:\n'Provided, that the provisions of this act shall not apply in any case of casualty or unavoidable accident or the act of God; nor where the delay was the result of a cause not known to the carrier or its officer or agent in charge of such employe at the time said employe left a terminal, and which could not have been foreseen'\n\n -added the following:\n'Any employe so delayed may thereafter continue on duty to the terminal or end of that run.

Act March 4, 1915, c. 153, 38 Stat. 1165. The act is entitled:\n'An act to promote the welfare of American seamen in the merchant marine of \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 191]\n\u00a0\n the United States; to abolish arrest and imprisonment as a penalty for desertion and to secure the abrogation of treaty provisions in relation thereto; and to promote safety at sea.'\n\n It contains numerous provisions intended to secure better treatment of seamen, and to secure for them better conditions of service.\n The libel charges a demand in Mobile, Alabama, for one-half part of the wages then earned by the seamen, and the refusal of the master to pay the amount which the libelants claimed to be due. The master paid each of them what he conceived to be due, deducting certain advances made to the men at Liverpool, England, where the seamen were signed.\n The facts are:\n The Talus is a British ship and the libelants and petitioners citizens or subjects of nations other than the United States and at the time of employment by the ship and before boarding her they received certain advances at Liverpool by the ship or its agents, a practice usual and customary and not forbidden by the laws of Great Britain. The advance did not, as to any libelant, exceed the amount of a month's wages.\n The libelants boarded the ship at Dublin, Ireland, December 1, 1916, and remained in her service until they left her at Mobile, Alabama.\n The ship arrived in American waters on February 11, 1917, off Port Morgan, from whence she proceeded immediately to Mobile, where she remained until after February 24th, and unloaded and loaded cargoes. During the voyage and at Mobile prior to February 22d, libelants received certain payments from the ship in cash and in articles purchased from it.\n On February 22d libelants demanded of the master of the ship payment of one-half of the wages earned by them to that date. The master then paid to them a sum which, with the cash paid them and the price of the articles \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 192]\n\u00a0\n purchased as stated above, together with the advances made in Liverpool, equaled or exceeded the one-half of the wages then earned by each of them from the commencement of his service for the ship. It was less, however, than such one-half wages if the advances at Liverpool had not been included in the credits. The master claimed that those advances should be deducted from the one-half wages, and did deduct them, and the sum or sums paid by the master to the libelants exceeded the amount of wages earned by them for the eleven days the ship had been in American waters. The libelants quit the ship February 24, 1917, and were logged as deserters on the same day.\n Under the foregoing statement of facts the question for decision is: Was the master entitled to make deduction from the seamen's pay in the amount of the advancements made at Liverpool? The District Court held that these advancements could not be deducted. 242 Fed. 954. The Circuit Court of Appeals reached the opposite conclusion. 248 Fed. 670, 160 C. C. A. 570. The pertinent section of the act for consideration reads:\n'Sec. 10. (a) That it shall be, and is hereby, made unlawful in any case to pay any seaman wages in advance of the time when he has actually earned the same, or to pay such advance wages, or to make any order, or note, or other evidence of indebtedness therefor to any other person, or to pay any person, for the shipment of seamen when payment is deducted or to be deducted from a seaman's wages. Any person violating any of the foregoing provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not less than $25 nor more than $100, and may also be imprisoned for a period of not exceeding six months, at the discretion of the court. The payment of such advance wages or allotment shall in no case except as herein provided absolve the vessel or the master or the \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 193]\n\u00a0\n owner thereof from the full payment of wages after the same shall have been actually earned, and shall be no defense to a libel suit or action for the recovery of such wages. If any person shall demand or receive, either directly or indirectly, from any seaman or other person seeking employment, as seaman, or from any person on his behalf, any remuneration whatever for providing him with employment, he shall for every such offense be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be imprisoned not more than six months or fined not more than $ 500.\n\n ...\n'(e) That this section shall apply as well to foreign vessels while in the waters of the United States, as to vessels of the United States, and any master, owner, consignee, or agent of any foreign vessel who has violated its provisions shall be liable to the same penalty that the master, owner, or agent of a vessel of the United States would be for similar violation.\n\n'The master, owner, consignee, or agent of any vessel of the United States, or of any foreign vessel seeking clearance from a port of the United States, shall present his shipping articles at the office of clearance, and no clearance shall be granted any such vessel unless the provisions of this section have been complied with.'\n\n The genesis and history of this legislation is found in U. S. Compiled Statutes 1916, volume 7, section 8323, annotated.\n The Dingley Act of June 26, 1884 (c. 121, 23 Stat. 55, 56), which is the origin of this section, contains terms much like those found in this act. That statute, as the present one, in the aspect now before us, was intended to prevent the evils arising from advanced payments to seamen, and to protect them against a class of persons who took advantage of their necessities and through whom vessels were obliged to provide themselves with seamen. These persons obtained assignments of the advanced wages of sailors. In many instances this was accomplished with \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 194]\n\u00a0\n little or no service to the men who were obliged to obtain employment through such agencies. In the Dingley Act it was made unlawful to pay seamen's wages before leaving the port at which he was engaged. In the present act it is made unlawful to pay seamen's wages in advance of the time when he has actually earned the same. The Act of 1884 by its terms applied as well to foreign vessels as to the vessels of the United States, and masters of foreign vessels violating the law were refused clearance from any port of the United States. The present statute is made to apply as well to foreign vessels while in the waters of the United States as to vessels of the United States.\n In the present statute, in the section from which we have just quoted, masters, owners, consignees, or owners of foreign vessels are made liable to the same penalties as are the like persons in case of vessels of the United States. Such persons in case the vessels are those of the United States or foreign vessels, seeking clearance in ports of the United States, are required to present their shipping articles at the office of clearance, and no clearance is permitted unless the provisions of the statute are complied with.\n The Act of 1884 came before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in the case of The State of Maine, 22 Fed. 734. In a clear and well-reasoned opinion by Judge Addison Brown the law was held not to apply to the shipment of seamen on American vessels in foreign ports. After some amendments in 1898, not important to consider in this connection, the matter came before this court in the case of Patterson v. Bark Eudora, \n190 U.S. 169\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 821, and it was held to apply to a British vessel shipping seamen at an American port, and, furthermore, that the act, as thus applied to a foreign vessel in United States waters, was constitutional. \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 195]\n\u00a0\n While the Seaman's Act of 1915 contains many provisions for the amelioration of conditions as to employment and care of seamen, in the aspect now involved we have called attention to the state of legislation and judicial decision when that act was passed. Did Congress intend to make invalid the contracts of foreign seamen so far as advance payments of wages is concerned, when the contract and payment was made in a foreign country where the law sanctioned such contract and payment? Conceding for the present purpose that Congress might have legislated to annul such contracts as a condition upon which foreign vessels might enter the ports of the United States, it is to be noted, that such sweeping and important requirement is not found specifically made in the statute. Had Congress intended to make void such contracts and payments a few words would have stated that intention, not leaving such an important regulation to be gathered from implication. There is nothing to indicate an intention, so far as the language of the statute is concerned, to control such matters otherwise than in the ports of the United States. The statute makes the payment of advance wages unlawful and affixes penalties for its violation, and provides that such advancements shall in no cases except as in the act provided, absolve the master from full payment after the wages are earned, and shall be no defense to a libel or suit for wages. How far was this intended to apply to foreign vessels? We find the answer if we look to the language of the act itself. It reads that this section shall apply to foreign vessels 'while in the waters of the United States.'\n Legislation is presumptively territorial and confined to limits over which the law-making power has jurisdiction. American Banana Company v. United Fruit Co., \n213 \nU.S. 347, 357\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047. In Patterson v. Bark Eudora, supra, this court declared such legislation as to foreign vessels in United States ports to be constitutional. We think that \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 196]\n\u00a0\n there is nothing in this section to show that Congress intended to take over the control of such contracts and payments as to foreign vessels except while they were in our ports. Congress could not prevent the making of such contracts in other jurisdictions. If they saw fit to do so, foreign countries would continue to permit such contracts and advance payments no matter what our declared law or policy in regard to them might be as to vessels coming to our ports.\n In the same section, which thus applies the law to foreign vessels while in waters of the United States, it is provided that the master, owner, consignee, or agent of any such vessel, who violates the provision of the act, shall be liable to the same penalty as would be persons of like character in respect to a vessel of the United States. This provision seems to us of great importance as evidencing the legislative intent to deal civilly and criminally with matters in our own jurisdiction. Congress certainly did not intend to punish criminally acts done within a foreign jurisdiction, a purpose so wholly futile is not to be attribution to Congress. United States v. Freeman, \n239 \nU.S. 117, 120\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 32. The criminal provision strengthens the presumption that Congress intended to deal only with acts committed within the jurisdiction of the United States.\n It is true the act provides for the abrogation of inconsistent treaty provisions, but this provision has ample application treating the statute to mean what we have here held to be its proper construction. It abolishes the right of arrest for desertion. It gives to the civil courts of the United States jurisdiction over wage controversies arising within our jurisdiction. These considerations amply account for the treaty provision. See Treaties in Force, Ed. 1904, index p. 969.\n It is said that the advances in foreign ports are against the policy of the United States and, therefore, not to be \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 197]\n\u00a0\n sanctioned here. As we have construed this section of the statute, no such policy as to foreign contracts legal where made, is declared.\n We have examined the references in the briefs of counsel to the reports and proceedings in Congress during the progress of this legislation so far as the same may have weight in determining the construction of this section of the act. We find nothing in them, so far as entitled to consideration, which requires a different meaning to be given the statute. We may add that the construction now given has the sanction of the Executive Department as shown in Instructions to Consular Officers, promulgated through the medium of the State Department.\n We are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals reached the right conclusion as to the meaning and interpretation of this section of the act, and its judgment is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, with whom concur Mr. Justice HOLMES, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n This is a libel in admiralty under the Seamen's Act of 1915 (38 Stat. 1165-1168), especially involving section 11 (Comp. St. 1916,  8392a).\n The libel was filed by petitioners here and others. It was dismissed as to the latter and they have acquiesced in the judgment. The facts are set out in the opinion of the court.\n With this case were submitted others that present the act of Congress in different aspects. Among these was No. 361. Dillon v. Strathearn S. S. Co., \n248 U.S. 182\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 83. It was a libel by a seaman who had shipped on a British vessel and was based on a demand for wages not due at the time of the demand under the terms of the shipping articles signed by him. Section 4 (section 8322) of the act, infra, was especially involved in consideration and its constitutionality \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 198]\n\u00a0\n was attacked by the ship. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to which the case had gone, presented the question to this court in two aspects, first generally, and, second, more particularly that provision which makes the section 'apply to seamen on foreign vessels while in the harbors of the United States.'\n In the present case the ship is also British and the libelants and petitioners citizens or subjects of nations other than the United States, and the controversy is as to the right of the master to deduct from the wages, of which the law authorizes the demand, advances made to the seamen in Liverpool, England. To make such advances was a practice usual and customary and not forbidden by English law. It would seem, therefore, that the constitutional question is as much involved in one case as in the other. But under the court's construction of the act that question can be pretermitted. Under our construction it would seem to be not only of ultimate but of first insistence. The court, however, is of opinion that the question of the constitutionality of the act was not certified in such manner as to be subject to its consideration. From that conclusion we are not disposed to dissent and shall assume, as the court does, that the legislation is valid and pass to its consideration.\n The instant case, the facts not being in dispute, is brought to the question of the right of the master to deduct the Liverpool advances, the ship asserting the right and the libelants denying it. The solution of the question necessarily depends upon the construction of the act, or, more precisely, its application. It is conceded, yielding to the authority of Patterson v. The Bark Eudora, \n190 U.S. 169\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 821, that the act applies to American seamen shipping in an American port upon foreign vessels, but it is contended from that case and other cases that it ought 'to seem plain on principle and authotity that the advancement on principle and authority that the advancement \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 199]\n\u00a0\n made to seamen within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.' And, indeed, it is insisted that Congress 'ex industria in terms confined the application to the waters of the United States.' The conclusions are deduced from the cases which are reviewed and the language of the act is quoted. We give the quotation as it amplifies the contentions:\n'That this section shall apply as well to foreign vessels while in waters of the United States [counsels' emphasis], as to vessels of the United States, and any master, owner, consignee, or agent of any foreign vessel who has violated its provisions shall be liable to the same penalty that the master, owner, or agent of a vessel of the United States would be for similar violation.\n\n'The master, owner, consignee, or agent of any vessel of the United States, or of any foreign vessel seeking clearance from a port of the United States, shall present his shipping articles at the office of clearance, and no clearance shall be granted any such vessel unless the provisions of this section have been complied with.'\n\n The quotation is but a part of section 11.1 It is preceded by \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 200]\n\u00a0\n the explicit declaration that it is 'unlawful in any case to pay any seaman wages in advance of the time when he has actually earned the same or to pay such advance wages.' There is no limitation of place or circumstances and the universality of the declaration is given emphasis and any implication of exception is precluded with tautological care by the provision that 'the payment of such advance wages or allotment shall in no case except as herein provided absolve the vessel or the master or the owner thereof from the full payment of wages after the same shall have been actually earned, and shall be no defense to a libel suit or action for the recovery of such wages.' To qualify these provisions or not to take them for what they say, would, in our opinion, ascribe to the act an unusual improvidence of expression. And section 4 should be considered in connection. It is hence important that we give it in full. And it may be said that it is an amendment to section 4530, R. S. (Comp. St. 1916,  8322). It is as follows:\n'Sec. 4530. Every seaman on a vessel of the United States shall be entitled to receive on demand from the master of the vessel to which he belongs one-half part of the wages which he shall have then earned at every port where such vessel, after the voyage has been commenced, shall load or deliver cargo before the voyage is ended and all stipulations in the contract to the contrary shall be void: Provided, such a demand shall not be made before the expiration of, nor oftener than once in five days. Any failure on the part of the master to comply with this demand shall release the seaman from his contract and \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 201]\n\u00a0\n he shall be entitled to full payment of wages earned. And when the voyage is ended every such seaman shall be entitled to the remainder of the wages which shall then be due him, as provided in section forty-five hundred and twenty-nine of the Revised Statutes: ... And provided further, that this section shall apply to seamen on foreign vessels while in harbors of the United States, and the courts of the United States shall be open to such seamen for its enforcement.'\n\n This section and the others we have quoted express something more than particular relations of ship and seaman, they express the policy of the United States which no private conventions, no matter where their locality of execution, can be adduced to contravence. The Kensington, \n183 U.S. 263\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 102; United States v. Chavez, \n228 U.S. 525\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 595; United States v. Freeman, \n239 U.S. 117\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 32. Nor are we called upon to assign the genesis of the policy or trace the evolution of its remedy to the act in controversy; and besides it has been done elsewhere. It is enough to say that the act itself demonstrates that it is intended as a means in the development of the merchant marine and it hardly needs to be added, to quote counsel for the government, 'that the welfare of the seaman is remarkably interrelated with that of the merchant marine.' This certainly was the conception of Congress and answers the contentions based on contrary opinion and deductions. It is manifest also from the title of the act, which declares its purpose to be 'to promote the welfare of American seamen in the merchant marine of the United States; to abolish arrest and imprisonment as a penalty for desertion, and to secure the abrogation of treaty provisions in relation thereto; and to promote safety at sea.' Its efficacy as a means or the policy of the means is not submitted to our judgment. Ours is the simple service of interpretation, and there is no reason to hesitate in its exercise because of supposed consequences. The policy \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 202]\n\u00a0\n of the act was so insistent that Congress did not hesitate to abrogate opposing treaties. Certainly, therefore, we cannot give a controlling force to the suggestion that to construe the act as the ship construes it and others, supporting the ship, construe it, is to 'impose our conception of the rights of seamen upon the whole world in violation of the comity of nations.' The reply is immediate: It was for Congress to estimate this and other results and to consider how far they were counterpoised or overcome by other considerations. If the section was ambiguous the asserted results might be invoked to resolve its meaning; but we do not think it is ambiguous.\n It must be conceded, indeed, it is conceded, that the words of the sections are grammatically broad enough to include all seamen, foreign as well as American, and advances and contracts, wherever made, and to the contention that Congress had in mind and was only solicitous for American seamen, the answer is again immediate: The contention would take us from the certainty of language to the uncertainties of construction dependent upon the conjecture of consequences; take us from the deck to the sea, if we may use a metaphor suggested by our subject. Language is the safer guide, for it may be defined; consequences brought forward to modify its meaning may be in fact and effect disputed-foreseen, it may be, and accepted as necessary to the achievement of the purpose of the law. And the purpose is resolute, has been maintained for many years with increasing care, and the ship, being in the waters of the United States, not the nationality of the seamen, selected as its test. And lest there might be impediment in treaties, they are declared, so far as they impede, to be abrogated.\n But authority may be adduced against the contentions. In Patterson v. Bark Eudora, supra, the Seamen's Act came under consideration, and it was contended, as it is contended now, that the title determined against the body \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 203]\n\u00a0\n of the act and that therefore the act did not apply to foreign vessels notwithstanding its explicit words. The contention was declared untenable and the reasoning of the court exhausts discussion on that and the other contentions as to the purpose and power of Congress. Of the first it was said that it was to protect sailors against certain wrongs practiced upon them, one of the most common being the advancement of wages; of the second it was said, quoting Chief Justice Marshall:\n'The jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute; it is susceptible of no limitation not imposed by itself.' The Exchange, 7 Cranch, 116.\n\n The nationality of the seamen does not appear, but the vessel was foreign, and the application of the statute to the latter constituted the ground of controversy.\n Of course, the language of an act, though universal, may find limitation in the jurisdiction of the Legislature; but certainly a ship within the harbors of the United States is within the jurisdiction of the United States, and making its exercise 'apply to seamen on foreign vessels,' and 'the courts of the United States ... open to such seamen for its enforcement' was the judgment of Congress of the way to promote its purpose.\n These considerations, we think, answer as well other contentions; that is, that the act 'should be construed as applicable only to seamen shipping in an American port on vessels which remain for a time in or afterwards return to an American port to load or deliver cargo' or 'to seamen of American nationality upon foreign or domestic vessels, irrespective of the port of shipment.'\n It is enough to say of the contentions, in addition to what has been said, that they impose on the statute qualifications and limitations precluded by its words and the purpose they express. There is a great deal said, and ably said, upon these contentions and the more pretentious one that the act would violate the Constitution of the \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 204]\n\u00a0\n United States unless so 'construed as not to apply to foreign seamen shipped on a foreign vessel in a foreign port, under a contract, valid where made. ...'\n We cannot concede the qualification nor doubt the power of Congress to impose conditions upon foreign vessels entering or remaining in the harbors of the United States. And we think that the case of The Eudora declares the grounds of decision. Its principle is broader than its instance and makes the vessel and its locality in the waters of the United States the test of the application of the act and not the nationality of the seamen nor their place of shipment, nor contravening conventions, and precludes deductions of advances.\n Nor is there obstacle in the penal provisions of the act. They may be distributively applied and such application has many examples in legislation. It is justified by the rule of reddendo singula singulis. By it words and provisions are referred to their appropriate objects, resolving confusion and accomplishing the intent of the law against, it may be, a strict grammatical construction. United States v. Simms, 1 Cranch, 252; Comm. v. Barber, 143 Mass. 560, 10 N. E. 330; Quinn v. Lowell Electric Light Co., 140 Mass. 106, 3 N. E. 200. The Seamen's Act especially invokes the application of the rule. The act applies to foreign vessels as explicitly and a circumstantially as it does to domestic vessels. Let the foreign vessel be in the waters of the United States and every provision of the act applies to it as far as it can apply. In other words, it gives the right to a seaman on a foreign vessel to demand from the master one-half part of the wages which he shall have earned at every port and makes void all stipulations to the contrary. And the remedy of the seaman in such case is made explicit. If his demand be refused ('failure on the part of the master to comply' are the words of the act) the seaman is released from his contract and he is entitled to the full payment of wages earned. And he is \n\n[248 U.S. 185, 205]\n\u00a0\n given a remedy in the courts of the United States. The defense of an advance payment is precluded and clearance of the foreign vessel is forbidden. And thus the act has completeness of right and remedy and, we think, precludes judicial limitation of either. Its provisions are simple and direct, there is no confusion in their command, no difficulty in their obedience. Of course, a 'master, owner, consignee or agent of' any foreign vessel, to quote the words of the act again, cannot violate any provision of it if he be not in the United States. If there be provisions that cannot reach him, that with which this case is concerned can reach him.\n We are, therefore, of opinion that the District Court was right in refusing to allow the Liverpool advances and the Circuit Court of Appeals was wrong in reversing the ruling. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 11 was an amendment of section 24 of the Act of December 21, 1898, and section 24 was an amendment of section 10 of the laws of 1884 as amended in 1886, and, as it now stands as far as pertinent, is as follows:\n'Sec. 10. (a) That it shall be, and is hereby, made unlawful in any case to pay any seaman wages in advance of the time when he has actually earned the same, or to pay such advance wages, or to make any order, or note, or other evidence of indebtedness therefor to any other person, or to pay any person, for the shipment of seamen when payment is deducted or to be deducted from a seaman's wages. Any person violating any of the foregoing provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not less than $25 nor more than $100, and may also be imprisoned for a period of not exceeding six months, at the discretion of the court. The payment of such advance wages or allotment shall in no case except as herein provided absolve the vessel or the master or the owner thereof from the full payment of wages after the same shall have been actually earned, and shall be no defense to a libel suit or action for the recovery of such wages. If any person shall demand or receive, either directly or indirectly, from any seaman ... or from any person on his behalf, any remuneration whatever for providing him with employment, he shall for every such offense be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be imprisoned not more than six months or fined not more than $500.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSEARS v. CITY OF AKRON(1918)\nNo. 105\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 242, 243]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George W. Wickersham, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. John E. Morley, of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Akron, Ohio, lies on Little Cuyahoga river a short distance above its confluence with the Big Cuyahoga. In May, 1911, the Legislature of Ohio granted to the city, by special act 'the right to divert and use forever' for \n\n[246 U.S. 242, 244]\n\u00a0\n the purposes of its water supply 'the Tuscarawas river, the Big Cuyahoga and Little Cuyahoga rivers and the tributaries thereto, now wholly or partly owned or controlled by the State.' \n1\n The city already possessed, under the general laws of Ohio, power to appropriate for this purpose, by condemnation proceedings, the property of any private corporation. \n2\n Acting specifically in exercise of the power conferred by the special act and of every other power thereunto enabling, the city, by resolution of its council, passed May 27, 1912, declared its intention to appropriate all the waters, above a point fixed, of the Cuyahoga river and tributaries; and by an ordinance, passed August 26, 1912, it appropriated the same, directed its solicitor to apply to the courts to assess the compensation to be paid, and provided for the payment of 'the costs and expenses of said appropriation' out of an issue of bonds theretofore authorized. The city then con- \n\n[246 U.S. 242, 245]\n\u00a0\n structed a dam and reservoir at the place specified and announced its intention of diverting the water before or by August 1, 1915\n\n\n On July 24, 1915, John H. Sears, a citizen of New York, filed in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Ohio this suit, praying that the further construction of dam and reservoir and the diversion of the water of the river be enjoined, and alleged, in substance, the following facts: The Cuyahoga River Power Company, a hydro-electric corporation was organized under the general laws of Ohio,3 in 1908. The character of the company's enterprise is described in Cuyahoga River Power Co. v. Northern Realty Co., \n244 U.S. 300\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 643; and its possible rights were considered in Cuyahoga River Power Co. v. Akron, \n240 U.S. 462\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 402. On July 15, 1915, the company de- \n\n[246 U.S. 242, 246]\n\u00a0\n livered to him as trustee a deed of trust of all its property to secure an issue of $150,000 of bonds. The property rights or interests which it is alleged the city was about to appropriate and for which it had not paid and proposed not to pay, arose from these transactions of the company:\n It caused to be made and had, on or about June 3, 1908, adopted by resolution of its board of directors, surveys, maps and plans known as the 'Roberts-Abbot Plan.' Later it caused to be made and, about April 23, 1909, adopted by resolution of its board of directors, supplemental surveys, maps and a plan, known as the 'Von Schon Plan,' together with description of the several parcels of land required for carrying it out. The first plan provided for development, on the Big Cuyahoga, above the confluence of the Big and Little Cuyahoga rivers, within the limits of the location and plan of development set forth in its certificate of incorporation; and the papers also described the various parcels of land which the company would require for the purpose. The supplemental plan called for the extensive development including most of the rivers of northeastern Ohio, and provided, among other things, for a dam on the Big Cuyahoga above that of the city. It was confessedly beyond the powers conferred by the original certificate of incorporation. That certificate was not amended to include the necessary additional powers until after the passage of the Act of 1911. No public record or filing was made of either of those plans; and the law of Ohio makes no provision for such filing or for any record except that involved in condemnation proceedings. No condemnation proceeding was taken except that instituted June 5, 1908, under the original plan. It does nor appear that any property was acquired under these proceedings. Shortly before the commencement of this suit, the company acquired, at a point some distance below the city's dam, a small parcel of \n\n[246 U.S. 242, 247]\n\u00a0\n land, which however, extended only to high-water mark. It also acquired at another place below defendant's dam from another riparian owner, a contract for a portion of the river bed and the right to regulate, as to this land, the flow of the river; and acquired options for certain other properties. But the company has not commenced anywhere on the river any part of the proposed water-power development.\n The right or property which the bill seeks to protect is mainly, if not wholly, the alleged right to construct and operate in places designated in the certificate of incorporation, the power system described, without danger of impairment by any act of defendants. The bill alleges that the company 'became possessed of and vested with the right to exercise the State's power of eminent domain in order to appropriate and acquire for its own corporate purposes such private property as it deemed necessary for carrying out and performing the matters and things set forth in its said articles of incorporation'; and that the city's proposed action would impair contract rights of the company and also take its property without compensation in violation of the Federal Constitution. The city moved to dismiss the bill, contending that it did not appear from plaintiff's allegations that any contract rights of the company had been impaired or that the city had taken or used, or threatened or proposed to take or use any property of the company; that, on the contrary, the bill showed that the company had no property right which the city's action taken or proposed would involve appropriating; and that, for this reason, it had refrained from including in the condemnation proceedings instituted by it, any alleged property rights of the company, and had not given to it any notice of the city's takings.\n The motion to dismiss the bill was sustained by the District Court, on the ground that the company did not possess any such contract right or property as the city \n\n[246 U.S. 242, 248]\n\u00a0\n was alleged to have impaired or invaded or threatened to appropriate; and also on the ground that the bill did not set forth facts entitling plaintiff to seek relief in equity and did disclose laches. A decree was entered dismissing the bill; and a direct appeal to this court was taken under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [Comp. St. 1916,  1215]).\n First. As to the alleged impairment of contract: Plaintiff contends that the incorporation of the company in 1908 under the general laws constituted a contract by which the State granted it the right to construct and operate a power system in the places designated in the certificate and the right to take property for that purpose and to have the water flow past that property uninterrupted and undiminished; and that the ordinance of 1912 is a law which impairs that contract in violation of article 1,  10, of the Federal Constitution. It is clear that the contract right created by incorporation alone was not illegally impaired by the ordinance, because there was no contract by the State with reference to the water rights. Incorporation did not imply an agreement that the quantity of water available for development by the company would not be diminished. St. Anthony Falls Water Power Co. v. St. Paul Water Commissioners, \n168 \nU.S. 349, 371\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 157. The so- called charter simply conferred upon the company the power to take lands necessary for and to construct thereon, the dams, locks, and other parts of its plant. \n4\n If by purchase or by right of eminent do- \n\n[246 U.S. 242, 249]\n\u00a0\n main under the charter powers, the company becomes the owner of riparian lands, it acquires the riparian rights of former owners; or it may otherwise acquire from the owners specific rights in the use and flow of the water. But these would be property acquired under the charter, not contract rights expressed or implied in the grant of the charter. Furthermore, the contract inhering in the charter (as distinguished from property acquired under the charter) was subject to the State's reserved power to amend or repeal, as provided in article 13,  2, of the Ohio Constitution. Ramapo Water Co. v. City of New York, \n236 \nU.S. 579, 583\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 442. The Act of 1911, under which the city proceeded, may be treated as an amendment of the company's charter making its rights subject to those of the city, if that if necessary to justify the proceeding of the city, which the act authorized. See State v. City of Hamilton, 47 Ohio St. 52, 74, 23 N. E. 935; Hamilton Gas Light Co. v. Hamilton City, \n146 U.S. 258\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 90; Berea College v. Kentucky, \n211 \nU.S. 45, 57\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 33.\n Second. As to the alleged property rights: It follows from what has been said above, that at least until something more had occurred than incorporation, the city was free as against the Cuyahoga Company to appropriate \n\n[246 U.S. 242, 250]\n\u00a0\n any of the land or any of the water rights which might otherwise have come under the development described in its certificate of incorporation. Plaintiff contends, however, that it became vested with an indefeasible property right to proceed with its development (a) when by resolution the board of directors adopted the plan or (b) when condemnation proceedings were begun. Whether the adoption of a plan by the company would, under the general laws of Ohio, have vested in it such a preferential right as against rival power companies or other municipalities, we have no occasion to consider. For it is clear that Ohio retained the power as against one of its creatures, to revoke any such right to appropriate property until it had been acted upon by acquiring the property authorized to be taken. Adirondack Railway v. New York State, \n176 U.S. 335\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 460; and the Act of 1911 and the ordinance were both passed before the company had acquired any property. Nor are we called upon to determine to what extent the commencement of the acquisition of needed property in preparation for the power development, or even actual commencement of construction would have vested in the company the right to complete the development. For the property alleged to be now owned by the company was not acquired by it until after the city's development had been practically completed; and no work of construction has ever been commenced by the company.\n Third. As to the alleged riparian rights: These consist of (a) the small parcel of land extending to high-water mark, which was acquired nearly three years after the ordinance of August 26, 1912 was passed; and ( b) a contract with one Boettler for a portion of the river bed with a right to regulate flowage; and (c) certain options for other lands and rights, all of which also seem to have been acquired after the city's water development was practically completed. The city insists that the bill fails to show that it has taken or proposes to take or will injure \n\n[246 U.S. 242, 251]\n\u00a0\n any of these, and also that it does not appear that the company has, in respect to any of these properties, any riparian right which conceivably could be taken or injured. This contention, which involves matters of state law, may possibly raise some questions presented to the state courts in Boettler v. Akron, 93 Ohio St. 490, 113 N. E. 1069. But whether it is in all respects sound, we need not determine; for it is clear that, upon the facts alleged in the bill, the rights of the plaintiff in this property and the injury thereto, if any, are not such as to entitle him to relief in equity.\n Fourth. Plaintiff contends that the ordinance is void because the general statute which authorized the appropriation violates both article 1 ,  10, of the Federal Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment, in that it authorizes the municipality to determine the necessity for the taking of private property without the owners having an opportunity to be heard as to such necessity; that in fact no necessity existed for any taking which would interfere with the company's project; since the city might have taken water from the Little Cuyahoga or the Tuscarawas rivers; and furthermore that it has taken ten times as much water as it can legitimately use. It is well settled that while the question whether the purpose of a taking is a public one is judicial, Hairson v. Danville & Western Railway, \n208 U.S. 598\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 331, 13 Ann. Cas. 1008, the necessity and the proper extent of a taking is a legislative question. Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 298\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 361; United States v. Gettysburg Electric Ry. Co., \n160 \nU.S. 668, 685\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 427; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 65\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 667. The Legislature may refer such issues, if controverted, to the court for decision. P. C. C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. City of Greenville, 69 Ohio St. 487, 69 N. E. 976.\n Fifth. As a further ground for relief, plaintiff asserts that the whole water development of the city has been carried on without authority in law. The contention is, that the general statute on which the ordinance rests is \n\n[246 U.S. 242, 252]\n\u00a0\n inconsistent with the new constitution, adopted September 3, 1912; that though the ordinance was passed before the new constitution took effect, it was not acted upon until after; and that therefore it was not within the saving clause and was repealed. Inconsistency is asserted for the reason that under the statute the city council possessed the full power to determine whether the city should undertake the water development, whereas the new constitution provided a right to a referendum on the subject, upon filing, within thirty days from the passage of the ordinance, a petition 'signed by ten per centum of the electors of the municipality.' Article 18 ,  5. The bill alleges that the ordinance did not take effect until September 10, 1912; but the new constitution did not become effective until November 15, 1912. The ordinance was therefore, a valid existing law when the new constitution became operative and was not repealed by it. The fact that no action may have been taken under the ordinance is immaterial. We need not, therefore, inquire whether plaintiff is in a position to avail himself of the alleged inconsistency.\n Sixth. The city insists that it has not appropriated and does not intend to appropriate any property of plaintiff, and that, as to plaintiff, it is not exercising the power of eminent domain. If, as plaintiff contends, the city's whole water development is unauthorized, plaintiff clearly is not entitled to equitable relief. For then, the city's act in damming and diverting water would be that of an ordinary wrongdoer, for which riparian proprietors above or below, who are injured, would have only the usual remedy for a tort by an action at law for damages, unless exceptional circumstances render resort to a court of equity appropriate. Parker v. Winnipiseogee Lake Cotton & Woolen Co., 2 Black 545; Osborne v. Missouri Pacific Railway, \n147 \nU.S. 248, 259\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 299. No such circumstance exist here. The bill shows clearly that, a least for the present, \n\n[246 U.S. 242, 253]\n\u00a0\n the company cannot, by any conceivable diversion, be injured in any riparian properties and rights it may have; for it has not even commenced the construction of its projected power system, nor otherwise utilized the small parcel which it acquired shortly before this suit was instituted. Even if the company had riparian rights and should hereafter proceed with its development it might prove that defendant's diversion was of such a character that it would not substantially affect the company's use, McElroy v. Goble, 6 Ohio St. 187; or the circumstances might conceivably be such that the city would be held not to have exceeded its legal rights as riparian owner. City of Canton v. Shock, 66 Ohio St. 19, 63 N. E. 600, 58 L. R. A. 637, 90 Am. St. Rep. 557; Moody & Thomas Milling Co. v. City of Akron, 93 Ohio St. 484, 113 N. E. 835; Cleveland-Akron Bag Co. v. City of Akron, 93 Ohio St. 486, 113 N. E. 835.\n The absence of facts entitling plaintiff to equitable relief is not supplied by such general allegations of fraud and insolvency as the plaintiff has made.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act (House Bill No. 357) of May 17, 1911, Ohio Laws, vol. 102, p. 175:\n An act to provide for granting to the City of Akron, Ohio, the right to use and occupy certain waters and lands of the State for water works and park purposes.\n Section 1.

C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Thompson, for the District of Columbia.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal by claimant in a suit that was commenced by her testator in the Court of Claims in the year 1880, under Act of June 16, 1880 (chapter 243, 21 Stat. 284). A judgment was rendered in claimant's favor after the amendatory Act of February 13, 1895, c. 87, 28 Stat. 664 ( Johnson, Adm'r, v. D. C., 31 Ct. Cl. 395), which judgment was reversed by this court in 1897, and the cause remanded for further proceedings. District of Columbia v. Johnson, \n165 U.S. 330\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 362. After a long delay, proceedings were had which resulted in a judgment in favor of claimant February 21, 1916, from which the District of Columbia has not appealed.\n Claimant's appeal relates to the question of interest \n\n[246 U.S. 338, 340]\n\u00a0\n upon the amount recovered. The form of the judgment is that the claimant 'do have and recover of and from the District of Columbia in the manner provided by the act of June 16, 1880, chapter 243, seven thousand three hundred and six dollars and twenty-five cents ($7,306.25). Said amounts were due and payable April 1, 1876, but said judgment shall bear interest only from the date of its rendition, and is payable as provided by section 6 of the Act of June 16, 1880 (21 Stat. L. p. 284), as amended by the Act of March 3, 1881 (21 Stat. L. p. 466).' There is no finding that the claim is based upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest.\n It is insisted that the court erred in allowing interest only from the date of judgment, rather than from April 1, 1876, the day on which the claim became due and payable.\n The act of 1880, in its first section, conferred jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims over all claims then existing the District of Columbia arising out of certain operations of the District government during the preceding decade; and as to procedure it declared:\n'Said Court of Claims shall have the same power, proceed in the same manner, and be governed by the same rules, in respect to the mode of hearing, adjudication, and determination of said claims, as it now has in relation to the adjudication of claims against the United States.'\n\n This, if it stood alone, would leave the question of interest to be governed by the general principle that interest is not recoverable from the government, embodied in section 1091, Rev. Stat.:\n'No interest shall be allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment thereon by the Court of Claims, unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest,' still in force as section 177, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1141 [Comp. St. 1916,  1168]).\n\n But other sections of the act of 1880 contain provisions that must be considered. By section 5 it was enacted that, where no appeal was taken, or on affirmance of a judgment \n\n[246 U.S. 338, 341]\n\u00a0\n in favor of the claimant, 'the sum due thereby shall be paid, as hereinafter provided, by the Secretary of the Treasury,' upon presentation to him of a copy of the judgment properly certified. And by section 6 the Secretary was authorized to demand of the sinking fund commissioner of the District of Columbia so many of the 3.65 per cent. bonds authorized by Act of Congress approved June 20, 1874 (chapter 337, 18 Stat. 120), and amendatory acts, as might be necessary for the payment of the judgments; 'which bonds shall be received by said claimants at par in payment of such judgments, and shall bear date August first, eighteen hundred and seventy- four, and mature at the same time as other bonds of this issue; provided, that before the delivery of such bonds as are issued in payment of judgments rendered as aforesaid on the claims aforesaid, the coupons shall be detached therefrom from the date of said bonds to the day upon which such claims were due and payable; and the gross amount of such bonds heretofore and hereafter issued shall not exceed in the aggregate fifteen millions of dollars.' By amendment of March 3, 1881 (chapter 134, 21 Stat. 458, 466), the Treasurer of the United States as ex officio sinking fund commissioner was authorized, whenever in his opinion it would be more advantageous for the interest of the District of Columbia to do so, to sell the bonds and pay the judgments from the proceeds of the sales instead of delivering the bonds to the claimants.\n Under the act of 1880, the Court of Claims held that it was necessary it should determine when the claims were due and payable within the meaning of the act, and specify the date in the judgment, in order that the Secretary of the Treasury might know what coupons, if any, were to be detached from bonds delivered by him in payment. Fendall's Case, 16 Ct. Cl. 106, 121. See District of Columbia v. Johnson, \n165 \nU.S. 330, 336\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 362.\n Construing sections 1, 5, and 6 of the act of 1880 in connec- \n\n[246 U.S. 338, 342]\n\u00a0\n tion with section 1091, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St. 1916,  1168), it is plain that the claimant in such a judgment is not entitled to a recovery of interest as such, saying any that may accrue after the rendition of the judgment, unless the recovery be based upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest. Section 6, however, provided a special fund out of which claims of this character might be paid, and as this consisted of coupon bonds dated in 1874 and maturing 50 years later, the provision to the effect that coupons maturing after the date upon which the claim was due and payable should accompany the bonds amounted to giving interest at a limited rate, before and after judgment, where payment was made in that mode.\n But this special mode of payment was qualified by a proviso that the gross amount of such bonds should not exceed $15,000,000; and, as it happens, all except $2,700 had been issued prior to the entry of the judgment now under review. This is admitted in appellant's brief, and may be additionally verified by reference to Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the State of the Finances for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1915, p. 122; like report for the following fiscal year, p. 92.\n It was not erroneous for the Court of Claims to take note of the fact that, at the utmost, only a part of the claim could be paid in bonds or from the proceeds of bonds, and that with respect to any part not paid in this special manner there was no right to interest prior to the rendition of the judgment. This is the effect of the judgment as entered.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHEPARD v.

(b) That the order allowing an amendment as to the form of the appeal and the parties which was previously made without prejudice to the right of the appellees to object to the same at the hearing on the merits was rightfully granted and the objection which was at the hearing on the merits made by the appellees is without merit. (c) That under the case as made by the pleadings there is authority to review.\n The approach to the merits being thus cleared, without any difference on the subject the court is of opinion that the doctrines by which the case is controlled have been so affirmatively and conclusively settled by a prior decision of this court as to cause it to be unnecessary as a matter of original consideration to restate them.

JACKSON(1918)\nNo. 457\nArgued: Decided: April 15, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 388, 389]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. B. F. Harrah and Walter W. Warwick, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Joseph W. Bailey, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Congress provided for a district court of the Canal Zone, the appointment of a judge, and the salary attached to the office. Act of August 24, 1912, c. 390, 37 Stat. 565,  8 (Comp. St. 1916,  10044). In due course the salary fixed was definitely appropriated for. It is apparent that some controversy arose as to whether the Auditor of the Canal Zone had the power to refuse to give effect to the act of Congress fixing and appropriating the salary by withholding such sum as he might think was due from the judge as rent for quarters in property belonging to the United States in the Canal Zone. We say this is to be inferred, because in 1915 the Secretary of War submitted to the Attorney General two questions: First, whether the district judge was entitled to the same privilege as to quarters in the Canal Zone there enjoyed by other employes of the government; and second, if not, whether the Auditor had authority to deduct from the salary of the judge before paying it the sum which he considered due for rent of such quarters. Reversing the order in which the questions were asked, the Attorney General came first to reply to the second question and said:\n'... Without specific authority no portion of the salary of an officer of the United States may be withheld. See 20 Ops. 626 (1893); Benedict v. United States, \n176 U.S. 357\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 458 (1900). ...'\n\n While it is apparent that this ruling should have put the subject at rest, obviously the misconception of the \n\n[246 U.S. 388, 390]\n\u00a0\n Auditor as to the nature of his powers prevented that result from being accomplished and the Auditor refused to carry out the act of Congress and deducted from the salary of the judge, fixed by Congress, not only a charge for rent of quarters, but a sum which he considered due because of the absence of the judge from the Canal Zone during a certain period. The judge thereupon commenced the proceeding which is before us to compel the Auditor to perform his plain duty under the law and pay the salary without the deductions. As the result of the action of the Auditor and the necessity for bringing the suit, the expense was occasioned the United States of calling a judge from the United States to hear the cause and Judge Clayton of the Middle and Northern Districts of Alabama proceeded to the Canal Zone to discharge that duty. He did so, stating the reasons which controlled him in an elaborate and careful opinion making perfectly manifest the error of the action of the Auditor and his wrong in refusing to observe the ruling of the Attorney General in the premises. 241 Fed. 747, 154 C. C. A. 449. From the consequent judgment directing the payment of salary to be made without the deductions the Auditor prosecuted error to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in which court the judgment below was affirmed, and it is a further writ of error prosecuted by the Auditor from this court to that ruling which brings the subject- matter before us now.\n The expense of printing a voluminous record has been occasioned and the views of the Auditor have been pressed before us in a printed argument of more than one hundred pages. We think, however, that we need not follow or discuss that argument, as we are of opinion hat it is obvious on the face of the statement of the case that the Auditor had no power to refuse to carry out the law and that any doubt which he might have had should have been subordinated, first, to the ruling of the Attorney \n\n[246 U.S. 388, 391]\n\u00a0\n General and, second, beyond all possible question to the judgments of the courts below. It follows, therefore, that the prosecution of the writ of error from this court constituted a plain abuse by the Auditor of his administrative discretion. In an ordinary case the situation would be one not only justifying but making it our duty to direct the enforcement of Rule 23, (29 Sup. Ct. xix) as to damages. As, however, the judgment is not one for money but relates solely to the obligation to perform a manifest public duty, and plain as may have been the abuse of discretion committed, we are fain to believe it involved no intentional disregard of official duty, we pass that subject by and our order will be.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","144":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN PAC CO. v. LOWE(1918)\nNo. 452\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Gordon M. Buck, of New York City, for plaintiff in error. \n\n[247 U.S. 330, 331]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents a question arising under the Federal ncome Tax Act of October 3, 1913 (chapter 16, 38 Stat. 114, 166). Suit was brought by plaintiff in error against the collector to recover taxes assessed against it and paid under protest. There ware two causes of action, of which only the second went to trial, it having been stipulated that the trial of the other might be postponed until the final determination of this one. So far as it is presented to us, the suit is an effort to recover a tax imposed upon certain dividends upon stock, in form received by the plaintiff from another corporation in the early part of the year 1914, and alleged by the plaintiff to have been paid out of a surplus accumulated not only prior to the effective date of the act but prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The district court directed a verdict and judgment in favor of the collector (238 Fed. 847), and the case comes here by direct writ of error under section 238, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [ Comp. St. 1916,  1215]), because of the constitutional question. That our jurisdiction was properly invoked is settled by Towne v. Eisner, \n245 \nU.S. 418, 425\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 158, 62 L. Ed. --.\n The case was submitted at the same time with several other cases arising under the same act and decided this day, viz., Lynch, Collector, v. Turrish, \n247 U.S. 221\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 537, 62 L. Ed. --, Lynch, Collector, v. Hornby, by, \n247 U.S. 339\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 543, 62 L. Ed. --, and Peabody v. Eisner, Collector, \n247 U.S. 347\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 546, 62 L. Ed. --.\n The material facts are as follows: Prior to January 1, 1913, and at all times material to the case, plaintiff, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Kentucky owned all the capital stock of the Central Pacific Railway Company, a \n\n[247 U.S. 330, 332]\n\u00a0\n corporation of the state of Utah, including the stock registered in the names of the directors. \n1\n This situation existed continuously from the incorporation of the Railway Company in the year 1899. That company is the successor of the Central Pacific Railroad Company and acquired all of its properties, which constitute a part of a large system of railways owned or controlled by the Southern Pacific Company. The latter company, besides being sole stockholder, was in the actual physical possession of the railroads and all other assets of the Railway Company, and in charge of it operations, which were conducted in accordance with the terms of a lease made by the predecessor company to the Southern Pacific and assumed by the Railway Company, the effect of which was that the Southern Pacific should pay to the lessor company $10,000 per annum for organization expenses, should operate the railroads, branches, and leased lines belonging to the lessor, and account annually for the net earnings, and if these exceeded 6 per cent. on the existing capital stock of the lessor the lessee should retain to itself one-half of the excess; advances by the lessee for account of the lessor were to bear lawful interest, and the lessee was to be entitled at any time and from time to time to refund to itself its advances and interest out of any net earnings which might be in its hands. The provisions of the lease were observed by both corporations for bookkeeping purposes. The Southern Pacific acted as cashier and banker for the entire system; the Central Pacific kept no bank account, its earnings being deposited with the bank account of the Southern Pacific; and if the \n\n[247 U.S. 330, 333]\n\u00a0\n Central Pacific needed money for additions and betterments or for making up a deficit of current earnings, the necessary funds were advanced by the Southern Pacific. As a result of these operations and of the conversion of certain capital assets of the Central Pacific Company, that company showed upon its books a large surplus accumulated prior to January 1, 1913, principally in the form of a debit against the Southern Pacific, which at the same time, as sole stockholder, was entitled to any and all dividends that might be declared, and being in control of the board of directors was able to and did control the dividend policy. The dividends in question were declared and paid during the first six months of the year 1914 out of this surplus of the Central Pacific accumulated prior to January 1, 1913; but the payment was only constructive, being carried into effect by bookkeeping entries which simply reduced the apparent surplus of the Central Pacific and reduced the apparent indebtedness of the Southern Pacific to the Central Pacific by precisely the amount of the dividends.\n The question is whether the dividends received under these circumstances and in this manner by the Southern Pacific Company were taxable as income of that company under the Income Tax Act of 1913.2\n The act provides, in section 2, paragraph A, subdivision 1 (38 Stat. 166), 'that there shall be levied, assessed, collected and paid annually upon the entire net income arising or accruing from all sources in the preceding calendar year' to every person residing in the United States a tax of 1 per centum per annum, with exceptions not now \n\n[247 U.S. 330, 334]\n\u00a0\n material. By paragraph G (a), p. 172, it is provided 'that the normal tax hereinbefore imposed upon individuals [1 per cent.] likewise shall be levied, assessed, and paid annually upon the entire net income arising or accruing from all sources during the preceding calendar year to every corporation ... organized in the United States,' with other provisions not now material.\n It is provided in paragraph G (b), as to domestic corporations, that such net income shall be ascertained by deducting from the gross amount of the income of the corporation (1) ordinary and necessary expenses paid within the year in the maintenance and operation of its business and properties, including rentals and the like; (2) losses sustained within the year and not compensated by insurance or otherwise, including a reasonable allowance for depreciation by use, wear and tear of property, if any, and in the case of mines a certain allowance for depletion of ores and other natural deposits; (3) interest accrued and paid within the year upon indebtedness of the corporation, within prescribed limits; (4) national and state taxes paid. It will be observed that moneys received as dividends upon the stock of other corporations are not deducted, as they are in computing the income of individuals for the purpose of the normal tax under this act (page 167), and as they were in computing the income of a corporation under the Excise Tax Act of August 5, 1909 (chapter 6, 36 Stat. 11, 113,  38).\n By paragraph G(c), the tax upon corporations is to be computed upon the entire net income accrued within each calendar year, but for the year 1913 only upon the net income accrued from March 1 to December 31, to be ascertained by taking five-sixths of the entire net income for the calendar year.\n The purpose to refrain from taxing income that accrued prior to March 1, 1913, and to exclude from con- \n\n[247 U.S. 330, 335]\n\u00a0\n sideration in making the computation any income that accrued in a preceding calendar year, is made plain by the provision last referred to; indeed, the Sixteenth Amendment, under which for the first time Congress was authorized to tax income from property without apportioning the tax among the states according to population, received the approval of the requisite number of states only in February, 1913. Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429, 581\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 673; Id., \n158 \nU.S. 601, 637\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 912; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 236, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, L. R. A. 1917D, 414.\n We must reject in this case, as we have rejected in cases arising under the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909 (Doyle, Collector, v. Mitchell Brothers Co., \n247 U.S. 179\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 467, 62 L. Ed. --, and Hays, Collector, v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., \n247 U.S. 189\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 470, 62 L. Ed. --, decided May 20, 1918), the broad content on submitted in behalf of the government that all receipts-everything that comes in-are income within the proper definition of the term 'gross income,' and that the entire proceeds of a conversion of capital assets, in whatever form and under whatever circumstances accomplished, should be treated as gross income. Certainly the term 'income' has no broader meaning in the 1913 act than in that of 1909 (see Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 399, 416\n, 417 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 136), and for the present purpose we assume there is no difference in its meaning as used in the two acts. This being so, we are bound to consider accumulations that accrued to a corporation prior to January 1, 1913, as being capital, not income, for the purposes of the act. And we perceive no adequate ground for a distinction, in this regard, between an accumulation of surplus earnings, and the increment due to an appreciation in value of the assets of the taxpayer.\n That the dividends in question were paid out of a surplus that accrued to the Central Pacific prior to January 1, 1913, is undisputed; and we deem it to be equally clear that this surplus accrued to the Southern Pacific Company prior to that date, in every substantial sense \n\n[247 U.S. 330, 336]\n\u00a0\n pertinent to the present inquiry, and hence underwent nothing more than a change of form when the dividends were declared.\n We do not rest this upon the view that for the purposes of the act of 1913 stockholders in the ordinary case have the same interest in the accumulated earnings of the company before as after the declaration of dividends. The act is quite different in this respect from the Income Tax Act of June 30, 1864 (chapter 173, 13 Stat. 223, 281, 282), under which this court held, in Collector v. Hubbard, 12 Wall. 1, 16, that an individual was taxable upon his proportion of the earnings of the corporation although not declared as dividends. That decision was based upon the very special language of a clause of section 117 of the act (13 Stat. 282) that 'the gains and profits of all companies, whether incorporated or partnership, other than the companies specified in this section, shall be included in estimating the annual gains, profits, or income of any person entitled to the same, whether divided or otherwise.' The act of 1913 contains no similar language, but on the contrary deals with dividends as a particular item of income, leaving them free from the normal tax imposed upon individuals, subjecting them to the graduated surtaxes only when received as dividends (38 Stat. 167, paragraph B), and subjecting the interest of an individual shareholder in the undivided gains and profits of his corporation to these taxes only in case the company is formed or fraudulently availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of such tax by permitting gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed. \n3\n Our view of the effect of this act upon \n\n[247 U.S. 330, 337]\n\u00a0\n dividends received by the ordinary stockholder after it took effect but paid out of a surplus that accrued to the corporation before that event, is set forth in Lynch, Collector, v. Hornby, \n247 U.S. 339\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 543, 62 L. Ed. --, decided this day.\n We base our conclusion in the present case upon the view that it was the purpose and intent of Congress, while taxing 'the entire net income arising or accruing from all sources' during each year commencing with the 1st day of March, 1913, to refrain from taxing that which, in mere form only, bore the appearance of income accruing after that date, while in truth and in substance it accrued before; and upon the fact that the Central Pacific and the Southern Pacific were in substance identical because of the complete ownership and control which the latter possessed over the former, as stockholder and in other capacities. While the two companies were separate legal entities, yet in fact, and for all practical purposes they were merged, the former being but a part of the latter, acting merely as its agent and subject in all things to its proper direction and control. And, besides, the funds represented by the dividends were in the actual possession and control of the Southern Pacific as well before as after the declaration of the dividends. The fact that the books were kept in accordance with the provisions of the lease, so that these funds appeared upon \n\n[247 U.S. 330, 338]\n\u00a0\n the accounts as an indebtedness of the lessee to the lessor, cannot be controlling, in view of the practical identity between lessor and lessee. Aside from the interests of creditors and the public-and there is nothing to suggest that the interests of either were concerned in the disposition of the surplus of the Central Pacific-the Southern Pacific was entitled to dispose of the matter as it saw fit. There is no question of there being a surplus to warrant the dividends at the time they were made, hence any speculation as to what might have happened in case of financial reverses that did not occur is beside the mark.\n It is true that in ordinary cases the mere accumulation of an adequate surplus does not entitle a stockholder to dividends until the directors in their discretion declare them. New York, etc., Railroad v. Nickals, \n119 \nU.S. 296, 306\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 209; Gibbons v. Mahon, \n136 \nU.S. 549, 558\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 1057. And see Humphreys v. McKissock, \n140 \nU.S. 304, 312\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 779. But this is not the ordinary case. In fact the discretion of the directors was affirmatively exercised by declaring dividends out of the surplus that was accumulated prior to January 1, 1913; it does not appear that any other fair exercise of discretion was open; and the complete ownership and right of control of the Southern Pacific at all times material makes it a matter of indifference whether the vote was at one time or another. Under the circumstances, the entire matter of the declaration and payment of the dividends was a paper transaction to bring the books into accord with the acknowledged rights of the Southern Pacific; and so far as the dividends represented the surplus of the Central Pacific that accumulated prior to January 1, 1913, they were not taxable as income of the Southern Pacific within the true intent and meaning of the act of 1913\n\n\n The case turns upon its very peculiar facts, and is distinguishable from others in which the question of the identity of a controlling stockholder with his corporation has been \n\n[247 U.S. 330, 339]\n\u00a0\n raised. Pullman Car. Co. v. Missouri Pacific Co., \n115 \nU.S. 587, 596\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 194; Peterson v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry ., \n205 \nU.S. 364, 391\n, 27 S. Sup.

As to this, however, no argument is submitted by plaintiff in error, the facts are not clear, and we pass it without consideration. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'For the purpose of this additional tax the taxable income of any individual shall embrace the share to which he would be entitled of the gains and profits, if divided or distributed, whether divided or distributed or not, of all corporations, joint-stock companies, or associations however created or organized, formed or fraudulently availed or for the purpose of preventing the imposition of such tax through the medium of permitting such gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed; and the fact that any such corporation ... is a mere holding company, or that the gains and profits are permitted to accumulate eyond the reasonable needs of the business shall be prima facie evidence of a fraudulent purpose to escape such tax; but the fact that the gains and profits are in any case permitted to accumulate and become surplus shall not be construed as evidence of a purpose to escape the said tax in such case unless the Secretary of the Treasury shall certify that in his opinion such accumulation is unreasonable for the purposes of the business.' 38 Stat. 166, 167. \n\n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN PAC CO. v.

The cause was submitted on a motion to dismiss, which was sustained. The printed record did not contain the proceedings upon the application to remove the cause from the state court. The briefs of counsel upon both sides, upon which the case was submitted, stated that the case was removed because of diversity of citizenship. Treating these statements as the equivalent of a stipulation the court decided the case and rendered judgment.

The Interstate Commerce Commission had found the rate to be excessive and had made an order for reduction from 85 to 75 cents, which was obeyed, and also one for reparation to the extent of the excess, which was not obeyed. 13 Interst. Com. Com'n, 668. A demurrer to the declaration was sustained by the Circuit Court on the ground that it was not alleged that the plaintiffs had paid the excessive rates or that they were damaged thereby. 190 Fed. 659. The declaration was amended, but at the trial the judge directed a verdict for the defendants, presumably on the ground argued here, that it did not appear that the plaintiffs were damaged. The judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 221 Fed. 890, 137 C. C. A. 460. At a new trial the jury were instructed that if they found the rate charged unreasonable and that prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission reasonable, they should find for the plaintiffs in accordance with the Commission's award. The jury found for the plaintiffs and this judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 229 Fed. 1022, 143 C. C. A. 663.\n The only question before us is that at which we have hinted: whether the fact that the plaintiffs were able to pass on the damage that they sustained in the first instance by paying the unreasonable charge, and to collect that amount from the purchasers, prevents their recovering the verpayment from the carriers. The answer is not difficult. The general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step. As it does not attribute remote consequences to a defendant so it holds him liable if proximately \n\n[245 U.S. 531, 534]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiff has suffered a loss. The plaintiffs suffered losses to the amount of the verdict when they paid. Their claim accrued at once in the theory of the law and it does not inquire into later events. Olds v. Mapes- Reeve Construction Co., 177 Mass. 41, 44, 58 N. E. 478. Perhaps strictly the securing of such an indemnity as the present might be regarded as not differing in principle from the recovery of insurance, as res inter alios, with which the defendants were not concerned. If it be said that the whole transaction is one from a business point of view, it is enough to reply that the unity in this case is not sufficient to entitle the purchaser to recover, any more than the ultimate consumer who in turn paid an increased price. He has no privity with the carrier. State v. Central Vermont Ry. Co ., 81 Vt. 459, 71 Atl. 193, 21 L. R. A. (N. S.) 949. See Nicola, Stone & Myers Co. v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., 14 Interst. Com. Com'n, 199, 207-209; Baker Manufacturing Co. v. Chicago Northwestern Ry. Co., 21 Interst. Com. Com'n, 605. The carrier ought not to be allowed to retain his illegal profit, and the only one who can take it from him is the one that alone was in relation with him, and from whom the carrier took the sum. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. Ballou & Wright, 242 Fed. 862, 155 C. C. A. 450. Behind the technical mode of statement is the consideration well emphasized by the Interstate Commerce Commission, of the endlessness and futility of the effort to follow every transaction to its ultimate result. 13 Interst. Com. Com'n, 680. Probably in the end the public pays the damages in most cases of compensated torts.\n The cases like Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co ., \n230 U.S. 184\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 893, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 315, where a party that has paid only the reasonable rate sues upon a discrimination because some other has paid less, are not like the present. There the damage depends upon remoter considerations. But here the plaintiffs have paid cash out of pocket that should not have been required of them, \n\n[245 U.S. 531, 535]\n\u00a0\n and there is no question as to the amount of the proximate loss.

CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO(1918)\nNo. 211\nArgued: March 19, 1918Decided: April 15, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 391, 392]\n\u00a0\n In 1908 the Spring Valley Water Company, the appellant, commenced in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of California a suit against the City and County of San Francisco to enjoin the enforcement of an ordinance fixing the water rates for that year. A preliminary injunction was granted upon the condition that all sums collected by the Water Company from its customers in excess of the ordinance rates should be deposited in a bank agreed upon by the parties or designated by the court to await the outcome of the litigation. The sums so collected, it was provided, should be received by the bank as a special deposit subject to the order of the court and should be paid out on checks drawn by a special master and countersigned by a judge of the court. Pursuant to a stipulation of the parties the court subsequently designated the Mercantile Trust Company of San Francisco as the depository for the impounded moneys and ordered that the account should be entitled 'Spring Valley Water Company-Special Account' and should bear two per cent. interest per annum. Each year following down to 1913 the Water Company brought a similar suit to enjoin the ordinance fixing water rates for the respective year. In four of these five cases a preliminary injunction was granted upon the same condition expressed in the preliminary injunction awarded in the 1908 suit. In the fifth, although a preliminary injunction was granted, no order was made concerning the impounding of sums collected in excess of the ordinance rates, but the parties stipulated that the moneys collected during the year embraced by that suit should also be deposited in the bank designated by the court to await the final outcome of the case. Pursuant to these orders and stipulations the Water Company made deposits of the moneys in the Mercantile Trust Company of San Francisco and from time to time the court, to safeguard the funds, ordered portions of it \n\n[246 U.S. 391, 393]\n\u00a0\n transferred from that bank to six other banks in San Francisco. The money thus transferred and deposited in the six banks was placed in special accounts subject to the order of the court, to be withdrawn only by check signed by the special master and countersigned by a judge of the court.\n The moneys on deposit in each of the seven banks on the first Mondays in March, 1913 and 1914, were by the local officer assessed for taxation for those years. In each assessment the bank was described as 'Receiver of Impounded Moneys' and 'Receiver or Depository under Order of Court of the Impounded Moneys in Equity Suits numbered 14275, 14735, 14892, 15131, 15569, 15344 and 26, District Court of the United States, wherein the Spring Valley Water Company is plaintiff and City and County of San Francisco et al., defendants.' With the exception of No. 14275 (which was a suit begun in 1907 to enjoin the water rates of that year and in which the court made no order concerning the impounding of funds and no deposits were made by the Water Company) the suits referred to are those which we have previously mentioned. On application of the tax collector of the City and County of San Francisco the District Court of the United States after notice and a hearing directed the payment of the taxes. As there were two assessments against each of the seven banks, the court issued fourteen orders and to reverse the decrees of the court below affirming the action of the trial court fourteen appeals are prosecuted. 225 Fed. 728, 140 C. C. A. 209. While the order under review on this record concerned the assessment of moneys in the possession of the Mercantile Trust Company of San Francisco in March, 1913, and directed the payment of taxes in the sum of $8,479.89, there is a stipulation that the appeals in the other thirteen cases (numbers 212 to 224) are to be determined by the decision in this. \n\n[246 U.S. 391, 394]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ira A. Campbell, Edward J. McCutchen, and A. Crawford Greene, all of San Francisco, Cal., and Alex Britton and Evans Browne, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Messrs. Robert M. Searles, and Percy V. Long, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees,\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The sole ground urged for reversal is the invalidity of the assessment (a) because it was not authorized by any statute of the state, and (b) because it did not contain a sufficient description of the property assessed, and we come to consider these objections under two headings.\n\n 1. \nThat the assessment was authorized by the following section of the Political Code of California we think is clear:\n'Section 3647. Property and money in litigation. Money and property in litigation in possession of a county treasurer, of a court, county clerk, or receiver, must be assessed to such treasurer, clerk, or receiver, and the taxes be paid thereon under the direction of the court.'\n\n Without following and directly answering the argument advanced to sustain the contrary view, we content ourselves with a summary statement of the reasons for our conclusion. Words cannot make clearer than does the language of the text the purpose of the section to tax property or money in litigation in the hands of a court. Indeed the Supreme Court of California has so construed the section. Los Angeles v. Los Angeles City Water Co., 137 Cal. 699, 70 Pac. 770; Bessolo v. City of Los Angeles, 169 Pac. (Cal.) 372. It is further manifest that the taxation of the money deposited in the injunction suits was what was sought to be accomplished by the assessment which was made. The money assessed was in litigation, \n\n[246 U.S. 391, 395]\n\u00a0\n was in the custody of the court and was by its direction placed in the bank in a special account subject to the control of the court. Moreover the assessment to the bank which held the money for the court was a direct compliance with the terms of the section, the description 'receiver' being employed in the statute not in a technical sense but as embracing any person acting as agent or depository of funds for a court. To give to the word the narrower meaning contended for would defeat the obvious and adjudged purpose of the statute.\n\n\n (b)\n It is contended that the assessment was invalid for want of sufficient description of the property assessed, first, because the assessment purported to assess moneys impounded in the 1907 injunction suit, No. 14275, when as we have seen no money was in fact deposited in that suit, and second, because the assessment did not separately assess the moneys impounded in each of the six suits but assessed as a unit all the moneys impounded in all the suits.\n As to the first, it is apparent that the inclusion of the 1907 suit, No. 14275, could not operate to assess moneys which had no existence and hence the reference to that suit is wholly negli ible. As to the second, the assessment referred to the cases by mumber and designated the court in which they were pending as well as the parties. The court in exercising its jurisdiction over the moneys had specifically directed their deposit to special accounts in each suit separately, thus enabling it at the termination of the litigation to distribute the funds after apportioning the sum of the tax chargeable to each. It is thus clear that not only was there no want of definiteness in the description of the property but no possible detriment to the Water Company could in any event arise because of the method of assessment which was followed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","148":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTADELMAN v.

O. L.  1252- 1270), the \n\n[246 U.S. 544, 545]\n\u00a0\n administrator shall file a petition therefor, and that a citation shall issue to heirs known and unknown 'to appear at a term of court therein mentioned, not less than ten days after the service of such citation, to show cause, if any exist, why an order of sale should not be made as in the petition prayed for.' Section 1254. The statutes also provide for the service of unknown or nonresident heirs by publication for 'not less than four weeks, or for such further time as the court or judge may prescribe.' Section 1255\n\n\n In 1897 Charles W. Fletcher died intestate in Oregon. His administrator filed in the county court a petition for the sale of the decedent's real estate in order to pay debts; and the citation was ordered to be served upon the unknown or nonresident heirs by publication in a newspaper for four weeks. Publication was made in conformity to the order, the first publication being on June 17, 1902. Under the statute, the state court finds that the hearing on the petition should not have been held before July 24th. It was actually held on July 17th; and an order of sale was then entered by the county court under which the property was sold to Nelson, through whom Miner and Worden claim title by mesne conveyances. The deceased had left surviving two children who were nonresidents, Mrs. Stadelman and Henry H. Fletcher. Thereafter, these two and one Motley (a grantee from them of a part interest in the property) brought, in an appropriate state court of Oregon, an independent suit to quiet title and claimed to own the property on the ground that the order of the county court and the sale to Nelson thereunder were void. A decree was rendered by the trial court in their favor; and it was affirmed on appeal by the Supreme Court of the state, where two curative acts were unsuccessfully invoked to sustain the validity of the Miner and Worden title. 83 Or. 348, 355, 155 Pac. 708, 163 Pac. 585, 983.

It held that failure to observe the statutory requirement as to time for hearing was a defect rendering the order voidable merely and not void; that the defect did not operate to deprive the county court of jurisdiction; that the defects could have been availed of only in a direct attack; and that it afforded no basis for a collateral attack, in an independent suit, upon the order and the sale thereunder. 83 Or. 379, 155 Pac. 708, 163 Pac. 585, 983. This conclusion was confirmed by the same court upon a second petition for a rehearing. 83 Or. 388, 155 Pac. 708, 163 Pac. 585, 983.\n At the first argument of the case in the Supreme Court of Oregon, plaintiffs contended that to sustain the validity of the sale under the order of the county court would deprive them of their right to due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.

But under that section, as amended by Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448,  2, 39 Stat. 726 (Comp. St. 1916,  1214), a final decree of a state court of last resort can be reviewed here on writ of error only in a suit 'where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against their validity, or where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of their validity.' The judgment here involved was entered after the act of September 6, 1916, took effect. There was not drawn in question the validity of any treaty or statute.

STATE OF TENN.(1918)\nNo. 37\nArgued: October 9, 1917Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 158, 160]\n\u00a0\n This is an original suit in equity brought by the State of Arkansas against the State of Tennessee for the purpose of determining the location of the boundary line between those States along that portion of the bed of the Mississippi river that was left dry as the result of an avulsion which occurred March 7, 1876, when a new channel was formed known as the 'Centennial Cut-Off.'\n The cause, having been put at issue by the filing of answer and replication, was brought on to hearing upon stipulated facts, pursuant to an intimation made by this court is Cissna v. Tennessee, \n242 \nU.S. 195, 198\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 108.\n The facts are as follows: By the Treaty of 1763 between England, France, and Spain, Art. VII (3 Jenkinson's Treaties, 177, 182), the boundary line between the British and French possessions at this place was established as 'a line drawn along the middle of the River Mississippi,' with consequent recognition of the dominion of France over the territory now comprising the State of Arkansas, and the dominion of Great Britain over that now comprising the State of Tennessee. By the Treaty of Peace concluded between the United States and Great Britain, September 3, 1783 ( 8 Stat. 80), the territory comprising Tennessee passed to the United States, its westerly boundary being described (Art. II) as 'a line to be drawn along the middle of the said River Mississippi.' It formed a part of the State of North Carolina. In the year 1790 North Carolina ceded it to the United States (Act of April 2, 1790, ch. 6, 1 Stat. 106). In the report made in the following year by Thomas Jefferson, then Secretary of State, and submitted to Congress by President Washington, the bounds of the ceded territory were described, the western boundary being 'the middle of the \n\n[246 U.S. 158, 161]\n\u00a0\n River Mississippi.' 1 American State Papers, Public Lands, p. 17. And by Act of June 1, 1796 (ch. 47, 1 Stat. 491), the whole of the territory thus ceded was made a State. By the Louisiana Purchase, under the Treaty of April 30, 1803 (8 Stat. 200), the territory comprising Arkansas was acquired by the United States from France. It was admitted into the Union as a State by Act of June 15, 1836 (ch. 100, 5 Stat. 50), its easterly boundary being escribed as 'the middle of the main channel of the said river.'\n According to the stipulated facts, the earliest evidence concerning the location of the river at the place in question relates to the year 1823, and is set forth upon a map made recently by Major Humphreys, purporting to show the conditions as they existed at that time. The river flowed southward past Dean's Island on the Arkansas side, made a bend to the westward at or about the southernmost part of this island, and then swept northerly and westerly around Island No. 37 (Tennessee), a lesser channel known as McKenzie Chute passing between that island and the main Tennessee shore; the main and lesser channels met at the southwestern extremity of Island No. 37, and the river flowed thence southwesterly past Point Able, Tennessee, opposite which it turned again easterly and then northerly, forming what is known as the Devil's Elbow, and flowed thence easterly or northeasterly around Brandywine Point or Island (Arkansas), until it came within a distance of about two miles from the place where it started its northerly turn opposite Dean's Island; and at this point it turned again to the southward. It is agreed that in 1823 the river ran substantially as indicated upon the Humphreys map, and that between that year and the year 1876 the width of the channel, by erosion and caving in of the Tennessee bank south, southwest, and west of Dean's Island, along the mainland and Island No. 37, had increased from its former width of about a \n\n[246 U.S. 158, 162]\n\u00a0\n mile or less to a width of 1 1\/4 or 1 1\/2 miles, with consequent narrowing of the neck of land opposite Dean's Island. It is a matter in controversy between the parties whether during the same period there were accretions to Dean's Island and Plum Island, in the State of Arkansas, and to Island No. 37 and the shore below Point Able, on the Tennessee side. A steamboat reconnaissance of the river was made by Colonel Suter under the direction of the War Department in 1874, and a map of the place in question was prepared under his direction and is in evidence. There being no proof of material changes in the river between 1874 and 1876, this map, while not shown to be entirely accurate, is agreed to represent the general situation as it existed in the latter year.\n On March 7, 1876, the river suddenly and with great violence, within about thirty hours, made for itself a new channel directly across the neck opposite the apex of Dean's Island, so that the old channel around the bend of the elbow (a distance of fifteen to twenty miles) was abandoned by the current, and although it remained for a few years covered with dead water it was no longer navigable except in times of high water for small boats, and this continued only for a short time, since the old bed immediately began to fill with sand, sediment, and alluvial deposits. In the course of time it became dry land suitable for cultivation and to a considerable extent covered with timber. The new channel is called, from the year in which it originated, the 'Centennial Cut-Off,' and the land that it separated from the Tennessee mainland goes by the name of 'Centennial Island.'\n The cut-off and the territory affected by it are the same that are mentioned and dealt with in the cases of Stockley v. Cissna, 119 Fed. 812, 56 C. C. A. 324, State v. Pulp Co., 119 Tenn. 47, 104 S. W. 437, and Stockley v. Cissna, 119 Tenn. 135, 104 S. W. 792. The State of Tennessee, in her answer, pleads and relies upon the first and second of these cases as judicial \n\n[246 U.S. 158, 163]\n\u00a0\n determinations and evidence of the boundary line between the States at the place in question. Their materiality and effect are matters to be determined.\n Prior to 1876, notably around 'Island 37' and 'Devil's Elbow,' the bank on one side of the river was high and subject to erosion, the effect of the water against it; while on the opposite side the bank was a fiat or sloping shore, so that the width of the river was materially affected by the rise and fall of the water, being considerably wider at normal than at low-water stage.\n The following questions are submitted for the determination of this court:\n\n\n (1)\n Arkansas contends that the true boundary line between the States ( aside from the question of the avulsion of 1876) is the middle of the river at low water, that is, the middle of the channel of navigation; whereas Tennessee contends that the true boundary is a line equidistant from the well-defined banks at a normal stage of the river.\n\n\n (2)\n Arkansas contends that by the avulsion of 1876 the boundary line between the States was unaffected, and remained in the middle of the river bed which was by the avulsion abandoned, whether the first or the second definition of the middle of the river be adopted; whereas Tennessee contends that the line was affected by the avulsion to the extent indicated by the opinion of the Supreme Court of that State in State v. Pulp Co., 119 Tenn. 47, 104 S. W. 437; that is, that the effect of the avulsion was to press back the line between the two States to the middle of the old channel as it ran previous to the erosions upon the Tennessee banks that occurred between 1823 and 1876\n\n\n\n\n (3)\n Tennessee contends that, irrespective of the question of accretions and erosions, it is impossible now to locate accurately the line of the river as it ran in 1876 just prior to the avulsion, and that therefore the line of 1823 \n\n[246 U.S. 158, 164]\n\u00a0\n must prevail as the boundary line between the States, where it has been or can be located accurately and definitely; whereas Arkansas insists that there is no real difficulty in locating the middle of the river in 1876.\n Upon the determination of these points, the court is to appoint a commission to run, locate, and designate the line.\n Mr. Caruthers Ewing, of Memphis, Tenn., for the State of Arkansas.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 158, 166]\n\u00a0\n Mr. G. T. Fitzhugh, of Memphis, Tenn., for the State of Tennessee.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 158, 169]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court,\n Concerning the proper location of an interstate boundary line with reference to the shores and channel of a navigable river separating one State of the Union from another, much has been written. The subject was brought under the consideration of this court in Iowa v. Illinois, \n147 U.S. 1\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 239. In that case, Illinois contended that the boundary followed the middle of the channel of commerce, that is, the channel commonly used by steamboats and other craft navigating the river; while on the part of Iowa it was insisted that the line ran in the middle of the main body of the river, taking the middle line between its banks or shores, irrespective of where the channel of commerce might be, and that the measurements must be taken at ordinary stage of water. The contention of each State was supported by a decision of its court of last resort: Dunlieth & Dubuque Bridge Co. v. County of Dubuque, 55 Iowa, 558, 565, 8 N. W. 443; Buttenuth v. St. Louis Bridge Co., 123 Ill. 535, 548, 17 N. E. 439, 5 Am. St. Rep. 545. This court recognized these cases as presenting in the clearest terms the different views as to the line of jurisdiction between neighboring States separated by a navigable stream, and thereupon proceeded to analyze their reasoning and doctrine. From a review of the authorities upon international law, it was declared that when a navigable river constituted the boundary between two independent States the interest of each State in the navigation, and the preservation by each of its equal right in such navigation, required that the middle of the channel should mark the boundary up to which each State on its side should exercise jurisdiction; that hence, in international law, and by the usage of European \n\n[246 U.S. 158, 170]\n\u00a0\n nations, the term 'middle of the stream,' as applied to a navigable river, meant the middle of the channel of such stream, and that in this sense the terms were used in the treaty between Great Britain, France, and Spain, concluded at Paris in 1763, so that by the language 'a line drawn along the middle of the River Mississippi,' as there sed, the middle of the channel was indicated; that the thalweg, or middle of the navigable channel, is to be taken as the true boundary line between independent States for reasons growing out of the right of navigation, in the absence of a special convention between the States or long use equivalent thereto; and that although the reason and necessity of the rule may not be as cogent in this country, where neighboring States are under the same general government, yet the same rule must be held to obtain unless changed by statute or usage of so great a length of time as to have acquired the force of law; and that the Illinois Enabling Act of April 18, 1818 (3 Stat. 428, ch. 67,  2), which made 'the middle of the Mississippi river' the western boundary of the State, the Missouri Enabling Act of March 6, 1820 (3 Stat. 545, ch. 22,  2), which adopted 'the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi river' as the eastern boundary of that State, and the Wisconsin Enabling Act of August 6, 1846 (9 Stat. 56, ch. 89), which referred to 'the center of the main channel of that river,' employed these varying phrases as signifying the same thing. Hence we reached the conclusion (147 U. S. p. 13, 13 Sup. Ct. 239) that as between the different views as to the line of jurisdiction between neighboring States, separated by a navigable stream, the controlling consideration 'is that which preserves to each State equality in the right of navigation in the river.' It was accordingly adjudged and declared that the boundary line between the contesting States was 'the middle of the main navigable channel of the Mississippi river'; and a final decree to that effect was afterwards made. \n202 U.S. 59\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 571. \n\n[246 U.S. 158, 171]\n\u00a0\n The rule thus adopted, known as the rule of the 'thalweg,' has been treated as set at rest by that decision. Louisiana v. Mississippi, \n202 \nU.S. 1, 49\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 408, 571; Washington v. Oregon, \n211 \nU.S. 127, 134\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 47; \n214 \nU.S. 205, 215\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 631. The argument submitted in behalf of the defendant State in the case at bar, including a reference to the notable recent decision of its Supreme Court in State v. Pulp Co. (1907) 119 Tenn. 47, 104 S. W. 437, has failed to convince us that this rule ought now, after the lapse of twenty-five years, to be departed from.\n It is said that Arkansas has interpreted the line to be at a point equidistant from the well-defined and permanent banks of the river, that Tennessee likewise has recognized this boundary, and that by long acquiescence on the part of both States in this construction, and the exercise of jurisdiction by both in accordance therewith, the question should be treated as settled. The reference is to certain judicial decisions, and two acts of legislation. In Cessill v. State (1883) 40 Ark. 501, which was a prosecution for unlicensed sale of liquors upon a boat anchored off the Arkansas shore, it was held that the boundary line, as established by the original treaties and since observed in federal legislation, state constitutions, and judicial decisions was the 'line along the river bed equidistant from the permanent and defined banks of the ascertained channel on either side.' This was followed in subsequent decisions by the same court. Wolfe v. State (1912) 104 Ark. 140, 143, 148 S. W. 641; Kinnanne v. State (1913) 106 Ark. 286, 290, 153 S. W. 262. The first pertinent decision by the Supreme Court of Tennessee is State v. Pulp Co. (1907) 119 Tenn. 47, 104 S. W. 437, in which a similar conclusion was reached, partly upon the ground that it had been adopted by the courts of Arkansas. The legislative action referred to consists of two acts of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee (Acts 1903, p. 1215, ch. 420; Acts 1907, p. 1723, ch. 516), each of which authorized the \n\n[246 U.S. 158, 172]\n\u00a0\n appointment of a commission to confer and act with a like commission representing the State of Arkansas to locate the line between the States in the old and abandoned ch nnel at the place that we now have under consideration; and the Act of 1907 further provided that if Arkansas should fail to appoint a commission, the Attorney General of Tennessee should be authorized to institute a suit against that State in this court to establish and locate the boundary line. These acts, far from treating the boundary as a line settled and acquiesced in, treat it as a matter requiring to be definitely settled, with the co-operation of representatives of the sister State if practicable, otherwise by appropriate litigation.\n The Arkansas decisions had for their object the establishment of a proper rule for the administration of the criminal laws of the State, and were entirely independent of any action taken or proposed by the authorities of the State of Tennessee. They had no particular reference to that part of the river bed that was abandoned as the result of the avulsion of 1876; on the contrary, they dealt with parts of the river where the water still flowed in its ancient channel. The decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee in State v. Pulp Co., 119 Tenn. 47, 104 S. W. 437, sustained the claim of the State to a part of the abandoned river bed which, by the rule of the thalweg, would be without that State. The combined effect of these decisions and of the legislation referred to, all of which were subsequent to the year 1876, falls far short of that long acquiescence in the practical location of a common boundary, and possession in accordance therewith, which in some of the cases has been treated as an aid in setting the question at rest. Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 4 How. 591, 638, 639; Indiana v. Kentucky, \n136 \nU.S. 479, 510\n, 514 S., 518, 10 Sup. Ct. 1051; Virginia v. Tennessee, \n148 \nU.S. 503, 522\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 728; Louisiana v. Mississippi, \n202 \nU.S. 1, 53\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 408, 571; Maryland v. West Virginia, \n217 \nU.S. 1, 41\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 268. \n\n[246 U.S. 158, 173]\n\u00a0\n Therefore we find it unnecessary to decide whether the supposed agreement between the States respecting the boundary would be valid without the consent of Congress, in view of the third clause of section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States.\n The next and perhaps the most important question is as to the effect of the sudden and violent change in the channel of the river that occurred in the year 1876, and which both parties properly treat as a true and typical avulsion. It is settled beyond the possibility of dispute that where running streams are the boundaries between States, the same rule applies as between private proprietors, namely, that when the bed and channel are changed by the natural and gradual processes known as erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the varying course of the stream; while if the stream from any cause, natural or artificial, suddenly leaves its old bed and forms a new one, by the process known as an avulsion, the resulting change of channel works no change of boundary, which remains in the middle of the old channel, although no water may be flowing in it, and irrespective of subsequent changes in the new channel. New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662, 717; Jefferis v. East Omaha Land Co., \n134 \nU.S. 178, 189\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 518; Nebraska v. Iowa, \n143 \nU.S. 359, 361\n, 367 S., 370, 12 Sup. Ct. 396; Missouri v. Nebraska, \n196 U.S. 23\n, 34-36, 25 Sup. Ct. 155.\n There is controversy with respect to the application of the foregoing rule to the particular circumstances of this case. It is insisted in behalf of the State of Tennessee that since the rule of the thalweg derives its origin from the equal rights of the respective States in the navigation of the river, the reason for the rule and therefore the rule itself ceases when navigation has been rendered impossible by the abandonment of a portion of the river bed as the result of an avulsion. In support of this contention we are referred to some expressions of Vattel, Almeda, M ore, and other writers; but we deem theminconclusive, \n\n[246 U.S. 158, 174]\n\u00a0\n and are of the opinion, on the contrary, that the contention runs counter to the settled rule and is inconsistent with the declarations of this court, in Nebraska v. Iowa, \n143 \nU.S. 359, 367\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 396, 399 (36 L. Ed. 186), that 'avulsion would establish a fixed boundary, to wit: the center of the abandoned channel,' or, as it is expressed on page 370 of 143 U. S., on page 400 of 12 Sup. Ct. (36 L. Ed. 186), 'the boundary was not changed, and it remained as it was prior to the avulsion, the center line of the old channel,' and in Missouri v. Nebraska, \n196 \nU.S. 23, 36\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 155, 158 (49 L. Ed. 372) that the boundary line 'must be taken to be the middle of the channel of the river as it was prior to such avulsion.'\n It is contended, further, that since the avulsion of 1876 caused the old river bed to dry up, what is called 'the doctrine of the submergence and reappearance of land' must be applied, so as to establish the ancient boundary as it existed at the time of the earliest record, in this case the year 1823, with the effect of eliminating any shifting of the river bed that resulted from the erosions and accretions of the half century preceding the avulsion.\n This contention is rested chiefly upon a quotation from Sir Matthew Hale, De Jure Maris, chap. 4:\n'If a subject hath land adjoining the sea, and the violence of the sea swallow it up, but so that yet there be reasonable marks to continue the notice of it; or though the marks be defaced; yet if by situation and extent of quantity, and bounding upon the firm land, the same can be known, though the sea leave this land again, or it be by art or industry regained, the subject doth not lose his propriety; and accordingly it was held by Cooke and Foster, M. 7 Jac. C. B., though the inundation continue forty years.' 1 Hargraves' Law Tracts, 15; Note to Ex parte Jennings, 6 Cow. (N. Y.) 542, 16 Am. Dec. 447.\n\n To the same effect, 2 Roll. Abr. 168, 1. 48; 6 Comyns' Dig., tit. Prerogative, D. 61, 62; 5 Bacon's Abr., tit. Prerogative, B. 1. A reference to the context shows that the portion quoted is a statement of one of several exceptions to the general rule that any increase \n\n[246 U.S. 158, 175]\n\u00a0\n of land per relictionem, or sudden recession of the sea, belonged of common right to the King as a part of his prerogative. It amounts to no more than saying that where the reliction did but restore that which before had been private property and had been lost through the violence of the sea, the private right should be restored if the land is capable of identification. Such a case was Mulry v. Norton, 100 N. Y. 424, 3 N. E. 581, 53 Am. Rep. 206, the true scope of which decision was pointed out in In re City of Buffalo, 206 N. Y. 319, 326, 327, 99 N. E. 850. But this doctrine has no proper bearing upon the rule we have stated with reference to boundary streams. Certainly it cannot be regarded as having the effect of carving out an exception to the rule that where the course of the stream changes through the operation of the natural and gradual processes of erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the stream; while if the stream leaves its former bed and establishes a new one as the result of an avulsion, the boundary remains in the middle of the former channel. An avulsion has this effect, whether it results in the drying up of the old channel or not. So long as that channel remains a running stream, the boundary marked by it is still subject to be changed by erosion and accretion; but when the water becomes stagnant, the effect of these processes is at an end; the boundary then becomes fixed in the middle of the channel as we have defined it, and the gradual filling up of the bed that ensues is not to be treated as an accretion to the shores but as an ultimate effect of the avulsion. The emergence of the land, however, may or may not follow, and it ought not in reason to have any controlling effect upon the location of the boundary line in the old channel. To give to it such an effect is we think, to misapply the rule quoted from Sir Matthew Hale.\n How the land that emerges on either side of an interstate boundary stream shall be disposed of as between public and private ownership is a matter to be determined \n\n[246 U.S. 158, 176]\n\u00a0\n according to the law of each State, under the familiar doctrine that it is for the States to establish for themselves such rules of property as they deem expedient with respect to the navigable waters within their borders and the riparian lands adjacent to them.

Sup. Ct. 242, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 107. Thus Arkansas may limit riparian ownership by the ordinary high-water mark (Railway v. Ramsey, 53 Ark. 314, 323, 13 S. W. 931, 8 L. R. A. 559, 22 Am. St. Rep. 195; Wallace v. Driver, 61 Ark. 429, 435, 436, 33 S. W. 641, 31 L. R. A. 317); and Tennessee, while extending riparian ownership upon navigable streams to ordinary low-water mark, and reserving as public the lands constituting the bed below that mark (Elder v. Burrus, 25 Tenn. [6 Humph.] 358, 368; Martin v. Nance, 40 Tenn. [3 Head] 649, 650; Goodwin v. Thompson, 83 Tenn. [15 Lea] 209, 54 Am. Rep. 410), may, in the case of an avulsion followed by a drying up of the old channel of the river, recognize the right of former riparian owners to be restored to that which they have lost through gradual erosions in times preceding the avulsion, as she has done in State v. Pulp Co., 119 Tenn. 47, 104 S. W. 437. But these dispositions are in each case limited by the interstate boundary, and cannot be permitted to press back the boundary line from where otherwise it should be located.\n It is hardly necessary to say that State v. Pulp Co., supra, and Stockley v. Cissna, 119 Fed. 812, 56 C. C. A. 324, relied upon in defendant's answer as judicial determinations of the boundary line, can have no such effect against the State of Arkansas, which was a stranger to the record in both cases.\n Upon the whole case we conclude that the questions submitted for our determination are to be answered as follows: \n\n[246 U.S. 158, 177]\n\u00a0\n (1) The true boundary line between the States, aside from the question of the avulsion of 1876, is the middle of the main channel of navigation as it existed at the Treaty of Peace concluded between the United States and Great Britain in 1783, subject to such changes as have occurred since that time through natural and gradual processes.\n\n\n (2)\n By the avulsion of 1876 the boundary line between the States was unaffected, and remained in the middle of the former main channel of navigation, as above defined.\n\n\n (3)\n The boundary line should now be located according to the middle of that channel as it was at the time the current ceased to flow therein as a result of the avulsion of 1876.\n\n\n (4)\n A commission consisting of three competent persons, to be named by the court upon the suggestion of counsel, will be appointed to run, locate, and designate the boundary line between the States at the place in question in accordance with the above principles.\n\n\n (5)\n The nature and extent of the erosions and accretions that occurred in the old channel prior to its abandonment by the current as a result of the avulsion of 1876, and the question whether it is practicable now to locate accurately the line of the river as it then ran, will be referred to said commission, subject to a review of its decision by this court if need be.\n The parties may submit the form of an interlocutory decree to carry into effect the above conclusions. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF GEORGIA v. TRUSTEES OF CINCINNATI SOUTHERN RY.(1918)\nNo. 21\nArgued: November 7, 1918Decided: November 18, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. William A. Wimbish, of Atlanta, Ga., for the State of Georgia.\n Messrs. Edward Colston, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Michael M. Allison, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for defendants.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought in this Court by the State of Georgia to prevent the defendants from longer occupying or using any portion of the right of way of the Western & Atlantic Railroad, a railroad built and owned by the \n\n[248 U.S. 26, 27]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff State. The question, although argued at considerable length is a very short one. On October 8, 1879, the State passed an Act (Acts 1878-79, p. 218) sufficiently explained by its contents. \n1\n On August 21, 1916, reciting that the Cincinnati \n\n[248 U.S. 26, 28]\n\u00a0\n Southern Railway now is controlled by a competitor of the Western & Atlantic road and that the Western & Atlantic needs the space, Georgia undertook to repeal the former Act and to treat it as giving a license only, that the State was free to revoke. The defendants say that the words 'there is hereby granted to the Trustees of the Cincinnati Southern Railway, for the use of said railway, the use of that portion of the right of way of the Western & Atlantic Railroad' &c., grant a right of way in fee.\n The Ohio statute under which the Cincinnati Southern Railway was constructed by the City of Cincinnati provided for a board of trustees to be appointed and kept filled by the Superior Court of the city, to have control of the fund raised by the city, and to acquire and hold all the necessary real and personal property and franchises either in Ohio or in any other State into which the line of railroad should extend. Therefore the grant to the trustees was the proper form for a grant in effect to the Railway, as it was styled in the title of the Georgia act, or to the city if the city was in strictness the cestui que trust. No other facts of much importance appear. Considerations are urged on behalf of Georgia to show that the motives for a perpetual grant were weak, but nothing that affects the construction of the words used or that shows that they are not to be given their ordinary meaning, as indeed the argument for the plaintiff agrees. But if that be true, cadit quaestio. A grant of the use of a right of way is the grant of a right of way in the ordinary meaning of words, and a grant of a right of way to a corporation or to perpetual trustees holding for the corporate uses does not need words of succession to be perpetual. The words 'and its successors' or 'in fee' would not enlarge the content of a grant to a corporation. Owensboro v. Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co., \n230 \nU.S. 58, 66\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 988; Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street Ry. Co., \n184 \nU.S. 368, 395\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 410; \n\n[248 U.S. 26, 29]\n\u00a0\n Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Ry. Co., 5 De G. & Sm. 138, 146. If a grantor wishes to limit the effect of words sufficient on their face to convey a fee it should express the limitation in the instrument. The purpose of the grant in this case, to supply a roadbed for a trunk line, necessitating considerable expenditure on the part of the grantee, confirms, if confirmation were required, the legal effect of the words unexplained. City of Louisville v. Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co., \n224 \nU.S. 649, 663\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 572; Llanelly Ry. & Dock Co. v. London & Northwestern Ry. Co., L. R. 8 Ch. 942, 950; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Ry. Co., 5 De G. & Sm. 138.\n We think it unnecessary to refer to the language in detail beyond saying that there is nothing in the statute to suggest an intent to limit the scope of the grant and that such expressions as 'provided further, that the grade adopted by the said Cincinnati Southern Railroad along and over the aforegranted right of way shall always be the same as that of the Western & Atlantic Railroad,' further confirms our interpretation, as does also the requirement of the consent of the lessees 'as to the term of their lease,' since those words imply that that grant is of something more that does not require their assent. Elaborate discussion of the circumstances seems to us superfluous. But it is necessary to mention the objection that by the Constitution of Georgia (article 7,  16) the general assembly was forbidden to 'grant any donation or gratuity in favor of any person, corporation or association,' and that there was no consideration for this grant. Even if the contemplated and invited change of position on the part of the Cincinnati & Southern Railway and the benefit to the State expressly contemplated as ensuing from it were not the conventional inducement of the grant, and so, were not technically a consideration, we are of the opinion that the grant was not a gratuity within the of \n\n[248 U.S. 26, 30]\n\u00a0\n the State Constitution. A conveyance in aid of a public purpose from which great benefits are expected is not within the class of evils that the Constitution intended to prevent and in our opinion is not within the meaning of the word as it naturally would be understood. We deem further argument unnecessary to establish that the State of Georgia made a grant which it cannot now revoke.\n Bill dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] An Act granting right of way to the Cincinnati Southern Railway, where its route adjoins that of the Western & Atlantic Railroad.\n Section 1.

Hilton, both of St. Paul, Minn., for complainant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful, for defendants.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This bill of complaint is filed by the state of Minnesota to quiet title to certain lands in that state, and to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office from issuing patents for the lands to the Immigration Land Company, a corporation of the state of Minnesota. The government filed a motion to dismiss the bill upon the following grounds:\n'1. The court is without jurisdiction to entertain this suit because it is in substance and effect against the United States, which has not consented to be sued or waived its immunity from suit.\n\n'2. There is a defect of parties defendant which cannot be cured without depriving the court of jurisdiction.\n\n'3. The relief prayed for would be an invasion of the lawful jurisdiction of the defendants as officers of the Land Department.\n\n'4. The bill of complaint does not state facts sufficient to entitle the state of Minnesota to any relief.'\n\n From the allegations of the bill it appears that the state claims title to the lands under Act of August 3, 1892, c. 362, 27 Stat. 347.1 \n\n[247 U.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n The Immigration Land Company claims title under section 5 of the Act of March 3, 1887, c. 376, 24 Stat. 556,2 relat- \n\n[247 U.S. 243, 246]\n\u00a0\n ing to the adjustment of land grants to railroad companies.\n The last-named statute provides that where the railroad company shall have sold to citizens of the United States as a part of its grant lands not conveyed to or for the use of the company, said lands being the numbered sections prescribed in the grant, and being coterminous with the constructive parts of the road, and where the lands so sold are for any reason excepted from the operation of the grant, it shall be lawful for a bona fide purchaser thereof from said company, to make payment to the United States for the lands at the ordinary government price for like lands, and thereupon patents shall issue to the bona fide purchaser, his heirs or assigns.\n Under this act, on February 9, 1907, the Land Company made application in the Land Department to purchase the land, claiming to be the assignee of a bona fide purchaser of the lands from the railroad company. The state of Minnesota protested against the issuance of a patent to the Immigration Land Company, and claimed the land under the act of August 3, 1892, under which undisposed-of lands of the United States, situated in certain sections and townships, were granted to the state for a public park. The act of 1892 also provides that it shall not in any manner interfere with, supersede, suspend, modify or annul the vested right of any person, company, or corporation in respect to any of the land existing at the date of the passage of the act.\n A hearing was had before the commissioner of the General Land Office upon the issue made between the \n\n[247 U.S. 243, 247]\n\u00a0\n state of Minnesota and the Immigration Land Company, wherein the Commissioner held:\n'These tracts of land are within the second indemnity limits of the grant to the Northern Pacific Railroad (now Railway) Company, under act of July 2, 1864 (13 Stat. 365), as amended by joint resolution of May 31, 1870 (16 Stat. 378). On October 15, 1883, said railway company selected all of the above described tracts of land per list No. 12, Crookston rearranged list No. 12, filed April 19, 1893. he bases given in support of the selections covered by such rearranged list were lands claimed to have been excepted from the company's grant of July 2, 1864, supra, by reason of the reservation subsisting at the date thereof on account of the grant made by the act of May 5, 1864 (13 Stat. 64), to aid in the construction of the Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad.\n\n'Said list of selections No. 12 was canceled as to these and other tracts of land by letter 'F' of March 20, 1907, upon authority of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the Northern Lumber Co. v. O'Brien, \n204 U.S. 190\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 249, but the cancellation was suspended by the order of the Secretary of the Interior on April 1, 1907, and remained in that status until October 30, 1909, when said list of selections No. 12 was canceled as to these and other tracts of land.\n\n ...\n'The lands above described, with others were sold and conveyed by the Northern Pacific Railway Company by warranty deed for a valuable consideration, January 14, 1891, to Frederick Weyerhaeuser, Peter Musser and M. G. Norton, whose title was afterwards conveyed by certain mesne conveyances to the applicant Immigration Land Company as set forth in its application to purchase dated February 2, 1907, and filed in your office February 9, 1907.'\n\n Of the issues involved the Commissioner said:\n'The attorneys on behalf of the state of Minnesota \n\n[247 U.S. 243, 248]\n\u00a0\n contend that the lands herein involved, which are situated within the limits of the Itasca State Park, were granted to the state by act of August 3, 1892 (27 Stat. 347), and it is urged on the part of the state that the grant took effect immediately, the land being 'undisposed of' on that date, and that the claim asserted by the Immigration Land Company does not have the dignity of the 'vested right,' protected in section 2 of said act.\n\n'On behalf of the Immigration Land Company it is contended that these lands were segregated from the mass of public lands by Crookston indemnity list of selections No. 12, made October 15, 1883, which was not canceled from the records until October 30, 1909; that the sale of the lands covered by cash entry No. 05008, in the name of the Immigration Land Company, by said railway company on January 14, 1891, was bona fide and for a valuable consideration, and it is urged that the Immigration Land Company should have its purchase of said lands protected under section 5 of the act of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. 556), and receive patent therefor; the attorneys for the Land Company contending that the lands involved were not 'undisposed of lands' on August 3, 1892, the date of the grant to the state.'\n\n After an opinion, in which the issues were considered, the Commissioner reached the conclusion.\n'Accordingly, it is held that under section 5 of the act of March 3, 1887, the rights of the Immigration Land Company under the facts and laws above cited are superior to the claim of the state under the act of August 3, 1892, that cash entry 05008 by said Immigration Land Company should remain intact.\n\n'The protest of the state is hereby dismissed subject to the usual right of appeal within thirty days after notice to the Secretary of the Interior.'\n\n The decision of the Commissioner of the General Land Office was affirmed by the Secretary of the Interior, and \n\n[247 U.S. 243, 249]\n\u00a0\n a rehearing denied. State of Minnesota v. Immigration Land Co., 46 Land Dec. 14.\n The purpose of the bill filed in this case is to quiet title to the lands in controversy by a decree in favor of the state of Minnesota notwithstanding the decision of the Secretary of the Interior, and to enjoin that officer from issuing patents for the lands to the Immigration Land Company.\n We are of opinion that the state has mistaken its remedy, and if it be true that the secretary has made a mistake in overruling the contention of the state that the title passed to it under the act of August 3, 1892, relief must be sought in the courts after the issuance f patent.\n The grant to the state of August 3, 1892, was of all undisposed-of lands in certain townships, and section 2 specifically provided that it should not interfere with, supersede, suspend, modify or annul the vested rights of any person, company, or corporation in respect to any of said lands existing at the date of the passage of the act. The act of March 3, 1887, permitting bona fide purchasers of certain lands, in the manner which we have stated, to make payment and acquire title to the lands excepted from the operation of the railroad grant, was then in full force. A part of these lands had been purchased before the act granting them to the state, by the Immigration Land Company, and the Secretary of the Interior held that the title thus acquired was superior to that of the state, and patents were about to be issued, in accordance with the decision of the Secretary, to such bona fide purchaser. This decision is not of an arbitrary character, and was made upon full hearing before the department of the government intrusted with the administration of the public land laws, and the patents were still unissued when this suit was brought.\n This is not a case where the title had passed absolutely in favor of the claimant, as was the fact in Lane v. Watts, \n\n[247 U.S. 243, 250]\n\u00a0\n \n234 U.S. 525\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 965; Id., \n235 U.S. 17\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 3. It is a case where the grant was in terms of 'undisposed-of lands,' and subject to the vested rights of others. As against those holding such lands the title was not intended to pass.\n The act of 1887, under which the Immigration Land Company claims title, specifically provides that patents shall be issued for lands to which the purchaser is entitled. The patents not having issued, the lands in controversy were still in course of administration in that department of the government which, until patent issues, has exclusive control of proceedings to acquire the title.\n As we have said, the remedy must be sought in the courts after the issuance of patent. Under such circumstances as are here disclosed this court has uniformly so held. Litchfield v. The Register et al., 9 Wall. 575, 577; Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v.

Hollister, both of Oshkosh, Wis., for State of Wisconsin.\n Mr. C. Edward Wright, Asst. Atty. Gen., for defendant.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the court.\n This is an original suit brought by the state of Wisconsin claiming title under the school land grant to the state to sections 16 in certain townships in the Menominee Indian Reservation, which lands are alleged to belong to the state or its grantees. \n1\n The bill seeks to enjoin the defendant, the Secretary of the Interior, and through him the Indian occupants of the land, from cutting timber \n\n[245 U.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n or committing waste thereon. The townships in controversy are Nos. 29 and 30 in ranges 13, 14, and 15; township 29 in range 16; township 28 in ranges 15 and 16. These townships are all included in the treaty reservation of 1854, and those in ranges 15 and 16 also in the reservation of 1852, which treaty and reservations are hereinafter considered.\n The question to be decided is whether the school land grant shall prevail over the rights of the Indian occupants.\n The Enabling Act of Wisconsin was approved August 6, 1846 (9 Stat. 56 ). The state was admitted to the Union on May 29, 1848. The Enabling Act ( section 7) provides:\n'That section numbered 16, in every township of the public lands in said state, and where such section has been sold or otherwise disposed of, other lands equivalent thereto, and as contiguous as may be, shall be granted to said state for the use of schools.'\n\n As to the rights of the Indians, it appears that they had occupied a large territory in the state of Wisconsin, and by various treaties, not necessary now to be dwelt upon, had made cessions to the United States. In 1848 the Indians made a treaty ceding the remainder of their lands in Wisconsin to the United States, for which they received lands farther west and the sum of $350,000. This treaty was ratified January 23, 1849. By its terms the Indians were permitted to remain on the ceded lands for two years from October 18, 1848, and until notified by the President that the same were wanted. The Indians did not remove to the West, and in August, 1850, petitioned the President for leave to remain on some of the ceded lands. In their petition the Indians set forth the unsatisfactory character of the lands granted to them in the West, and their desire to remain in Wisconsin. On September 5, 1850, the President gave the Indians permission to remain upon the ceded lands until June 1, 1851; this time was \n\n[245 U.S. 427, 430]\n\u00a0\n subsequently extended by the President to October 1, 1852. On September 30, 1851, the local Superintendent of Indian Affairs reported to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs that in pursuance of instructions he had explored the country on the Wolf and Oconto rivers in Wisconsin for a location for the Menominee Indians, and for that purpose recommended a rectangular tract of land; this tract of land was to commence at the southeast corner of township 28 on the range line between 19 and 20 and run west 30 miles, north 18 miles, and thence back east and south to the place of beginning. The tract embraced 18 townships, 6 of which on the west are included within the limits of the lands described in the treaty of 1854, hereinafter referred to.\n On August 30, 1852, Congress appropriated money for the removal of the Indians to the lands designated by the Superintendent. 10 Stat. 41, 47. On November 30, 1852, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reported to the Secretary of the Interior that the removal of the Menominee Indians, as contemplated by the act of Congress passed the preceding session, had been satisfactorily effected, and that the whole tribe had been concentrated on the designated territory between the Wolf and Oconto rivers, a location with which they were well pleased, and on which they were anxious to be permitted to remain permanently.\n On February 1, 1853, the state of Wisconsin by joint resolution of its Legislature gave its assent to this removal, in the following terms:\n'That the assent of the state of Wisconsin is hereby given to the Menominee Nation of Indians to remain on the tract of land set apart for them by the President of the United States, on the Wolf and Oconto rivers, and upon which they now reside, the same being within the state of Wisconsin aforesaid, and described as follows, to wit:\n\n'Commencing at the southeast corner of town[ship] 28 \n\n[245 U.S. 427, 431]\n\u00a0\n north, range 19, running thence west thirty miles, thence north eighteen miles, thence east thirty miles, thence south 18 miles, to the place of beginning.'\n\n Laws Wis. 1853 (Joint Resolutions) p. 110, c. 1.\n On November 26, 1853, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs made a report in which he said that by the treaty of 1848 the removal of the Menominee Indians to a place west of the Mississippi River was contemplated, but that it was thought preferable to concentrate them on the Upper Wolf and Oconto rivers in the state of Wisconsin, and suggested, among other things, that the Indians could properly remain where they were for many years, without interference with the white population, suggesting, however, that if such arrangement were to be of a permanent character, a new convention should be made with them, which would be necessary for their relinquishment of the country given to them by the treaty of 1848. This recommendation probably gave rise to the treaty of 1854, by which the Indians, for the recited purpose of acquiring the new lands for a permanent home, agreed to relinquish to the United States all lands assigned to them by the treaty of October 18, 1848; in consideration of which cession the United States agreed to give to the Indians for a home, to be held as Indian lands are held, 'that tract of country lying upon the Wolf river, in the state of Wisconsin, commencing at the southeast corner of township 28 north of range 16 east of the fourth principal meridian, running west 24 miles, thence north eighteen miles, thence east twenty- four miles, thence south eighteen miles, to the place of beginning, the same being townships 28, 29 and 30, of ranges 13, 14, 15 and 16, according to the public surveys.' This tract embraced six of the townships included in the Indian reservation of 1852, and six townships to the west thereof. The sixteenth sections in five of the former and four of the latter are here in controversy. \n\n[245 U.S. 427, 432]\n\u00a0\n It appears that as to three of these townships the surveys were not approved until February 20, 1854, and as to the other townships the surveys of two were approved October 11, 1854, and of the others on dates ranging from February 6, 1855, to October 9, 1891\n\n\n It is evident from a consideration of the terms of the Enabling Act ( section 7), that Congress did not make an unconditional grant in praesenti to the state of the school sections; the terms of the grant are that the sections 'shall be' granted. Moreover, the grant contemplated that Congress might make other disposition of the lands. The state of Wisconsin's right to the lands in controversy was to be subordinate to such disposition; in which event the state should seek indemnity in other lands for the loss of school sections.\n The Menominee Indians by the treaty of 1848 gave up their holdings in Wisconsin, but were not removed to the lands provided for them in the West. They had the privilege of remaining in Wisconsin for two years, and until notified by the President that the lands were wanted; this permission was extended, ultimately until October, 1852; in the meantime the Indians were located by the action of the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and by the act of Congress, with the approval of the President, upon the reservation created in 1852. True, the act of Congress appropriating money for the removal referred to the temporary character of the location, but they were thus located subject to the control of Congress, and, as we have seen, with the consent of the state, if that were needed.\n We think this recited action was a disposition, prior to survey, of the school sections, which was clearly within the authority of Congress to make and sanctioned by the terms of section 7 of the Enabling Act. This action being before survey took these lands out of the scope of the grant for school purposes, and made them subject \n\n[245 U.S. 427, 433]\n\u00a0\n to ultimate disposition by Congress for the benefit of the Indians. This was accomplished by the treaty of 1854, which adds to the reserved lands six townships on the west and includes the six westerly townships of the reservation of 1852. That treaty is comprehensive in its terms, it recites the unwillingness of the Indians to remove to the lands provided for them to the west of the Mississippi River, and sets forth the purpose to exchange those lands for the lands desired by the tribe for a permanent home. To that end the Menominee Indians agreed to cede, and did cede, to the United States all lands assigned to them under the treaty of October 18, 1848, and in consideration of this cession the United States gave to the Indians, for a home to be held as Indian lands are held, the lands described in the treaty, in the 12 townships to which we have referred. The occupancy and rights of the Indians so established have never been terminated, but still continue.\n In view of these statements of fact, and the purposes of the government and the Indians in the transactions referred to, we regard the case as controlled by the decision of this court in United States v. Morrison, \n240 U.S. 192\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 326, which deals with a similar grant of lands for school purposes to the state of Oregon. In that case the previous decision of this court were reviewed, and in concluding the discussion of the effect of such school land grants this court said:\n'The designation of these sections was a convenient method of devoting a fixed proportion of public lands to school uses, but Congress in making its compacts with the states did not undertake to warrant that the designated sections would exist in every township, or that, if existing, the state should at all events take title to the particular lands found to be therein. Congress did undertake, however, that these sections should be granted unless they had been sold or otherwise disposed of; that is, that on the survey, defining the sec- \n\n[245 U.S. 427, 434]\n\u00a0\n tions, the title to the lands should pass to the state provided sale or other disposition had not previously been made, and, if it had been made, that the state should be entitled to select equivalent lands for the described purpose.' \n240 U.S. 201\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 329 (60 L. Ed. 599).\n\n The principles, thus stated, are applicable here. In our view the lands were otherwise disposed of by the Indian reservation of 1852 and the treaty of 1854. As we have seen, these dispositions were made before final approval of the surveys identifying sections 16.\n It is insisted that this conclusion is inconsistent with the decision of this court in Beecher v. Wetherby, \n95 U.S. 517\n. The same contention as to the effect of that decision was made in the Morrison Case, supra, and of it this court said:\n'In opposition to this definition of the effect of the donation for school purposes, the appellees rely upon what was said in Beecher v. Wetherby, \n95 U.S. 517\n [24 L. Ed. 440]. That was an action of replevin to recover logs cut on a section 16 in Wisconsin which had been granted by the Enabling Act of August 6, 1846 (chapter 89, 9 Stat. 56, 58). The exterior lines of the township in which the land was situated were run in October, 1852, and the section lines in May and June, 1854; and the defendant claimed under patents from the state issued in 1865 and 1870. The land had been occupied by the Menominee Indians, but their right was only that of occupancy. 'The fee was in the United States, subject to that right, and could be transferred by them whenever they chose.' By the treaty of 1848 (9 Stat. 952) these Indians agreed to cede to the United States all their lands in Wisconsin, it being stipulated that they should be entitled to remain on the lands for two years. In view of their unwillingness to withdraw, a further act was passed (10 Stat. 1064) by which a tract was assigned to them embracing the land in controversy. Subsequently a portion of this reservation \n\n[245 U.S. 427, 435]\n\u00a0\n was assigned by another treaty to the Stockbridge and Munsee Tribes, and for the benefit of the latter Congress passed the act of February 6, 1871 (16 Stat. 404, c. 38), providing for the sale of certain townships. The plaintiff asserted title under patents issued by the United States in 1872 pursuant to this act. It appeared, however, that the Indian occupation of the land had ceased before the logs were cut. The court held that the title had vested in the state, and hence that the plaintiff had acquired no title by his patents from the United States. It was said in the opinion that by the contract with the state (the school grant) the lands were 'withdrawn from any other disposition, and set apart from the public domain, so that no subsequent law authorizing the sale of it could be construed to embrace them, although they were not specially excepted,' and that after this compact 'no subsequent sale or other disposition ... could defeat the appropriation.' But it was also stated that 'when the logs in suit were cut, those tribes (Stockbridge and Munsee) had removed from the land in controversy, and other sections had been set apart for their occupation.' That is, the lands had been surveyed in 1854; prior to that time there had been no other disposition of the fee by the United States; the title had vested in the state subject at most to the Indian occupancy, and this had terminated. There was abundant reason for the decision that these lands were not embraced, and were not intended to be embraced, in the provisions for sale made by the act of 1871. What was said in the opinion must be considered in the light of the facts. Weyerhauser v. Hoyt, \n219 U.S. 380\n, 394 [ 31 Sup. Ct. 300].

CLUM(1918)\nNo. 89\nArgued: Decided: February 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 605, 606]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Bernard B. Selling and James McNamara, both of Detroit, Mich., for Stellwagen. \n\n[245 U.S. 605, 607]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alfred Clum, George B. Marty, and Harvey D. Goulder, all of Cleveland, Ohio, for Clum.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here upon certificate from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. From the statement accompanying the certificate it appears that Stellwagen, trustee for Margaret Zengerle, filed a petition in the United States District Court to require the surrender and transfer to him of a quantity of white pine lumber and balance due upon a certain open account then in possession of Clum as trustee in bankruptcy of the Georgian Bay Company. The order was denied, the petition dismissed, and appeal taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The questions are whether certain provisions of the statutes of Ohio are suspended by virtue of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. The facts upon which the questions arise, and in view of which they are to be answered, are thus stated:\n'The Georgian Bay Company, an Ohio corporation, was at the time of the transactions in dispute engaged in the wholesale and retail lumber business at Cleveland, Ohio. February 2, 1910, the company delivered to appellant's predecessor (A. L. McBean), as trustee for Margaret Zengerle and the Dime Savings Bank of Detroit, its bill of sale, describing 433,500 feet of white pine lumber then in the company's yards, and stating a total price of $14,013; crediting the trustee with certain promissory notes of the company for a like sum and payable in different amounts, to the order of Margaret Zengerle, C. M. Zengerle, agent, and the Dime Savings Bank, respectively. Neither the bill of sale nor a copy was filed with the recorder of Cuyahoga county, Ohio; but the lumber so in terms sold consisted of piles (stacked in the ordinary way) which were to be and at the time in fact were each dis- \n\n[245 U.S. 605, 608]\n\u00a0\n tinctly marked: 'Sold to A. L. McB., Agt.' May 3, 1910, the company with consent of McBean sold this lumber and certain of its own lumber then in the yards, to Schuette & Co. of Pittsburgh. Payment was to be made by Schuette & Co., part in cash, part in notes maturing at fixed times between date of sale and the following September 10th and the balance in cash on or before October 1st. Two days later, May 5th, the Georgian Bay Company transferred to appellant 'the balance, twenty-five per cent. of in oice value or what may show due on the 1st of October, A. D. 1910, of the purchase price of the lumber' (so sold to Schuette & Co.), to secure payment in full of all moneys that should be advanced by, and 'payment pro rata of all moneys' then owing to, the Dime Savings Banks, Mrs. Zengerle and C. M. Zengerle, agent; and any surplus remaining was to be returned to the company. Schuette & Co., while owing a balance of $7,500 on portions of the lumber it had received, rejected the rest; this can be identified and is worth about $4,000. It was the transfer of this balance and the surrender of this rejected lumber that appellant sought in the court below.\n\n'October 31, 1910, the Georgian Bay Company made a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, which was properly filed the following November 7th; and on the 9th of that month the company was adjudicated a bankrupt. At the time there remained due from the bankrupt to Mrs. Zengerle $7,100. C. M. Zengerle is the husband of Margaret Zengerle, and was the president of the Georgian Bay Company; the notes payable to his wife represented loans of money belonging to her; and in negotiating those loans and in the transaction had under the bill of sale, he acted as her agent and as president of the company. The theory of the court below was that the bill of sale ( February 2, 1910) was intended merely as security and, not having been deposited in accordance with section 4150 (2 Bates' Ann. Ohio Stat. p. 2302) concerning \n\n[245 U.S. 605, 609]\n\u00a0\n chattel mortgages, was null and void; that the transfer (May 5th) of balance accruing October 1st from Schuette & Co. was made with intent to hinder and delay creditors, when, according to the laws and the rule of judicial decision of the state of Ohio, the Georgian Bay Company was insolvent, though not according to the Bankruptcy Act; that Margaret Zengerle was, through her agent, C. M. Zengerle chargeable with knowledge of such intent and insolvency, and the Savings Bank was not; that as to Margaret Zengerle the transfer was null and void and so was set aside, but that the Savings Bank was entitled to be paid out of the balance of the Schuette account. No appeal was taken from the portion of the decree which allowed recovery by the Savings Bank.'\n\n The statutes of the state of Ohio in question are sections 6343 and 6344 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio as amended April 30, 1908, 99 Ohio Laws, 241, 242. These sections were arranged under the General Code of Ohio approved February 15, 1910, wherein they appear as sections 11102 to 11107 inclusive. (These sections are given in the certificate, as they stood February 2, 1910, and are found in the margin.1) \n\n[245 U.S. 605, 610]\n\u00a0\n The claim is stated to be that section 6343 when considered in connection with the chapter concerning insolvent debtors is suspended by the Bankruptcy Act. Reliance is had for this contention upon the following portion of section 6343 which provides:\n'A receiver may be appointed who shall take charge of all the assets of such debtor or debtors, including the property so sold, conveyed, transferred, mortgaged, or assigned, which receiver shall administer all the\n\n___ the county recorder of the county in which such seller or transferrer conducts his business, and in the office of the county recorder of the county or counties in which such goods are located, a notice of his intention to make such sale or transfer, which notice shall be in writing describing in general terms the property to be sold and all conditions of such sale and the parties thereto; excepting, however, that no such presumption shall arise ecause of the failure to record notice as above provided in the case of any sale or transfer made under the direction or order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or by an executor, administrator, guardian, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors or other officer or person acting in the regular and proper discharge of official duty or in the discharge of any trust imposed upon him by law, nor in the case of any sale or transfer of any property exempt from execution.\n Sec. 6344. Any creditor or creditors, as to whom any of the acts or things prohibited in the preceding section are void, whether the claim of such creditor or creditors has matured or will thereafter mature, may commence an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to have such acts or things declared void. And such court shall appoint a trustee or receiver according to the provisions of this chapter, who upon being duly qualified shall proceed by due course of law to recover possession of all property so sold, conveyed, transferred, mortgaged or assigned, and to administer the same for the equal benefit of all creditors, as in other cases of assignments to trustees for the benefit of creditors. And any assignee as to whom any thing or act mentioned in the preceding section shall be void, shall likewise commence a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover possession of all property so sold, conveyed, transferred, mortgaged or assigned, and shall administer the same for the equal benefit of all creditors as in other cases of assignments to trustees for the benefit of creditors. 99 Ohio Laws, 241, 242. \n\n[245 U.S. 605, 611]\n\u00a0\n assets of the debtor or debtors for the equal benefit of all the creditors of the debtor or debtors in proportion to the amount of their respective demands, including those which are unmatured.'\n The questions propounded are:\n'(a) Whether the Bankruptcy Act of the United States, in force on the dates herein mentioned, operated to suspend section 6343 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, as such section stood February 2, 1910\n\n\n\n'(b) Whether the Bankruptcy Act operated to suspend the sections into which section 6343 was divided and numbered, February 15, 1910, by the General Code of Ohio, to wit, sections 11102, 11103, 11104 and 11105 as such sections existed May 5, 1910.\n\n'(c) If the Bankruptcy Act did not operate to suspend in their entirety the several sections of the Ohio statutes mentioned in the preceding questions, whether such suspension extended only to the portions thereof which in \n\n[245 U.S. 605, 612]\n\u00a0\n terms appropriated, for the benefit of all the creditors, the property of the debtor not specifically described in the bill of sale and transfer of account in dispute.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals also sends an opinion in re the certification aforesaid, in which the court says that it is disposed to hold that if the provisions of the Ohio statutes were suspended, the appellant is entitled in behalf of Margaret Zengerle to recover, otherwise the trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to hold the balance due from Schuette & Co. and the lumber rejected by them, and administer the same as the part of the estate of the bankrupt for the benefit of its general creditors. The court states that as between Mrs. Zengerle and the general creditors of the Georgian Bay Company, there was sufficient delivery of possession of lumber covered by the bill of sale to dispense with the necessity of depositing the instrument with the county recorder. The sale subsequently made to Schuette & Co., upon the consent of Mrs. Zengerle's trustee, was a distinct recognition of the intent and effect of the bill of sale, and the marking of the piles of lumber, and the transfer of account made two days later was manifestly designed at once to execute the transaction involved under the bill, and transfer the rights thereunder of Mrs. Zengerle, as well as of the Savings Bank, to the sales's proceeds. The court further says, upon the hypothesis that the state statutes are suspended, that because more than four months elapsed between the delivery of the bill of sale, as also of the transfer of account, and the bankruptcy, the trustee cannot by virtue of the Bankruptcy Act alone question the validity of either of those instruments. The court adds that if the state statutes were not suspended, the general creditors were not suspended, the instruments in dispute set aside because, under the facts shown, the company was not able to meet its debts as they fell due, and so was insolvent; and, further, the instruments in terms were \n\n[245 U.S. 605, 613]\n\u00a0\n made to a trustee. The rights so vested in the creditors being enforceable at any time within four years under the Ohio law.\n The federal Constitution, article I, section 8 gives Congress the power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy throughout the United States. In view of this grant of authority to the Congress it has been settled from an early date that state laws to the extent that they conflict with the laws of Congress, enacted under its constitutional authority, on the subject of bankruptcies are suspended. While this is true, state laws are thus suspended only to the extent of actual conflict with the system provided by the Bankruptcy Act of Congress. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122; Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213.\n Notwithstanding this requirement as to uniformity the bankruptcy acts of Congress may recognize the laws of the state in certain particulars, although such recognition may lead to different results in different states. For example, the Bankruptcy Act recognizes and enforces the laws of the states affecting dower, exemptions, the validity of mortgages, priorties of payment and the like. Such recognition in the application of state laws does not affect the constitutionality of the Bankruptcy Act, although in these particulars the operation of the Act is not alike in all the states. Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, \n186 \nU.S. 181, 188\n, 189 S., 190, 22 Sup. Ct. 857. True it is that general assignments for the benefit of creditors are acts of bankruptcy, Act of 1898, section 3, clause 4, and since the amendment of 1903, 32 Stat. 797, a receivership of an insolvent debtor with a view to distribution of his property for the benefit of creditors will have the like effect. 1 Loveland on Bankruptcy ( 4th Ed.)  153. In such cases the bankruptcy proceedings, taken within four months, displace those in the state court and terminate the jurisdiction of the latter. R ndolph v. Scruggs, \n190 \nU.S. 533, 537\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 710; In re Watts & Sacks, 190 U. S. \n\n[245 U.S. 605, 614]\n\u00a0\n 1, 31, 23 Sup. Ct. 718. But it does not follow that state statutes intended to avoid conveyances actually or constructively fraudulent and thereby to promote the equal distribution of insolvent estates may not be availed of by the trustee. Section 70e of the Bankruptcy Act provides:\n'The trustee may avoid any transfer by the bankrupt of his property which any creditor of such bankrupt might have avoided, and may recover the property so transferred, or its value, from the person to whom it was transferred, unless he was a bona fide holder for value prior to the date of the adjudication. Such property may be recovered or its value collected from whoever may have received it, except a bona fide holder for value. For the purpose of such recovery any court of bankruptcy as hereinbefore defined, and any state court which would have had jurisdiction if bankruptcy had not intervened, shall have concurrent jurisdiction.'\n\n This section as construed by this court gives the trustee in bankruptcy a right of action to recover property transferred in violation of state law. Security Warehousing Co. v. Hand, \n206 \nU.S. 415, 425\n, 426 S., 27 Sup. Ct. 720, 11 Ann. Cas. 789; Knapp v. Milwaukee Trust Co., \n216 \nU.S. 545, 548\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 412.\n And a right of action under this subdivision is not subject to the four months' limitation of other sections (60b, 67e) of the Bankruptcy Act. Under this subdivision if a creditor could have avoided a transfer under a state law, a trustee may do the same. In re Mullen (D. C.) 101 Fed. 413 ( opinion by Judge Lowell); 1 Loveland on Bankruptcy (4th Ed.) 786, 787; Collier on Bankruptcy (11th Ed.) p. 1178, and cases cited in note 439.\n Turning now to the sections of the Ohio laws in question-the right to proceed by due course of law to recover particular property transferred as prohibited in section 6344, and to cause the same to be administered for the equal benefit of creditors, as in cases of assignment to trustees for the benefit of creditors, has long been part of the stat- \n\n[245 U.S. 605, 615]\n\u00a0\n utory law of Ohio. The part in section 6343 wich enables the court to appoint a receiver to take charge of all the assets of the debtor or debtors, including the property conveyed, and administer the same for the equal benefit of creditors, is the new feature of the law.\n It is apparent that this section intends to permit the appointment of a receiver to take charge of all the assets of the debtor when the provisions of the statute apply as to the debtor and his transferee, and the latter is required to know of the fraudulent intent on the part of the debtor.\n Creditors are not thereby deprived of rights, but in case of bankruptcy proceedings within four months of a general assignment for creditors, as was the case here, the property may be brought into the bankruptcy court, or, as in this case, may be in its possession and be retained in that court to be administered for the benefit of general creditors. This state statute is not opposed to the policy of the bankruptcy law or in contravention of the rules and principles established by it with a view to the fair distribution of the assets of the insolvent. It is only state laws which conflict with the bankruptcy laws of Congress that are suspended; those which are in aid of the Bankruptcy Act can stand. Miller v. New Orleans Fertilizer Co., \n211 U.S. 496\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 176.\n This view of the sections in question was taken by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, in Re Farrell, 176 Fed. 505, 509, 510, 100 C. C. A. 63, wherein in the opinion it was said that the changes made by the new statutes were in harmony with the policy of the Bankruptcy Act and in aid of its purposes.\n There is much discussion in the books as to what constitutes a bankruptcy act as distinguished from an insolvency law. It is settled that a state may not pass an inso vency law which provides for a discharge of the debtor from his obligations, which shall have the effect of a bankruptcy discharge as to creditors in other states, and this although no general federal bankruptcy act is in effect. \n\n[245 U.S. 605, 616]\n\u00a0\n And while it is not necessary to decide that there may not be state insolvent laws which are suspended although not providing for a discharge of indebtedness, all the cases lay stress upon the fact that one of the principal requisites of a true bankruptcy law is for the benefit of the debtor in that it discharges his future acquired property from the obligation of existing debts.\n In the case of Mayer v. Hellman, \n91 U.S. 496\n, this court had before it, while the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 was in force, the question of the validity of the assignment of an insolvent, in Ohio, to trustees for the benefit of all his creditors executed six months before the proceedings in bankruptcy had been taken, and it was held that the assignment was good and the assignees in bankruptcy not entitled to the possession of the property. Mr. Justice Field in delivering the opinion of the court said:\n'In the argument of the counsel of the defendant in error, the position is taken that the Bankrupt Act suspends the operation of the act of Ohio regulating the mode of administering assignments for the benefit of creditors, treating the latter as an insolvent law of the state. The answer is, that the statute of Ohio is not an insolvent law in any proper sense of the term. It does not compel, or in terms even authorize, assignments; it assumes, that such instruments were conveyances previously known, and only prescribes a mode by which the trust created shall be enforced. It provides for the security of the creditors by exacting a bond from the trustees for the discharge of their duties; it requires them to file statements showing what they have done with the property; and affords in various ways the means of compelling them to carry out the purposes of the conveyance. There is nothing in the act resembling an insolvent law. It does not discharge the insolvent from arrest or imprisonment; it leaves his after- acquired property liable to his creditors precisely as though no assignment had been made. The provisions \n\n[245 U.S. 605, 617]\n\u00a0\n for enforcing a trust are substantially such as a court of chancery would apply in the absence of any statutory provision. The assignment in this case must, therefore, be regarded as though the statute of Ohio, to which reference is made, had no existence. There is an insolvent law in that state; but the assignment in question was not made in pursuance of any of its provisions. The position, therefore, of counsel, that the bankrupt law of Congress suspends all proceedings under the insolvent law of the state, has no application.'\n\n The federal system of bankruptcy is designed not only to distribute the property of the debtor, not by law exempted, fairly and equally among his creditors, but as a main purpose of the act, intends to aid the unfortunate debtor by giving him a fresh start in life, free from debts, except of a certain character, after the property which he owned at the time of bankruptcy has been administered for the benefit of creditors. Our decisions lay great stress upon this feature of the law-as one not only of private but of great public interest in that it secures to the unfortunate debtor, who surrenders his property for distribution, a new opportunity in life.

S.) 148.\n This feature of a bankruptcy law is wholly wanting in the Ohio statutes under consideration. Indeed, there is not now, any more than when Mayer v. Hellman, supra, was de ided, any attempt in the Ohio laws to provide for the discharge of the debtor from his existing debts.\n If the Ohio statutes in the feature now under consideration be suspended, it would follow that a person in Ohio might successfully claim a part of the estate which is being administered in bankruptcy, although the conveyance under which the property is claimed is voidable under the laws of the state where it was made and the alleged right \n\n[245 U.S. 605, 618]\n\u00a0\n in the property secured. We think that Congress in the Bankruptcy Act did not intend any such result, but meant to permit the trustee in bankruptcy to have the benefit of state laws of this character which do not conflict with the aims and purposes of the federal law. And certainly, in view of the provisions of section 70e of the Bankruptcy Act, Congress did not intend to permit a conveyance such as is here involved to stand which creditors might attack and avoid under the state law for the benefit of general creditors of the estate.\n From what we have said it follows that questions A and B should be answered in the negative, and it is unnecessary to answer question C.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 6343.

SECOND NAT BANK OF CINCINNATI, OHIO(1918)\nNo. 378\nArgued: November 8, 1918Decided: December 9, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edmund H. Dryer and Forney, Johnston, both of Birmingham, Ala ., for petitioner. \n\n[248 U.S. 73, 74]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lawrence Maxwell, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the court.\n The plaintiff, as receiver of the Alabama Trust & Savings Company, a banking corporation organized under the laws of the state of Alabama, filed his bill in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, against the Second National Bank of Cincinnati to recover sums of money for which he alleged the Second National Bank was liable on account of certain transactions which had taken place between the National Bank and the Savings Company and its officers the details of which it is unnecessary to set forth. Upon final hearing the District Court found the defendant liable for the application of a balance of the Savings Company's deposit in the National Bank, upon paper held by it on which the Savings Company appeared as principal maker, but which was found to have been given for the benefit of certain of the Savings Company's officers. Plaintiff's remaining claims were rejected. Both parties appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which reversed the decree of the District Court, upon the ground that the receiver had no authority to bring the suit (246 Fed. 753, 159 C. C. A. 55 ), and the case is here on writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n In the year 1911 certain creditors of the Savings Company, an Alabama corporation, filed a bill against it in a chancery court of Alabama alleging its insolvency.\n The chancery court on April 27, 1911, rendered a final administration decree wherein it found that the defendant Savings Company was insolvent; that its assets constituted a trust fund for the payment of its creditors, and the same should be marshaled and administered in that court; that the defendant was a corporation organized under the General Laws of Alabama; that upon final \n\n[248 U.S. 73, 75]\n\u00a0\n settlement it should be dissolved; that it had suspended business and was not about to resume the same, and could not do so with safety to the public; that, therefore, W. C. Sterrett be appointed receiver of defendant, and empovered and directed to demand and take into his possession all of the defendant's assets and property to which it was entitled and to recover the same and reduce it to money, and administer the same under the further order of the court. And the court further authorized the receiver to employ counsel and to bring such actions at law or in equity as he might be advised and to incur such expenses as might be necessary. Later, on March 8, 1912, the Alabama chancery court specifically directed the receiver, plaintiff herein, to bring this suit in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division.\n The material parts of the sections of the Code of Alabama (1907, vol. 2, pp. 430, 433), pertinent to this case, provide as follows:\n'3509. ... The assets of insolvent corporations constitute a trust fund for the payment of the creditors of such corporations, which may be marshaled and administered in courts of equity in this state.'\n\n Section 3511 provides for the dissolution of corporations by action of the stockholders, and enacts that the court--\n'... shall appoint a receiver of all the books, property, and assets of the corporation ... (who) shall, under the direction of the court, collect all debts due the corporation, and sell all the property, real and personal, of the corporation, pay the debts thereof ratably or in full as the funds realized may admit, and divide the residue after the debts and costs are paid, among the several classes of stockholders, according to the amount owned by each, and according to the preferences, if any, of the several classes as provided in the certificates of incorporation.' \n\n[248 U.S. 73, 76]\n\u00a0\n Section 3512 covers the application for receivership and dissolution of insolvent corporations upon bill of creditors or stockholders in the chancery court, and provides:\n\n'... The court ... may appoint a receiver of all the property and assets of the corporation ... (who) under the direction of the court, must exercise the same powers and perform the same duties as are required of receivers in the next preceding section, and otherwise manage the affairs of the corporation pending final settlement thereof as the court shall direct. ...'\n\n There is also a provision for proceedings by the attorney general ( page 444):\n'3560. Proceedings when bank found not solvent-Whenever the treasurer finds that a bank or corporation chartered by the laws of this state and doing a banking business, is not in a solvent condition, he shall immediately report the condition of the bank to the governor, and the governor shall direct the attorney general to institute proceedings in a court having jurisdiction in the county where the bank or parent bank is located, to put the bank in the hands of some competent person, who shall give bond in an amount to be fixed by the judge for the faithful discharge of his duties, and said person so appointed shall immediately take charge of the business of said bank, collecting its assets and paying off its liabilities under the law and rules of such court.'\n\n The question presented for our consideration is whether the receiver appointed in the chancery court is authorized to sue in the federal court for the recovery of such property.\n Since the decision of this court in Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322, it is the settled doctrine in federal jurisprudence that a chancery receiver has no authority to sue in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction to recover demands or property therein situated. The functions and authority of such receiver are confined to the jurisdiction in which \n\n[248 U.S. 73, 77]\n\u00a0\n he was appointed. The reasons for this rule were fully discussed in Booth v. Clark and have been reiterated in later decisions of this court. Hale v. Allinson, \n188 U.S. 56\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 244; Great Western Mining & Manufacturing Co. v. Harris, \n198 \nU.S. 561, 575\n, 577 S., 25 Sup. Ct. 770; Keatley v. Furey, \n226 \nU.S. 399, 403\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 121. This practice has become general in the courts of the United States, and is a system well understood and followed. It permits an application for an ancillary receivership in a foreign jurisdiction where the local assets may be recovered and, if necessary, administered. The system established in Booth v. Clark has become the settled law of the federal courts, and, if the powers of chancery receivers are to be enlarged in such wise as to give them authority to sue beyond the jurisdiction of the appointing court, such extension of authority must come from legislation and not from judicial action. Great Western Mining & Manufacturing Co. v. Harris, supra, 198 U. S. page 577, 25 Sup. Ct. 770\n\n\n Counsel for petitioner insists that the case is not ruled by the doctrine of Booth v. Clark, and that under the Alabama statutes and the decisions of the Supreme Court of that state the title to the property of the Trust Company is vested in the receiver in such wise that he is authorized to sue for its recovery in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction. If this contention is well founded there is no question of the authority of the receiver to prosecute the action. Relfe v. Rundle, \n103 U.S. 222\n; Hawkins v. Glenn, \n131 U.S. 319\n, 9 Sup.

To rehearse them now would be but a repetition of what is said in that poinion. \n\n[248 U.S. 73, 78]\n\u00a0\n An examination of the sections of the statutes, here involved, in the light of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Alabama, does not in our opinion warrant the conclusion that title is vested in the receiver as assignee or as statutory successor of the insolvent corporation in such wise as to authorize the action to recover in a foreign jurisdiction. Collectively, these sections provide for a receivership to administer the property and assets of the insolvent corporation under the authority and direction of the appointing court. The statutes do not undertake to vest in the receiver an estate in the property to be administered for the benefit of creditors as was the case in Bernheimer v. Converse, supra, and Converse v. Hamilton, supra, in which the right to sue in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction was sustained.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals left open the question of the right to apply for an ancillary receivership in the District Court, and the effect of such appointment, if made, upon the pending suit. We pursue the like course, and as such an application could only originate in the District Court we express no opinion concerning it.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","155":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUNDAY LAKE IRON CO. v. TOWNSHIP OF WAKEFIELD(1918)\nNo. 38\nArgued: November 9, 1917Decided: June 3, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. Horace Andrews, of Cleveland, Ohio, and William P. Belden, of Ishpeming, Mich., for plaintiff in error.[ Sunday Lake Iron Co v. Township of Wakefield \n247 U.S. 350\n (1918) ]\n\n\n[247 U.S. 350, 352]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James A. O'Neill, of Ironwood, Mich., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error to a state court and the only matter for our consideration is the claim that contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment plaintiff in error was denied equal protection of the laws by the state board of tax assessors which assessed its property for 1911 at full value, whereas other lands throughout the county were generally assessed at not exceeding one-third of their actual worth. Proceeding in entire good faith, an inexperienced local assessor adopted the valuation which his predecessor had placed upon the company's property-sixty-five thousand dollars; the county board of review approved his action. Reviewing this in the light of a subsequent detailed report by experts appointed under a special act of the Legislature passed in April, 1911, to appraise all mining properties, the state board raised the assessment to $1,071,000; but, because of alleged lack of time and inadequate information, it declined to order a new and general survey of values or generally to increase other assessments, notwithstanding plaintiff in error represented and offered to present evidence showing that they amounted to no more than one-third of true market values.\n The purpose of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is to secure every person within the state's jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination, whether occasioned by express terms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents. And it must be regarded as settled that intentional systematic undervaluation by state officials of \n\n[247 U.S. 350, 353]\n\u00a0\n other taxable property in the same class contravenes the constitutional right of one taxed upon the full value of his property. Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co., \n207 \nU.S. 20, 35\n, 37 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 7, 12 Ann. Cas. 757. It is also clear that mere errors of judgment by officials will not support a claim of discrimination. There must be something more- something which in effect amounts to an intentional violation of the essential principle of practical uniformity. The good faith of such officers and the validity of their actions are presumed; when assailed, the burden of proof is upon the complaining party. Head Money Cases, \n112 \nU.S. 580, 595\n, 5 S. Sup.

Ct. 326.\n The record discloses facts which render it more than probable that plaintiff in error's mines were assessed for the year 1911 (but not before or afterwards) relatively higher than other lands within the county although the statute enjoined the same rule for all. But we are unable to conclude that the evidence suffices clearly to establish that the state board entertained or is chargeable with any purpose or design to discriminate. Its action is not incompatible with an honest effort in new and difficult circumstances to adopt valuations not relatively unjust or unequal. When plaintiff in error first challenged the values placed upon the property of others no adequate time remained for detailed consideration nor was there sufficient evicence before the board to justify immediate and general revaluations. The very next year a diligent and, so far as appears, successful effort was made to rectify any inequality.

BEHREND(1918)\nNo. 267\nArgued: April 25, 1918Decided: June 3, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. Howard C. Wiggins, of Rome, N. Y., and Philip Walker, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. W. Gwynn Gardiner, of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[247 U.S. 394, 395]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Supreme Council of the Royal Arcanum is incorporated under the laws of Massachusetts as a fraternal benefit society, and it is licensed as a fraternal beneficial association in the District of Columbia. \n1\n The character and purposes of the organization and the relation to its members are described in Supreme Council of the Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 U.S. 531\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 724, L. R. A. 1916A, 771. Samuel K. Behrend became a member of a local lodge of the order in Washington, known as 'Oriental Council, No. 312, Royal Arcanum.' On March 1, 1899, a $3,000 'benefit certificate' was issued to him there, payable on his death to his wife, Sue, as beneficiary; and there the first premium or assessment was paid. He delivered the certificate to her, giving it as a wedding present. From that time on, the certificate remained in her possession; and until August, 1913, most of the premiums and assessments were paid by her. On August 8, 1913, Behrend, having ceased to live with his wife, requested the order to change the beneficiary from his wife to his son and his daughter. As the original certificate was still in the wife's possession and she refused to surrender it, Behrend made affidavit that the certificate was beyond his control and in writing relinquished all interest therein. Thereupon a new certificate was issued by the order payable to the children, as requested; and the wife was notified that the certificate held by her had been canceled. On October 20, 1914, Behrend died. On December 21, 1914, the order paid to his son and to his daughter each $1,500 upon surrender of the new certificate. Thereafter the widow brought, in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, this action to recover $3,000 under the original certificate. \n\n[247 U.S. 394, 396]\n\u00a0\n The order set up, by plea and affidavit of defense, the facts showing the change of beneficiary and payment to the new beneficiaries, which it alleged was in accordance with the contract contained in the benefit certificate and the constitution and laws of the organization. The case was heard by the Supreme Court on motion for judgment against the defendant for failure to file a good and sufficient affidavit of defense; and judgment was entered for $3,000 with interest. The Court of Appeals of the District reversed this judgment, but later granted a rehearing, the order reciting:\n'The question to be argued is this: Had the beneficiary of the certificate a vested interest in the same that could not be divested by the issue of a substitute certificate without the surrender of the original and without the consent of the beneficiary named in the original certificate?'\n\n Upon the rehearing the judgment of the lower court was affirmed. 45 App. D. C. 260. The case comes here on writ of certiorari under section 251 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1159 [Comp. St. 1916,  1228]).\n The benefit certificate provided, among other things, that the corporation will pay 'out of its Widows and Orphans' Benefit Fund to Sue B. Behrend (wife) a sum not exceeding three thousand dollars in accordance with and under the provisions of the laws governing said fund, upon satisfactory evidence of the death of said member, and upon the surrender of this certificate; provided that said member is in good standing in this order at the time of his death, and provided also that this certificate shall not have been surrendered by said member and another certificate issued at his request, in accordance with the laws of this order.' On the back of said certificate appears the following:\n'Form for Change of Beneficiary.\n\n'_____ Council No. ___, R. A.\n\n'To _____, Sup. Sec., S. C. R. A.: I herewith surrender and return to the Supreme Council \n\n[247 U.S. 394, 397]\n\u00a0\n of the Royal Arcanum, the within benefit certificate No. ___, and direct that a new one be issued to me, payable to _____, residing at _____, related to me as _____.\n\n ________.\n (Member will write his name in full.)\n'Attest:\n\n'[Seal of Sub. Council.]\n\n'________, Secretary.'\n\n The general laws of the order, in force at latest when the new certificate was issued, provide that a member in good standing may at any time make 'a written surrender of his benefit certificate, and direct that a new certificate be issued to him, payable to such beneficiary or beneficiaries as such member may designate' and that the issue of such new certificate shall cancel all previous certificates. They also provide that, in case 'a benefit certificate is lost or beyond a member's control,' he may, upon making satisfactory proof of the fact by affidavit or otherwise and paying the required fee of fifty cents, 'in writing, surrender all claim thereto, and direct that a new certificate be issued to him, payable to the same or a new beneficiary or beneficiaries.' These conditions were complied with before the new certificate making the son and daughter beneficiaries was issued.\n Act of Congress January 26, 1887, c. 46,  6 (24 Stat. 367), provided that each life insurance company doing business within the district should attach to each ploicy a copy of the application 'so that the whole contract may appear in said application and policy.' Section 657 of the District of Columbia Code, as amended June 30, 1902 (32 Stat. 534, c. 1329 ), extended the provision to benefit orders and associations and declared that, in case of failure to furnish a copy of the application, 'no defense shall be allowed to such policy on account of anything contained in, or omitted from, such application.' The \n\n[247 U.S. 394, 398]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals decided that Mrs. Behrend acquired a vested interest in the benefit certificate which could not be divested by the issue of a substitute certificate without the surrender of the original and without her consent as beneficiary; that the rights of the parties were governed by the laws of the District of Columbia; that the benefit certificate was an insurance policy within the meaning of both the above acts; that the order was an assessment insurance company and as such came within the scope of both acts, so that the fact that the benefit certificate was issued before the amendment of 1902 was immaterial; that it did not appear that there had been attached to the certificate a copy of the application therefor; that the failure to annex the application precluded allowing as a defense any matter not appearing on the face of the benefit certificate; that the change of beneficiary was such a defense; and that since matters found only in the application and laws of the association could not be availed of, the court must 'look solely to the terms of the contract, t at is, to the terms of this so-called benefit certificate, to determine the measure of the insured's rights to change the beneficiary'; and that by its terms there was no such right.\n This court held in Washington Central Bank v. Hume, \n128 \nU.S. 195, 206\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 41, that under the ordinary policy of life insurance, when no right is reserved to surrender the policy or to change beneficiaries, the beneficiary named therein acquires, at the moment it is issued, a vested right which cannot be affected by any act of the insured subsequent to the execution of the policy. The rule there declared was deemed by the Court of Appeals to control the case at bar. But it was not applicable, because the contract sued on was a benefit certificate of a fraternal benefit association, not an ordinary policy of life insurance, and also because the benefit certificate on its face reserves the right to change beneficiaries. \n\n[247 U.S. 394, 399]\n\u00a0\n First. The difference between ordinary life insurance and that furnished by the fraternal benefit societies has been universally recognized in legislation and is a matter of common knowledge. The differences in the legal incidents of these different forms of protection have been illustrated by numerous decisions. The difference in respect to the insured's right to change the beneficiary has been frequently commented on and is firmly established. In the absence of a special provision of law or of a rule of the association to the contrary, the naming of a person as beneficiary in the benefit certificate of a fraternal benefit association confers not a vested right, but an expectancy merely which may be defeated at any time by act of the insured member.2. A different case is presented where the insured has contracted with the beneficiary that he shall remain such. A contract of that nature may be enforced by appropriate proceeding if \n\n[247 U.S. 394, 400]\n\u00a0\n consistent with the general law and with the laws of the association. \n3\n But the remedy to enforce rights arising out of such a contract would obviously not be a suit, like that at bar, upon the certificate. Nor is it contended that Behrend made any such contract concerning the certificate with his wife. The mere fact that she paid some, and possibly all, of the assessment, prior to the change of beneficiary, even if paid out of her separate estate, raises no legal claim. \n4\n Perhaps there was not even a moral claim; since throughout the period during which she paid assessments, she enjoyed the full protection which the order agreed to furnish; and for this alone payments were made. Under the form of insurance furnished by fraternal beneficial associations no reserve is accumulated.\n Second. The certificate, on its face, expressed not an unconditional promise to make payment to the wife therein named, but a conditional promise to pay provided the 'certificate shall not have been surrendered by said member and another certificate issued at his request, in accordance with the laws of this order.' The plaintiff alleged that the certificate had not been surrendered and \n\n[247 U.S. 394, 401]\n\u00a0\n that she had not been requested to surrender or deliver up the same for change of beneficiary. The latter allegation is denied by the affidavit of defense and the statements therein contained must be taken as true. But the fact is not material. As indicated by the printed 'Form for Change of Beneficiary' indorsed on the certificate, which refers to both 'surrender and return,' the requirement of a surrender does not necessarily imply a return to the order of the original paper called the benefit certificate. Furthermore, requirements of that character are made for the protection of the society and, if complied with to its satisfaction or if waived by it during the lifetime of the insured, cannot be availed of to support the claim of a former beneficiary. \n5\n It is unnecessary therefore to determine whether, under this form of certificate, the burden rested upon the plaintiff to prove, as she alleged, that she had remained the beneficiary. As the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed for the reasons stated above, we express no opinion upon other questions argued by counsel and, in part, passed upon below.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] District Code,  749 (Act of Congress March 3, 1897, c. 382,  1, 29 Stat. 630). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Slaughter v.

SMYTH(1918)\nNo. 107\nArgued: January 2, 1918Decided: January 28, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 594, 595]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John J. McCall, of Albany, N. Y., and James E. Watson, of Rushville, Ind., for appellant.\n Mr. Harry V. Borst, of Amsterdam, N. Y., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We shall designate the parties as they were in the trial court, the plaintiff in error as defendant and the defendant in error as plaintiff.\n This is a suit to enjoin an increase of assessment upon a certificate- we shall call it a policy-of insurance on the life of the plaintiff, issued by the defendant. The asserted claim, approved by the lower courts, is that the defendant is estopped to demand such increased payment, or to cancel the policy for failure to pay it, for the reason that at the time plaintiff's policy was delivered to him there was handed to him by the secretary of the local section a pamphlet which purported to be a copy of the 'Constitution and General Laws' of the insurance section or 'Endowment Rank' of the defendant, which were then in force. In this copy of the general laws-by-laws-article IV, section 1, reads:\n'Each member ... shall pay ... a monthly assessment, as provided in the following table, and shall continue to pay the same amount thereafter as long as he remains a member of the Endowment Rank.'\n\n This provision, it is contended, became a part of the contract of insurance with the plaintiff, which could not be changed without his consent, and made unlawful any increase in his assessment. The defense is that power was given to the defendant by its charter to change its by-laws; \n\n[245 U.S. 594, 596]\n\u00a0\n that by provisions in his policy and in his application for it, the plaintiff was notified and charged with knowledge of this fact; and that the increase of assessment complained of was duly authorized pursuant to the terms of this grant of power.\n In the disposition which we make of the case the further claim of the defendant, that the by-law relied upon by the plaintiff had been amended before the policy was issued to him, becomes unimportant.\n The facts of the case before us make it clear that it must be ruled by the decision of this court in Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias, v. Mims, \n241 U.S. 574\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 702, L. R. A. 1916F, 919.\n The defendant is the same fraternal insurance corporation which was plaintiff in error in that case, and its corporate history there detailed need not be repeated here.\n The plaintiff in this case (as in the other) was a member of the fourth class of the 'Endowment Rank,' and his policy for $3,000 was delivered to him on November 26, 1889, upon an application filed the 26th of the preceding month. He paid a monthly assessment of $3 until 1894 when it was increased to $3.15, which he paid until 1901 when it was increased to $4.80, which he paid until 1910 when he received a notice of an increase to $14.70, which he refused to pay and made the basis of his claim in this suit.\n In the Mims Case the original policy was issued in 1879, but was surrendered for another in May, 1885, which contained, as the report shows, the same provisions, in almost the same words, as in the Smyth policy. When it was issued the by-law on which the plaintiff relies in this case was confess dly in full force, so that if it be admitted that this by-law was in the form which the plaintiff claims it was represented to him to be at the time his policy was issued, nevertheless his position would be precisely that of Mims.\n Two increases of assessment made prior to the one ob- \n\n[245 U.S. 594, 597]\n\u00a0\n jected to were paid by Mims 'under protest' and by Smyth without objection. The cases are on all fours one with the other and the decision of the earlier one, which it should be noted was rendered since the decision in the Circuit Court of Appeals, must be accepted as ruling this case on the merits as it also rules against the motion by the defendant in error to dismiss. Texas & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Hill, \n237 U.S. 208\n, and also 215, 35 Sup. Ct. 575.\n It results that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be Reversed. \n\n\n\n","158":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUTTON v. ENGLISH(1918)\nNo. 330\nArgued: April 10, 1917Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Allen G. Fisher, of Chadron, Neb., for appellants.\n Mr. Cecil H. Smith, of Sherman, Tex., for appellees. \n\n[246 U.S. 199, 200]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States District Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a bill in equity brought by appellants, and certified in substance that the dismissal was based upon the ground that the bill and its exhibits disclosed no infraction of any right arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States; that the matter was cognizable solely in the county court of Collin county, Texas, a court of probate jurisdiction; and that the record disclosed no diversity of citizenship upon which the federal jurisdiction might be based, because it appeared that one of the defendants who should be considered as a plaintiff and the remainder of the defendants were in fact citizens of the same state.\n The case comes to us by direct appeal, upon the jurisdictional question only, under section 238, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [Comp. St. 1916,  1215]).\n The bill sets up diversity of citizenship and the fact that the amount in controversy exceeds that which is requisite for jurisdiction. It asserts no federal right. It alleges that the plaintiffs (seven in number) are citizens of states other than Texas, while of those named as defendants six (including Cora D. Spencer) are citizens of Texas and residents of Collin county in the Sherman division of the Eastern district of that state, and the seventh is a municipal corporation of that state.\n The averments of the bill are in substance as follows: That about the year 1866 Moses Hubbard and Mary Jane Hubbard, his wife, settled on a parcel of real estate in Collin county, Texas, and from that time continuously until the dates of their respective deaths lived as citizens and inhabitants of that county, and during their joint lifetime cohabited together as husband and wife; that the said Moses died in 1906, leaving his wife surviving, but no descendant or other heir; that she died in 1914, without children or husband, but leaving her surviving \n\n[246 U.S. 199, 201]\n\u00a0\n the following heirs at law: A sister, Rachael E. Kirtley, two brothers, Albert E. Sutton and Delana M. Sutton, and the children of a deceased brother, Lewis Sutton, namely, Cora D. Spencer, Elizabeth E. Davis, Ida Krickbaum, George D. Sutton, and Lewis Sutton, Jr., and that afterwards the last named died intestate, unmarried, and without descendants, leaving his mother, Helen M. Marshall, and his sisters and brother, Cora D. Spencer, Elizabeth E. Davis, Ida Krickbaum, and George D. Sutton, as his heirs. The persons named are stated to be the only heirs at law of Mary Jane and Moses Hubbard. All of them are plaintiffs in the suit except Cora D. Spencer, who is made a defendant.\n The bill alleges, further: That Moses and Mary Jane Hubbard accumulated community property, real and personal (specified in the bill), of the value of about $100,000 situate in Collin and Denton counties, all of which descended to the said Mary Jane as survivor of the community.\n That in the year 1897 Moses Hubbard, being then 'subject to a mania or unsound idea relative to the memory of his deceased daughter,' attempted a disposal of his wife's community property by a purported will ( executed by his wife also and in form a joint and several will), by the terms of which it was attempted to establish in the community property after it should become separate property of Mary Jane Hubbard a certain charitable trust in perpetuity, in the name of the deceased daughter. Plaintiffs allege that this trust was void, for various reasons specified, and that if the instrument had any effect in law it created a naked trust whereof the said Mary Jane Hubbard was sole beneficiary. That afterwards and in the month of January, 1913, the defendan English, joining with himself the defendants Finley, Robinson, and Foster, acting as trustees of the charity, filed a petition in the district court of Collin county against* \n\n[246 U.S. 199, 202]\n\u00a0\n Mary Jane Hubbard and another, wherein it was alleged that the will of 1897 was a joint will, constituting an agreement binding upon both Moses and Mary Jane Hubbard, under which she received rights, emoluments, and privileges which she would not have had otherwise, and that she had accepted the will, and at all times since its probating had accepted and exercised those rights, privileges, and emoluments, by reason whereof the will was irrevocable by her, and that a trust was thereby created in behalf of the said English, Finley, Robinson, and Foster; that said petition prayed for a citation thereon and judgment that a trust be declared in favor of the petitioners; but plaintiffs herein allege that no citation was issued, that Mary Jane Hubbard had no notice of the proceedings, and that she was deceived into signing a purported waiver and disclaimer which was without consideration and void; that the judgment was never given by any judge or person possessing judicial power within the state of Texas; and that the petition was in effect an application for the construction of the paper as the will of Moses Hubbard, of which the district court had not jurisdiction in the first instance, and for which construction there was then and yet pending in the county probate court of Collin county a petition signed by the said purported trustees whereupon the judgment of the said county court would be binding upon them without the assumption of power in the district court of said county.\n That in addition to the community property, Mary Jane Hubbard accumulated real and personal property amounting in value to about $18,000 and that in her last sickness, while she was clouded in her intellect and was not of sound or disposing mind or memory, she was unduly influenced by the defendant English to execute an instrument in the form of a will purporting to dispose of her accumulations and separate property, by the 12th paragraph of which she gave and bequeathed all the res- \n\n[246 U.S. 199, 203]\n\u00a0\n idue of her property to her niece Cora D. Spencer; that this will 'ought to be annulled and set aside and held for naught; nevertheless, these plaintiffs do not desire to interfere with the distribution made by the defendant, Clayton, purporting to act as executor of said will, but they bring this bill for the purpose of having it annulled to the extent only that the twelfth paragraph ... be decreed ... not to be a testamentary disposition of that portion of her separate estate which had once been community estate of the said Moses Hubbard and Mary Jane Hubbard'; and that the community property should be decreed to pass to the plaintiffs pursuant to the statutes of Texas as estate not devised or bequeathed, and should be divided among the plaintiffs in certain proportions specified.\n The bill avers that the defendant English has usurped and taken possession of seven tracts of real estate and certain moneys, notes, and credits particularly described, and has rented the lands and converted to his own use their annual profit.\n The prayer is that the defendants English, Finley, Robinson, and Foster account concerning the rents, issues, profits and income of said real estate and personal property; that the joint will of 1897 and every claim, judgment, or right based thereon be set aside and held for naught; that the supposed will signed by Mary Jane Hubbard, dated in 1914, and the twelfth clause thereof be canceled and set aside and annulled; and that the property described in the bill and the earnings and rentals thereof be decreed to be the property of the plaintiffs as heirs at law of Mary Jane Hubbard, deceased, and be partitioned between them. There is also a prayer for general relief.\n The objects of the suit, in their logical order, appear to be as follows: (1) To treat the joint will of 1897 as inefficacious to dispo e of the community property, either \n\n[246 U.S. 199, 204]\n\u00a0\n because this became the separate property of Mary Jane Hubbard at her husband's death, or because of Moses Hubbard's mental incapacity or the illegality of the terms of the trust; (2) to set aside a judgment said to have been obtained in the Collin county district court by defendant English and others, devisees under the joint will, establishing their title to the community property as against Mary Jane Hubbard; (3) to have her will annulled at least to the extent that the twelfth paragraph, which gives and bequeaths all the residue of her property to Cora D. Spencer, be decreed not to be a testamentary disposition of that portion of the estate of testatrix which had been community property; and (4) that the community property, having thus been shown to have been separate estate of Mary Jane Hubbard and not to have been devised by her, be decreed to have passed to the plaintiffs as her heirs at law and be partitioned between them.\n Upon this statement, it will be apparent that the court below erred in holding, as it did, that the defendant Cora D. Spencer should be treated as one of the plaintiffs and aligned with them for the purpose of determining the question of diversity of citizenship. Provided plaintiffs attained their first three objects, her interest would be the same as theirs with respect to the prayer for partition; but before this result could be reached plaintiffs must prevail as to their third object, and with respect to this her interest was altogether adverse to theirs. Therefore she was properly made a party defendant, that being her attitude towards the actual and substantial controversy. See Removal Cases, 100 \nU.S. 457, 468; Pacific R. R. v. Ketchum, \n101 U.S. 289\n, 298; Barney v. Latham, \n103 U.S. 205\n, 211; Harter v. Kernochan, \n103 U.S. 562\n, 566; Helm v. Zarecor, \n222 \nU.S. 32, 36\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 10.\n This brings us to the question whether the subject matter of the suit is within the jurisdiction of a court of the United States. \n\n[246 U.S. 199, 205]\n\u00a0\n By a series of decisions in this court it has been established that since it does not pertain to the general jurisdiction of a court of equity to set aside a will or the probate thereof, or to administer upon the estates of decedents in rem, matters of this character are not within the ordinary equity jurisdiction of the federal courts; that as the authority to make wills is derived from the states, and the requirement of probate is but a regulation to make a will effective, matters of strict probate are not within the jurisdiction of courts of the United States; that where a state, by statute or custom, gives to parties interested the right to bring an action or suit inter partes, either at law or in equity, to annul a will or to set aside the probate, the courts of the United States, where diversity of citizenship and a sufficient amount in controversy appear, can enforce the same remedy, but that this relates only to independent suits, and not to procedure merely incidental or ancillary to the probate; and, further, that questions relating to the interests of heirs, devisees, or legatees, or trusts affecting such interests, which may be determined without interfering with probate or assuming general administration, are within the jurisdiction of the federal courts where diversity of citizenship exists and the requisite amount is in controversy. Broderick's Will, 21 Wall. 503, 509, 512; Ellis v. Davis, \n109 \nU.S. 485, 494\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 327, et seq.; Farrell v. O'Brien, \n199 \nU.S. 89, 110\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 727; Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank Co., \n215 \nU.S. 33, 43\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 10.\n It is the contention of appellants that the United States District Court had original jurisdiction of this cause (there being diversity of citizenship and a sufficient amount in controversy) because jurisdiction over a suit in equity of the same character would have existed in the co nty or district courts of the state.\n In order to test this, we must consider the nature and extent of the jurisdiction of the courts referred to, as established by the Constitution of Texas and statutes \n\n[246 U.S. 199, 206]\n\u00a0\n passed in pursuance thereof (Vernon's Sayles' Tex. Civ. Stats. 1914), the material provisions of which are as follows: Under Const. art. 5,  6, and Stats. arts. 3206, 1763, 1764, 1766, and 1771, the county court has the general jurisdiction of a probate court, with power to probate wills, grant letters testamentary or of administration, settle accounts of executors and administrators, etc.; exclusive original jurisdiction in civil cases when the matter in controversy exceeds $200 and does not exceed $500, and concurrent jurisdiction with the district court when the matter in controversy exceeds $500 and does not exceed $1,000, but no jurisdiction of suits for the recovery of land or for the enforcement of liens upon land; and general authority to hear and determine any case, either of law or equity, but subject to certain limitations including those just mentioned. Under Const. art. 5,  8, and Stats. arts. 1705, 1706, 1712, and 3207, the district court has 'appellate jurisdiction and general control in probate matters over the county court established in each county, for the probating of wills, granting letters testamentary or of administration, settling the accounts of executors and administrators,' etc.; also 'original jurisdiction and general control over executors and administrators under such regulations as may be prescribed by law'; original jurisdiction of all suits for the trial of title to land and for the enforcement of liens thereon, and of all suits, without regard to any distinction between law and equity, when the matter in controversy exceeds $ 500; and, subject to limitations not now pertinent, general jurisdiction over any cause cognizable by courts either of law or equity.\n It will be seen that the contention must be overruled at once, so far as concerns the equitable jurisdiction of the county court, because in the case before us the title to land is involved and the matter in controversy exceeds $1,000. The jurisdiction of the district court is not thus \n\n[246 U.S. 199, 207]\n\u00a0\n limited, and, under local decisions (Japhet v. Pullen, 63 Tex. Civ. App. 157, 133 S. W. 441, 445, and cases cited), it may be assumed that an independent suit in equity could be entertained by that court, and therefore-under the decisions of this court to which reference has been made-might be brought in the United States District Court, for the purpose of construing the joint will of Moses and Mary Jane Hubbard as inefficacious to dispose of the community property, and to set aside, for fraud or on other grounds, the judgment recovered by the defendants English and others against Mary Jane Hubbard establishing their title to that property; and that, if the title of complainants as heirs at law of Mary Jane Hubbard could thus be shown, the jurisdiction to partition the property would follow as of course. But, as already pointed out, even could complainants succeed in showing that Mary Jane Hubbard at the time of her death was entitled to the community property, her will giving all the residue of her property to Cora D. Spencer still stands in the way of their succeeding to it as heirs at law, and hence their prayer to have that will annulled with respect to the residuary clause is essential to their right to any relief in the suit.\n But it is established by repeated decisions of the Supreme Court of Texas that under the present Constitution the district courts have no jurisdiction to annul by an original proceeding the action of a county court in probating a will, their jurisdiction in the premises being confined to a review by appeal or certiorari, which are in effect but a continuation of the probate proceedings. It is further held that under a statutory provision (article 5699) reading, 'Any person interested in any will which shall have been probated under the laws of thi state may institute suit in the proper court to contest the validity thereof, within four years after such will shall have been admitted to probate, and not afterward,' such a suit \n\n[246 U.S. 199, 208]\n\u00a0\n must be instituted in the court in which the will was admitted to probate, that is to say, in the county court and that it calls for an exercise of original probate jurisdiction. Franks v. Chapman, 60 Tex. 46; Franks v. Chapman, 61 Tex. 576, 579, 582, 583; Heath v. Layne, 62 Tex. 686; Fisher v. Wood, 65 Tex. 199, 204. And see Dew v. Dew, 23 Tex. Civ. App. 676, 57 S. W. 926; Hilgers v. Hilgers, 159 S. W. 851.\n The present suit being, in an essential feature, a suit to annul the will of Mary Jane Hubbard, and a proceeding of this character being by the laws of Texas merely supplemental to the proceedings for probate of the will and cognizable only by the probate court, it follows from what we have said that the controversy is not within the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTALLEY v. BURGESS(1918)\nNo. 157\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. H. B. Talley, of Tulsa, Okl., pro se.\n Messrs. Thomas D. Lyons and Luther James, both of Tulsa, Okl., for defendants in error. \n\n[246 U.S. 104, 105]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by H. B. Talley in the district court of Tulsa county, Oklahoma, for the specific performance of a certain contract entered into by Nora B. Burgess, mother and guardian of the defendant in error, Daniel S. Burgess, a minor, with the law firm of Talley & Harnage. Harnage refusing to join in this action it was brought by Talley alone. Harnage was made a defendant to the suit. The petition sets forth that the contract was for professional services in consideration of which the attorneys were to receive a one-half interest in the one-third interest of the defendant in error, Daniel S. Burgess, in certain Cherokee allotted land. The contract was made on May 11, 1906, and the allotment in question was embraced in a selection of land made by Nora B. Burgess as administratrix of the estate of John S. Burgess, the latter, the father of Daniel S. Burgess, having died without having selected or received an allotment.\n The petition states that on May 11, 1906, Talley & Harnage entered into contracts with the other heirs of John S. Burgess similar to those entered into with the defendant in error.\n The land in controversy, it is set forth, was originally allotted to defendant's mother, an intermarried Cherokee Indian, but the attorneys procured a cancellation of that allotment and then another allotment of the same in the name of the defendant's father, this allotment being selected by the administratrix in his right. The petition avers that defendant's share had been set apart to him, and that at the time of the beginning of the suit he was in the quiet enjoyment thereof. The district cou t appointed a guardian ad litem for the defendant in error, Daniel Burgess, and a motion was filed, treated in the courts below as a demurrer, and the trial court held that \n\n[246 U.S. 104, 106]\n\u00a0\n under the statutes of the United States the guardian could not dispose of the ward's property, as she had undertaken to do, except under order of the proper United States court on petition filed for that purpose; and that the attempted sale by the guardian without court procedure was void. On error the Supreme Court of Oklahoma affirmed the judgment of the district court of Tulsa county. 46 Okl. 550, 149 Pac. 120.\n The case as presented in this court involves two questions:\n\n\n (1)\n Whether the Act of April 26, 1906, c. 1876, 34 Stat. 137, is applicable to the present suit.\n\n\n (2)\n If applicable, whether conveyances of the kind here involved, of the ward's interest in the allotted lands, could be made by his guardian without an order of court.\n The land was allotted under the Cherokee Agreement, 32 Stat. 716, which provides in section 11 for allotment by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes to each citizen of the Cherokee Tribe, after approval by the Secretary of the Interior of the enrollment provided, of land equal in value to 110 acres, to be selected by each allottee so as to include his improvements. Section 13 provides for the designation of a homestead out of said allotment equal in value to forty acres of the lands of the Cherokee Nation, to be inalienable during the lifetime of the allottee, not exceeding twenty-one years from the date of the allotment. Section 14 provides that lands allotted to citizens shall not in any manner be encumbered, taken, or sold to secure or satisfy any debt or obligation, or be alienated by the allottee or his heirs, before the expiration of five years from the date of the ratification of the act. Section 15 provides that all lands allotted to the members of the tribe, except such as are set aside for a homestead, shall be alienable five years after issuance of patent. Section 20 provides:\n'If any person whose name appears upon the roll pre- \n\n[246 U.S. 104, 107]\n\u00a0\n pared as herein provided shall have died subsequent to the first day of September nineteen hundred and two, and before receiving his allottment, the lands to which such person would have been cntitled if living shall be allotted in his name, and shall, with his proportionate share of other tribal property, descend to his heirs according to the laws of descent and distribution as provided in chapter forty-nine of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas: Provided, that the allotment thus to be made shall be selected by a duly appointed administrator or executor. If, however, such administrator or executor be not duly and expeditiously appointed, or fails to act promptly when appointed, or for any other cause such selection be not so made within a reasonable and proper time, the Dawes Commission shall designate the lands thus to be allotted.'\n\n It may be regarded as established that the Cherokee Agreement, in view of the sections just considered, imposes no restrictions upon alienation of the interest in the land thus going to the heir, other than that of minority. Mullen v. United States, \n224 U.S. 448\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 494; Skelton v. Dill, \n235 U.S. 206\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 60; Adkins v. Arnold, \n235 U.S. 417\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 118. However, the agreement upon which this suit was brought was made after the passage of the Act of April 26, 1906, a statute with which this court has had occasion to deal in recent decisions. Its scope and purpose were dealt with in Brader v. James, \n246 U.S. 88\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 285, 62 L. Ed. --, just decided. That act, as its title indicates, is a comprehensive one for the final disposition of the affairs of the Five Civilized Tribes. Section 22 provides:\n'That the adult heirs of any deceased Indian of either of the Five Civilized Tribes whose selection has been made, or to whom a deed or patent has been issued for his or her share of the land of the tribe o which he or she belongs or belonged, may sell and convey the lands inherited from such decedent; and if there be both adult \n\n[246 U.S. 104, 108]\n\u00a0\n and minor heirs of such decedent, then such minors may join in a sale of such lands by a guardian duly appointed by the proper United States Court for the Indian Territory. And in case of the organization of a state or territory, then by a proper court of the county in which said minor or minors may reside or in which said real estate is situated, upon an order of such court made upon petition filed by guardian. All conveyances made under this provision by heirs who are full-blood Indians are to be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe.'\n\n It is contended that this section applies only to heirs of a deceased Indian whose selection has been made by himself, or to whom a deed or patent has been issued for his or her share of the land of the tribe to which the decedent belonged. But in our view Congress in the passage of section 22 had in contemplation that Indians duly enrolled and entitled to share in the tribal property and lands might die before receiving the allotment to which he, or she, was entitled. Congress had made provision in section 20 of the Cherokee Agreement that such land might be allotted in the name of the deceased, and should with the proportionate share of the other tribal property descend to the heirs of the one who would have been entitled, if living. It also provided that the selection for a decedent should be made by a duly appointed administrator or executor, or, in default of such selection, the Dawes Commission should designate the land to be allotted. We think minor heirs who thus receive lands are within the meaning and purpose of the statute, as much so as they would have been had the land been selected by the ancestor in his lifetime.\n Section 22 being applicable to a conveyance of a minor's lands in the situation here presented, we come to the question whether the guardian could legally make disposition thereof without an order of the court of the United \n\n[246 U.S. 104, 109]\n\u00a0\n States for the Indian Territory. It is contended that section 22, as enacted, makes the requirement as to the order of the court applicable only after organization of a state or territory. Literally read the statute might lend itself to such interpretation. But minor heirs are required to join in the sale of the lands by a guardian duly appointed by the proper United States Court for the Indian Territory. The next sentence specifically provides that the order of sale must be made upon petition filed by the guardian in the proper court of the county in which the land is situated. These provisions, read together, and construing the statute in the light of the purpose to be accomplished, we think, require court approval in both instances. It is not denied that the United States Court for the Territory would have had jurisdiction of a proceeding by a guardian for an order to sell the ward's interests in the lands. See Robinson v. Long Gas Co. (C. C. A. 8 Cir.) 221 Fed. 398, 136 C. C. A. 642, where the applicable statutes are set out and considered.\n We cannot believe that Congress intended after territorial or state organization to require the guardian to procure the approval and order of a court before disposition of the ward's lands, and before the organization of a territory or state to permit the guardian, who was required to be appointed by the United States Court for the Indian Territory, which court had jurisdiction over the sale of the lands of the ward upon application of the guardian, to dispose of the ward's interests in lands without judicial approval. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma did not err in holding that the Act of April 26, 1906, was applicable, and that the interests in the lands of the ward could only be sold with the approval of the United States Court for the Indian Territory, and its judgment is, therefore\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEMPEL v. U S(1918)\nNo. 29\nArgued: November 5, 1917Decided: December 9, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[248 U.S. 121, 122]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Timothy F. Mullen and Thomas B. Lantry, both of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 121, 123]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Chicago river, its branches and forks lie wholly within the state of Illinois. \n1\n Their aggregate length is about 35 miles. Originally the stream was a sluggish creek, nearly stagnant during much of the year and, in part, navigable only for rowboats and canoes or for \n\n[248 U.S. 121, 124]\n\u00a0\n floating of logs. The United States surveyed the river in 1837, but made no improvement above its mouth until 1896. Before the latter date, however, extensive improvements had been made from time to time by the city and by riparian owners. The river had become the inner harbor of Chicago and, measured by its tonnage, was one of the most important waterways of the globe. In number of arrivals and departures of vessels it led all the harbors of the United States. In tonnage it was second only to New York. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n In 1896 Congress made an appropriation 'for improving the Chicago river, in Illinois, from its mouth to the stock yards on the South branch and to Belmont avenue on the North branch, as far as may be permitted by existing docks and wharves, to be dredged to admit passage by vessles drawing sixteen feet of water.' Act of June 3, 1896, c. 314 (29 Stat. 202, 228). This act was amended by the Act of June 4, 1897, c. 2 (30 Stat. 11, 47), which, as interpreted by the War Department, permitted a slight widening of the stream in certain places. The General Assembly of Illinois by resolution of April 22-23, 1897, gave assent to the United States acquiring by purchase or condemnation 'all lands necessary for widening the Chicago river and its branches.' In 1899 Congress directed a survey with a view to creating a deeper channel and adopting 21 feet 'as the project depth for the improvement in lieu of that fixed by the Act of June third, eighteen hundred and ninety-six.' Act of March 3, 1899, c. 425 (30 Stat. 1121, 1156). No widening beyond the banks of the de jure stream was specifically authorized by this act, nor by any subsequent act. From time to time other appropriations were made by Congress for these improvements of the river, and work \n\n[248 U.S. 121, 125]\n\u00a0\n was carried on thereunder. \n3\n About 12.5 miles of the river was improved by the government; and of this about 5 miles consisted of that part of the North branch which lies between the main river and Belmont avenue.\n Early in 1899 Tempel became the owner of certain land on the bank of the North branch below Belmont avenue. He leased his land for a brickyard; and by the terms of the lease the lessee was permitted to dredge the bottom of the river in front of the premises for the purpose of making brick from the clay thereunder. But the lessee was directed not to interfere with the upland; and he covenanted to deliver up the premises in the condition in which they were demised. Nevertheless, from time to time during a period of five years between 1889 and 1899, the lessee dug away, to a depth of from 6 to 14 feet, a large strip of the upland, extending in some places to a considerable width. In its natural state the stream opposite the plaintiff's property varied in width from probably 50 to 150 feet, and could be used only for floating logs and for travel by rowboats or canoes; but before 1889 riparian owners had dug a channel and possibly greatly widened the stream, and schooners navigated to a point beyond Belmont avenue. Between 1890 and 1899 boats drawing 5 to 8 feet of water were navigating the North branch up to Belmont avenue. In 1896 the river in front of Tempel's property was in varying depths of from 6 to 14 or 15 feet.\n The United States did not do any dredging in front of \n\n[248 U.S. 121, 126]\n\u00a0\n Tempel's property until 1899. Then it dredged a channel to the depth of 17 feet, about 30 feet wide-the excavation being made wholly in the then bed of the stream as submerged. It next dredging there was in 1909 when this channel was deepened to 21 feet and widened to 60 feet, the excavation being again made wholly in the then bed of the stream as submerged. All of the dredging, both in 1899 and in 1909, which was not within the bed of the river in its natural state, was done within the limits of the strip of upland which had been submerged through the dredging done by the lessee prior to 1899. During the period from 1889 to 1899, the stream in front of Tempel's premises was in constant and increasing use for the purpose of public navigation. The government does not appear to have had knowledge of the fact that dredging had been done before 1899 by the lessee without the consent of Tempel or that the river had been widened by excavation. The reports of the Secretary of War show that he never specifically authorized, for the purpose of widening the river, the appropriation of any of the property herein involved and that the government believed, when it dredged in front of Tempel's property in 1899 and again in 1909, that the submerged land, in which the dredging was done, was either a part of the natural bed of the river, or that it had been dedicated by the owner for purposes of navigation, or that it had in some other manner become a part of the de jure stream. \n4\n No \n\n[248 U.S. 121, 127]\n\u00a0\n objection was made by Tempel, until 1910, to the use, for navigation, of the river in front of his property; and he did not file any complaint as to the dredging of 1899. He had no knowledge, until 1910, of the dredging which had been done by his lessee, nor of that done by the government.\n Promptly after learning of the dredging, Tempel demanded of the government possession of that part of the land submerged which had formerly constituted a part of his upland. The demand was refused; and in 1911 he brought, in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois, this suit, under the Tucker Act (Judicial Code,  24, par. 20; Comp. St. 1916,  991 \n\n[248 U.S. 121, 20]\n\u00a0\n), to recover the value of property which he claimed had been taken by the government. The complaint alleged that the river in front of his premises was, at the time he acquired the same and theretofore, a creek used only for surface drainage and was 'not a navigable stream either in law or in fact'; that the government 'in the latter part of the year 1909 completely excavated a channel through the same' for the purpose of making said North branch navigable; and that it holds possession thereof by virtue of the resolution of the General Assembly of Illinois above referred to; and that the reasonable value of the property taken was $10,000. The complaint did not refer either to the dredging done before 1889, when Tempel acquired the property, or to that done between 1889 and 1899 by Tempel's lessee, or to that done in 1899 by the government. The answer denied that the stream in front of- \n\n[248 U.S. 121, 128]\n\u00a0\n *Tempel's land was nonnavigable when he purchased it or theretofore; asserted that all excavations by the government were made in the center of the stream and were for the purpose of improving navigation; and denied that it had taken any of Tempel's property under the resolution of the Illinois Assembly or otherwise.\n The trial court found as a fact:\n'That by reason of the changes in said river as aforesaid, the difference between the value of the premises of the petitioner at the time when he purchased the same as aforesaid, and the value of the same at the time that the demand as hereinbefore set forth was made, less the cost of reclaiming the same, were he entitled to make reclamation thereof, is $7,547.00.'\n\n As conclusions of law the trial court found that the North branch was navigable in its natural state; that it was navigable in fact as early as 1889; that Tempel, having failed to complain of the use by the public of the stream in front of his property for a period of at least ten years prior to the first dredging by the United States, was estopped from thereafter disputing the navigability of the river; and that the river being then a navigable stream, the dredging of the bed in 1899 and in 1909 did not constitute a taking of Tempel's property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. Judgment was entered for the United States; and the case comes here on writ of error.\n First. This is a suit, like United States v. Lynah, \n188 U.S. 445\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 349, and United States v. Cress, \n243 U.S. 316\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 380, to recover the value of property taken by the government in making a river improvement. The property alleged to have been taken is land, part of which lies within the 30-foot channel first dredged by the government in 1899; the balance within the additional 30 feet dredged by it in 1909, when the channel was widened to 60 feet; and all of which formed part of the river bed and was submerged when the government commenced its improvement and has been since. But the property of Tempel, \n\n[248 U.S. 121, 129]\n\u00a0\n if any, which the government has taken is only the right to keep his land submerged, to navigate over it, and to improve it further for purposes of navigation. This right in the land the government claimed and claims that it already possessed at the time when it dredged on the property in question; and it is the same right which the government possesses in that portion of the present river bed lying within the original meander lines and which originally constituted the whole river bed. Under the law of Illinois, neither the United States nor the state owns the lands under a navigable river. Riparian owners own the fee to the middle of the stream ( St. Louis v. Rutz, \n138 \nU.S. 226, 242\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 337), subject to the paramount right of the government to use the same and to make improvements therein for purposes of navigation, without the payment of compensation (West Chicago Railroad v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 506, 520\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 518; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 62\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 667; Willink v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 572, 580\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 422). Included in such permissible improvement is dredging for the purpose of deepening the channel. Lewis Blue Point Oyster Co. v. Briggs, \n229 U.S. 82\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 679, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 232. It is only this right to use and improve for purposes of navigation that the government claims here, a right which the government undoubtedly possessed, if the land in question had been a part of the bed of the de jure stream, as was supposed.\n If the plaintiff can recover, it must be upon an implied contract. For, under the Tucker Act, the consent of the United States to be sued is ( so far as here material) limited to claims founded 'upon any contract, express or implied'; and a remedy for claims sounding in tort is expressly denied. Bigby v. United States, \n188 U.S. 400\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 468; Hijo v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 315, 323\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 727. As stated in United States v. Lynah, \n188 \nU.S. 445, 462\n, 465 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 349, 354 (47 L. Ed. 539):\n'The law will imply a promise to make the required compensation, where property to which the government asserts no title, \n\n[248 U.S. 121, 130]\n\u00a0\n is taken, pursuant to an act of Congress, as private property to be applied for public uses.'\n\n Or in other words:\n'Whenever in the exercise of its governmental rights it takes property, the ownership of which it concedes to be in an individual, it impliedly promises to pay therefor.'\n\n But in the case at bar, both the pleadings and the facts found preclude the implication of a promise to pay. For the property applied to the public use is not and was not conceded to be in the plaintiff.\n Second. The answer, specifically denying that the United States has taken plaintiff's land, excavated a channel through it, and claims possession thereof under the resolution of the Illinois Assembly or otherwise, wise, asserts that in 1909 it did 'excavate a channel in the Chicago river in the center of the stream and now claims possession thereof for the purpose of making more navigable the North branch.' The findings of fact made by the trial court (amplified by the reports of the Secretary of War, of which we take judicial notice) show that the government claimed at the time of the alleged taking and now claims that it already possessed, when it made its excavation in 1909, the property right actually in question. It is unnecessary to determine whether this claim of the government is well founded. The mere fact that the government then claimed and now claims title in itself and that it denies title in the plaintiff, prevents the court from assuming jurisdiction of the controversy. The law cannot imply a promise by the government to pay for a right over, or interest in, land, which right or interest the government claimed and claims it possessed before it utilized the same. If the government's claim is unfounded, a property right of plaintiff was violated; but the cause of action therefor, it any, is one sounding in tort; and for such, the Tucker Act affords no remedy. Hill v. United States, \n149 U.S. 593\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 1011, which both in its pleadings and its facts bears a strong resemblance \n\n[248 U.S. 121, 131]\n\u00a0\n to the case at bar, is conclusive on this point. See, also, Schillinger v. United States, \n155 U.S. 163\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 85. The case at bar is entirely unlike both the Lynah Case and the Cress Case. In neither of those cases does it appear that, at the time of taking, there was any claim by the government of a right to invade the property in question without the payment of compensation. Under such circumstances it must be assumed that the government intended to take and to make compensation for any property taken, so as to afford the basis for an implied promise. And when the implied promise to pay has once arisen, a later denial by the government (whether at the time of suit or otherwise) of its liability to make compensation does not destroy the right in contract and covert the act into a tort. In both of those cases the facts required the implication of a promise to pay. But here the government has contended since the beginning of the improvement that, at the time of the dredging in 1899 and in 1909, it possessed the right of navigation over the land in question; which right of navigation, if it existed, gave it the right to dredge further in order to improve navigation. The facts preclude implying a promise to pay. If the government is wrong in its contention, it has committed a tort. The United States has not conferred upon the District Court jurisdiction to determine such a controversy. See Cramp & Sons v. Curtis Turbine Co., \n246 \nU.S. 28, 40\n, 41 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 271.\n The District Court, instead of rendering judgment for the United States, should have dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction.\n Judgment reversed and case remanded to the District Court, with directions to dismiss it for want of jurisdiction.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The character of the river and rights incidental thereto have been frequently considered by this court.

This bill of sale reads as follows:\n'72 Bales; Aggregate Weight 37309 at 15 $5,596.35\/100\n\n'State of Mississippi, County of Copiah:\n\n'Pine Ridge, April 28\/63.\n\n'The undersigned having sold to the Confederate States of America, and received the value of same in bonds, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, bales of cotton, marked, numbered and classed as in the margin, which are now deposited at his gin house & shed hereby agrees to take due care of said cotton whilst on his plantation, and to deliver the same at his own expense, at Brookhaven, in the state of Miss. to the order of the Secretary of the Treasury, or his agents, or their assigns.\n\n'J. H. Thompson.'\n\n It is further alleged that the appellant has no knowledge as to the disposition made of the bonds received by his decedent and that they became valueless on surrender of the military forces of the Confederate States; that the cotton remained in the possession of his decedent until subsequent to June 30, 1865, when forty-three of the seventy-two bales were taken from him by United States Treasury agents under warrant of the Act of Congress, approved March 3, 1863, entitled 'An act to provide for the collection of abandoned property' and for other purposes; that the cotton was sold and the pro- \n\n[246 U.S. 547, 549]\n\u00a0\n ceeds deposited in the Treasury of the United States, and that 'the claimant (appellant) and said decedent have at all times borne true allegiance to the government of the United States and have not in any way voluntarily aided, abetted or given encouragement to rebellion against the said government, that is to say, if any such acts were committed during the late Civil War between the years 1861 and 1865, a full pardon has been granted therefor by the President of the United States.'\n Upon the facts thus stated the appellant asserts a right to recover the net proceeds of the cotton seized and sold, based upon the terms of section 162 of the Act of March 3, 1911 (the Judicial Code) which reads as follows:\n'Sec. 162. The Court of Claims shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the claims of those whose property was taken subsequent to June the first, 1865, under the provisions of the act of Congress approved March twelfth [third], 1863, entitled 'An act to provide for the collection of abandoned property and for the prevention of frauds in insurrectionary districts within the United States,' and acts amendatory thereof where the property so taken was sold and the net proceeds thereof were placed in the Treasury of the United States; and the Secretary of the Treasury shall return said net proceeds to the owners thereof, on the judgment of said court, and full jurisdiction is given to said court to adjudge said claims, any statutes of limitations to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n\n Assuming that the pardon pleaded in the petition and the decisions of this court relieve the appellant of any disability on account of the claimed disloyalty of his decedent (Carlisle v. United States, 16 Wall. 147), it is clear that he can prevail only if his decedent was the owner of t e cotton when it was seized, for the Court of Claims is given jurisdiction to hear and determine only 'claims of \n\n[246 U.S. 547, 550]\n\u00a0\n those whose property is taken,' and this language can have no other meaning.\n In the case of Whitfield v. United States, \n92 U.S. 165\n, it was decided that a sale of cotton, with payment in bonds, under circumstances precisely similar to those we have here, passed title to the Confederate government without formal delivery, so that the vendor ceased to be the owner of the cotton from the time he accepted the bonds.\n It is frankly conceded by the appellant that this decision rules the case at bar and we are asked to reconsider and overrule it on various grounds.\n It is argued that, because appellant's decedent in this case (as in that) continued in possession of the cotton until his vendee became insolvent and the bonds given in payment became valueless, he had a lien for the value of it, which constituted him the owner within the meaning of the statute.\n The report of the Whitfield Case shows that this claim was pressed upon the attention of this court, and that it was rejected for the reason that the bonds were accepted as payment, as fully as if it had been made in money, with all the incidents of such payment. With this conclusion we are satisfied.\n It is also argued that Congress, in enacting this section, intended to give a right of recovery to all persons who sold cotton to the Confederate government, which was afterwards seized by the United States under warrant of the Act of March 3, 1863, referred to, and upon the theory that such sales were void and therefore did not pass title but left the nominal vendors the owners of the cotton, we are urged to so construe the section as to give effect to such supposed intention.\n It is asserted that evidence of this intention is to be found in the fact that if not so construed the section will be ineffective and meaningless, because all claims for \n\n[246 U.S. 547, 551]\n\u00a0\n property taken from owners under the Act of March 3, 1863, other than for such as was sold to the Confederate government had been disposed of before its enactment.\n Even if the non-existence of other claims for the statute to operate upon were shown, as it is not, by the petition and the attached exhibit, still this contention could not be allowed.\n The intention of the Congress is to be sought for primarily in the language used, and where this expresses an intention reasonably intelligible and plain it must be accepted without modification by resort to construction or conjecture. Gardner v. Collins, 2 Pet. 58, 93; United States v. Goldenberg, \n168 \nU.S. 95, 102\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 3.\n We have found that section 162, relied upon by appellant, is sufficiently clear in meaning, and we cannot doubt that if the Congress had intended by it to change the law, as evidenced by the Whitfield decision, of which we must assume that it had full knowledge (Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. C. v. Manning, \n186 \nU.S. 238, 245\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 881) it would have done so in plain terms, especially in a matter of such great importance as we have here, and that language would not have been used which, as we have seen, confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims only in cases which are clearly consonant with and within the scope of that decision.\n It results that the judgment of the Court of Claims must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTOLEDO NEWSPAPER CO. v.

But this does not relieve us from the duty of exerting jurisdiction, as we are of opinion that the case calls for the exertion of the discretionary power with which we are vested. The writ of certiorari is therefore granted and we proceed to examine and dispose of the case to the extent rendered necessary by that conclusion.\n The case is this: The Toledo Railways & Light Company in 1913 controlled and operated practically all the street railways in Toledo. The franchises under which it did so, however, it was generally considered, expired on the 27th of March, 1914. In anticipation of this fact negotiations as to the terms upon which they should be renewed were broached between the city and the company and pronounced differences were manifested. This gave rise to public agitation and discussion over the question which had become acute in November, 1913. In that month, evidently in order to enable the city to secure from the company such terms of agreement as it might impose, an ordinance was passed without giving any new franchise or in terms making any new contract with the company, providing that on and after the 27th of March, 1914, the assumed day of the expiration of the franchises, three-cent fares should be charged from day to day. Complaint alleging the injustice of this provision and the wrong which the railroad asserted would be produced by giving it effect increased the agitation.\n In January, 1914, creditors of the company filed in the District Court of the United States their bill against the company to enjoin it from obeying the ordinance on the ground that to do so would confiscate the property which they held in the company and would destroy the franchises which the company enjoyed and which, it was asserted, only expired in the following October. On March 24th \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 412]\n\u00a0\n the creditors filed a supplemental bill making the city a party to the suit and asking preliminary and permanent injunctions against the city. On the same day the company also filed its bill against the city seeking to restrain the enforcement of the ordinance both by preliminary and final injunctions.\n At this juncture and before action had been taken by the court, the Toledo News-Bee, a daily paper published in Toledo by the Toledo Newspaper Company, began publications adverse to the rights asserted against the city by the creditors and the railway company and in no uncertain terms avouched the right of the city to have enacted the ordinance which the suits assailed and challenged the right of the court to grant the relief prayed. On March 30th the court after hearing on the applications for preliminary injunctions denied them on the ground that the assailed ordinance was not self-enforcing, that it required an application for judicial power to put it into effect and that it would be time enough when the city invoked such relief by such power to assert by way of defense the matters which were made the basis of the prayer for affirmative relief in the pending controversies.\n In September following under a new prayer the court reconsidered its action and awarded the preliminary injunction prayed on the ground that as the city had in the meanwhile treated the ordinance as enforceable without resort to judicial process and was acting against the company and the creditors and their alleged rights on that assumption, the duty was cast upon the court of protecting such rights pending the decision of the causes. In the meanwhile, however, the agitation over the questions which the suits involved had unremittingly continued and was beyond doubt fanned by continuous publications on the subject in the stated newspaper into a more exaggerated-not to use a stronger word-and \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 413]\n\u00a0\n vociferous expression which embraced the whole field; that is, not only the relative rights of the city and the corporation, but also at least by indirection the duty and power of the court and its right to afford any relief in the matters before it.\n Immediately preceding the action of the court taken on September 12th granting the preliminary injunction and while that subject was before it for consideration, an attachment for contempt was issued against one Quinlivan for words spoken by him at a meeting of a labor union concerning the court and the matter which it was then engaged in considering. And a few days following, on September 15th, a similar process was issued against the managing editor of the Toledo News-Bee for publications written by him in the paper concerning the action of the court in the Quinlivan case.\n On September 29th following the court directed the district attorney to present an information for contempt against the newspaper company and its editor for the publications which had been made concerning the controversy and on October 28th, giving effect to this order, an information was filed charging the newspaper company and the editor with contempt. The charges were stated in three counts. The first embraced matters published during the pendency of the suit from the time, March 24th, when the action was taken to make the city a party and the respective preliminary injunctions were prayed, up to and including the time when the ultimate action of the court on the subject in September was taken. The two other counts related, the one to publications made at the time of and concerning the attachment for contempt against Quinlivan, and the other to publications concerning the attachment against the managing editor. The defendants demurred on the ground that the information stated no act within the power of the court to \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 414]\n\u00a0\n punish for contempt and on the overruling of the demurrer they answered, not disputing the publications charged, but challenging the innuendoes by which in the information they were interpreted and reiterating the denial of all power in the court to punish.\n Coming to dispose of the information the court found both of the defendants guilty under all t e counts and imposed upon both a punishment by way of fine. The court sustained its authority to so act by an elaborate opinion, which after stating the evidentiary facts-the publications and their environment-drew from them ultimate conclusions of fact and held that from such conclusions it clearly resulted that the publications complained of constituted a contempt within the power of the court to punish because by their terms they manifestly tended to interfere with and obstruct the court in the discharge of its duty in a matter pending before it. Condensing for the sake of brevity and looking at the substance of things, these conclusions of the court embraced four grounds: ( a) Because, leaving aside the attempted ridicule, not to say vituperation, concerning the court which was expressly or impliedly contained in the publications, their manifest purpose was to create the impression on the mind of the court that it could not decide in the matter before it in any but the one way without giving rise to such a state of suspicion as to the integrity or fairness of its purpose and motives as might engender a shrinking from so doing. (b) Because the publications directly tended to incite to such a condition of the public mind as would leave no room for doubt that if the court acting according to its convictions awarded relief, it would be subject to such odium and hatred as to restrain it from doing so. (c) Because the publications also obviously were intended to produce the impression that any order which might be rendered by the court in the discharge of its duty if not in accord with the con- \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 415]\n\u00a0\n ceptions which the publications were sustaining, would be disregarded and cause a shrinking from performing duty to avoid the turmoil an violence which the publications, it may be only by covert insinuation, but none the less assuredly invited. And (d) because the publications were of a character, not merely because of their intemperance but because of their general tendency, to produce in the popular mind a condition which would give rise to a purpose in practice to refuse to respect any order which the court might render if it conflicted with the supposed rights of the city espoused by the publications. 220 Fed. 458.\n The affirmance by the court below of the action of the trial court thus stated, is the matter now before us for review. That court, not asserting the right or attempting to exert the power to review the merely evidentiary facts found by the trial court, but accepting them, in express terms sanctioned the inferences of ultimate fact drawn from them by the trial court. The court said:\n'The publications had reference to pending judicial action, and there is a finding of fact ('as alleged in the information') that they tended and were intended to provoke public resistance to an injunctional order, if one should be made, and there is a finding that they constituted an attempt to intimidate-at least unduly to influence-the District Judge with reference to his decision in the matter pending before him. That each of these findings is supported by competent evidence and for that reason binding upon this court is too clear for dispute; but we may rightly go further and say that it is difficult to see how any other findings could have been made.'\n\n This view, however, was restricted to the matters embraced by the first count since it was decided that it was irrelevant to consider whether the same view would obtain as to the subject-matters of the second and third counts because it was held that in any event the finding of guilt under the first \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 416]\n\u00a0\n count was adequate to justify the penalty imposed, thus rendering a consideration of the other two counts unnecessary. 237 Fed. 986, 150 C. C. A. 636.\n Under the case and the action of the courts below concerning it, nothing further would seem to be required to establish the correctness of that action since no other course under the statement is possible compatibly with the sacred obligation of courts to preserve heir right to discharge their duties free from unlawful and unworthy influences and in doing so, if needs be, to clear from the pathway leading to the performance of this great duty all unwarranted attempts to pervert, obstruct or distort judgment. Nevertheless in view of the gravity of the subject we proceed to consider and dispose of the elaborate arguments pressed to the contrary. They are all embraced by the three following propositions: First, that there was a total want of power in the court to treat the matters charged in the information as a contempt and punish it accordingly as a result of the provisions of section 268 of the Judicial Code (embodying the text of the Act of March 2, 1831, c. 99, 4 Stat. 487); second, that irrespective of the prohibitions of that act there was a want of power to abridge the freedom of the press by punishing as for a summary contempt comments made by a newspaper upon matters of public concern; and third, that whatever be the view of the two former propositions as there was an entire absence of proof sustaining the ultimate inferences of fact upon which the court based its conclusion, such conclusion was wholly erroneous as a matter of law. We dispose of these propositions under separate headings.\n\n 1. \nSection 268 of the Judicial Code and its forerunner, the Act of 1831\n\n\n It is essential to recall the situation existing at the time of the adoption of the Act of 1831 in order to elucidate its provisions. In Marshall v. Gordon, \n243 U.S. 521\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 448, L. R. A. 1917F, 279, the power of Congress to summarily punish for contempt \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 417]\n\u00a0\n came under consideration and it was there pointed out that the enlarged legislative power on that subject which prevailed in England prior to the separation, whether based upon the commingling of legislative and judicial authority or upon any other cause, was necessarily in this country greatly restricted and changed by the effect of the adoption of the Constitution and the operation of the division of powers and the guaranties and limitations which that instrument embodied. Considering this condition in the light of the colonial legislation on the subject and the previous state constitutions, it was pointed out that it had come to be established, either by express constitutional or legislative provisions or by inevitable implications resting upon the very existence of government, that while the limitations as to mode of accusation of crime and methods of trial had fundamentally changed the situation which had previously existed, such change had not deprived the legislative power of the right, irrespective of its authority by legislation to provide for the trial and punishment of criminal acts, in addition to summarily deal by way of contempt proceedings with wrongful acts obstructing the legislative power in the performance of its duty. This authority, it was held, was but an incident of the powers conferred and indeed that its exertion in ultimate analysis was a means of securing the effective operation of the constitutional limitations as to mode of accusation and methods of trial. It was pointed out that the authority thus recognized automatically inhered in the government created by the Constitution, was sanctioned by a long line of judicial decisions and by state and federal practice, although the legislative power, doubtless as a mere consequence of a reminiscence of what had gone before and momentarily forgetful of the limitations resulting from the Constitution, had sometimes exerted authority in excess of that which it was decided was really possessed. \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 418]\n\u00a0\n While the Marshall Case concerned the exercise of legislative power to deal with contempt, the fundamental principles which its solution involved are here applicable to the extent that they may not be inapposite because of the distinction between legislative and judicial power. Indeed the identity of the constitutional principles applicable to the two cases subject to the differences referred to was pointed out (243 U. S. on pages 542 and 543, 37 Sup. Ct. on page 454, L. R. A. 1917F, 279), where it was said:\n'So also when the difference between the judicial and legislative powers are considered and the divergent elements which in the nature of things enter into the determination of what is self-preservation in the two cases, the same result is established by the statutory provisions dealing with the judicial authority to summarily punish for contempt, that is, without resorting to the modes of trial required by constitutional limitations or otherwise for substantive offenses under the criminal law. Act of March 2, 1831, 4 Stat. 487.'\n\n The pertinent provision of section 268 of the Judicial Code is as follows:\n'The said courts [United States courts] shall have power ... to punish, by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of the court, contempts of their authority: Provided, that such power to punish for contempts shall not be construed to extend to any cases except the misbehavior of any person in their presence, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice. ...'\n\n Clarified by the matters expounded and the ruling made in the Marshall Case, there can be no doubt that the provision conferred no power not already granted and imposed no limitations not already existing. In other words, it served but to plainly mark the boundaries of the existing authority resulting from and controlled by the grants which the Constitution made and the limitations which it imposed. And this is not at all modified \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 419]\n\u00a0\n by conceding that the provision was intended to prevent the danger by reminiscence of what had gone before of attempts to exercise a power not possessed which, as pointed out in the Marshall Case, had been sometimes done in the exercise of legislative power. The provision therefore, conformably to the whole history of the country, not minimizing the constitutional limitations nor restricting or qualifying the powers granted, by necessary implication recognized and sanctioned the existence of the right of self-preservation, that is, the power to restrain acts tending to obstruct and prevent the untrammeled and unprejudiced exercise of the judicial power given by summarily treating such acts as a contempt and punishing accordingly. The test therefore is the character of the act done and its direct tendency to prevent and obstruct the discharge of judicial duty-a conclusion which necessarily sustains the view of the statute taken by the courts below and brings us to the second question, which is:\n\n 2. \nThe asserted inapplicability of the statute under the assumption that the publications complained of related to a matter of public concern and were safeguarded from being made the basis of contempt proceedings by the assuredly secured freedom of the press.\n We might well pass the proposition by because to state it is to answer it, since it involves in its very statement the contention that the freedom of the press is the freedom to do wrong with impunity and implies the right to frustrate and defeat the discharge of those governmental duties upon the performance of which the freedom of all, including that of the press, depends. The safeguarding and fructification of free and constitutional institutions is the very basis and mainstay upon which the freedom of the press rests and that freedom therefore does not and cannot be held to include the right virtually to destroy such institutions. It suffices to say that however com- \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 420]\n\u00a0\n plete is the right of the press to state public things and discuss them, that right as every other right enjoyed in human society is subject to the restraints which separate right from wrongdoing.\n The contention so earnestly pressed that the express provision found in a statute enacted in Pennsylvania in 1809 following the impeachment proceedings against Judge Peck dealing with the extent of the power to base a contempt proceeding upon a newspaper publication should be by implication read into the Act of 1831 and by filtration implied in section 268, Judicial Code, we think is answered by its mere statement since if it be conceded for argument's sake only that the provision in the Pennsylvania statute relied upon had the significance now attributed to it and that the Pennsylvania statute was the model of the Act of 1831, the omission from that act of the provision referred to as it existed in the Pennsylvania law is the strongest possible evidence of the purpose not to enact such provision. And thus we come to the third and final subject, which is:\n\n 3. \nThe contention that there was no evidence whatever to justify attributing to the publications the consequence of obstruction and therefore no legal basis for the conclusion of guilt and resulting right to impose penalties.\n It is to be observed that our power in disposing of this objection is not to test divergent contentions as to the weight of the evidence but simply to consider the legal question whether the evidentiary facts found had any reasonable tendency to sustain the general conclusions of fact based upon them by the courts below. Considering the subject in this aspect again we are constrained to say that the contention on the face of the record is too plainly devoid of merit to require any detailed review. Indeed we are of opinion that the court below was right in saying concerning the ultimate conclusions of fact upon which its action was based that it was 'difficult \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 421]\n\u00a0\n to see how any other findings could have been made.' True, it is urged that although the matters which were made the basis of the findings were published at the place where the proceedings were pending and under the circumstances which we have stated in a daily paper having a large circulation, as it was not shown that they had been seen by the presiding judge or had been circulated in the courtroom, they did not could form no basis for an inference of guilt. But the situation is controlled by the reasonable tendencies of the acts done and not by extreme and substantially impossible assumptions on the subject. Again it is said there is no proof that the mind of the judge was influenced or his purpose to do his duty obstructed or restrained by the publications and therefore there was no proof tending to show the wrong complained of. But here again not the influence upon the mind of the particular judge is the criterion but the reasonable tendency of the acts done to influence or bring about the baleful result is the test. In other words, having regard to the powers conferred, to the protection of society, to the honest and fair administration of justice and to the evil to come from its obstruction, the wrong depends upon the tendency of the acts to accomplish this result without reference to the consideration of how far they may have been without influence in a particular case. The wrongdoer may not be heard to try the power of the judge to resist acts of obstruction and wrongdoing by him committed as a prelude to trial and punishment for his wrongful acts.\n This disposes of the case for although the court below we think mistakenly considered that it was not under the duty to determine how far the facts sustained the charges under counts 2 and 3 because the conviction might be referred wholly to the first count (Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 440\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 492, 34 L. R. A. [N. S.] 874), we are of opinion after examining the facts as to both of \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 422]\n\u00a0\n those counts that they also sustain the conviction within the principles which we have just previously stated.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the decision of this cause.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n One of the usual controversies between a street railroad and the city that it served had been going on for years and had culminated in an ordinance establishing three cent fares that was to go into effect on March 28, 1914. In January of that year the people who were operating the road began a suit for an injun tion on the ground that the ordinance was confiscatory. The plaintiffs in error, a newspaper and its editor, had long been on the popular side and had furnished news and comment to sustain it; and when, on March 2, a motion was made for a temporary injunction in the suit, they published a cartoon representing the road as a moribund man in bed with his friends at the bedside and one of them saying 'Guess we'd better call in Doc Killits.' Thereafter pending the controversy they published news, comment and cartoons as before. The injunction was issued on September 12. The Judge (Killits) who was referred to took no steps until September 29, when he directed an information to be filed covering publications from March 24 through September 17. This was done on October 28. In December the case was tried summarily without a jury by the judge who thought his authority contemned, and in the following year he imposed a considerable fine. The question is whether he acted within his powers under the statutes of the United States.\n The statute in force at the time of the alleged contempts confined the power of courts in cases of this sort to where \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 423]\n\u00a0\n there had been 'misbehavior of any person in their presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice.' Section 268, Jud. Code, Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1163. Before the trial took place an act was passed giving a trial by jury upon demand of the accused in all but the above-mentioned instances. October 15, 1914, c. 323,  22, 24, 38 Stat. 738, 739 (Comp. St. 1916,  1245b, 1245d). In England, I believe, the usual course is to proceed in the regular way by indictment. I mention this fact and the later statute only for their bearing upon the meaning of the exception in our law. When it is considered how contrary it is to our practice and ways of thinking for the same person to be accuser and sole judge in a matter which if he be sensitive, may involve strong personal feeling, I should expect the power to be limited by the necessities of the case 'to insure order and decorum in their presence' as it is stated in Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505. See Prynne, Plea for the Lords, 309, cited in McIlwain, The High Court of Parliament and its Supremacy, 191. And when the words of the statute are read it seems to me that the limit is too plain to be construed away. To my mind they point only to the present protection of the Court from actual interference, and not to postponed retribution for lack of respect for its dignity-not to moving to vindicate its independence after enduring the newspaper's attacks for nearly six months as the Court did in this case. Without invoking the rule of strict construction I think that 'so near as to obstruct' means so near as actually to obstruct-and not merely near enough to threaten a possible obstruction. 'So near as to' refers to an accomplished fact, and the word 'misbehavior' strengthens the construction I adopt. Misbehavior means something more than adverse comment or disrespect.\n But suppose that an imminent possibility of obstruction is sufficient. Still I think that only immediate and necessary action is contemplated, and that no case for sum- \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 424]\n\u00a0\n mary proceedings is made out if after the event publications are called to the attention of the judge that might have led to an obstruction although they did not. So far as appears that is the present case. But I will go a step farther. The order for the information recites that from time to time sundry numbers of the paper have come to the attention of the judge as a daily reader of it, and I will assume, from that and the opinion, that he read them as they came out, and I will assume further that he was entitled to rely upon his private knowledge without a statement in open court. But a judge of the United States is expected to be a man of ordinary firmness of character, and I find it impossible to believe that such a judge could have found in anything that was printed even a tendency to prevent his performing his sw rn duty. I am not considering whether there was a technical contempt at common law but whether what was done falls within the words of an act intended and admitted to limit the power of the courts.\n The chief thing done was to print statements of a widespread public intent to board the cars and refuse to pay more than three cents even if the judge condemned the ordinance, statements favoring the course, if you like, and mention of the city officials who intended to back it up. This popular movement was met on the part of the railroad by directing its conductors not to accept three cent fares but to carry passengers free who refused to pay more; so that all danger of violence on that score was avoided, even if it was a danger that in any way concerned the Court. The newspaper further gave one or two premature but ultimately correct intimations of what the judge was going to do, made one mistaken statement of a ruling which it criticized indirectly, uttered a few expressions that implied that the judge did not have the last word and that no doubt contained innuendoes not flattering to his personality. Later there was an account \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 425]\n\u00a0\n of a local socialist meeting at which a member, one Quinlivan, spoke in such a way that the judge attached him for contempt and thereupon, on the same day that the decree was entered in the principal case, the paper reported as the grounds of the attachment that Quinlivan had pronounced Judge Killits to have shown from the first that he was favorable to the railroad, had criticized somewhat ignorantly a ruling said to put the burden of proof on the city, and had said that Killits and his press were unfair to the people, winding up 'impeach Killits.' I confess that I cannot find in all this or in the evidence in the case anything that would have affected a mind of reasonable fortitude, and still less can I find there anything that obstructed the administration of justice in any sense that I possibly can give to those words.\n In the elaborate opinion that was delivered by Judge Killits to justify the judgment it is said:\n'In this matter the record shows that the Court endured the News- Bee's attacks upon suitors before it and upon the Court itself, and carried all the embarrassment inevitable from these publications, for nearly six months before moving to vindicate its independence.'\n\n It appears to me that this statement is enough to show that there was no emergency, that there was nothing that warranted a finding that the administration of justice was obstructed, or a resort to this summary proceeding, but that on the contrary when the matter was over, the Judge thought that the 'consistently unfriendly attitude against the Court,' and the fact that the publications tended 'to arouse distrust and dislike of the Court' were sufficient to justify this information and a heavy fine. They may have been, but not, I think, in this form of trial. I would go as far as any man in favor of the sharpest and most summary enforcement of order in court and obedience to decrees, but when there is no need for immediate action contempts are like any other breach of law and should be dealt with as the law \n\n[247 U.S. 402, 426]\n\u00a0\n deals with other illegal acts. Action like the present in my opinion is wholly unwarranted by even color of law.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","163":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTOWNE v. EISNER(1918)\nNo. 563\nArgued: December 12, 1917Decided: January 7, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 418, 419]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, George Welwood Murray, Charles P. Howland, and Louis H. Porter, all of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[245 U.S. 418, 421]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n\n[245 U.S. 418, 424]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover the amount of a tax paid under duress in respect of a stock dividend alleged by the Government to be income. A demurrer to the declaration was sustained by the District Court and judgment was entered for the defendant. 242 Fed. 702. The facts alleged are that the corporation voted on December 17, 1913, to transfer $1,500, 000 surplus, being profits earned before January 1, 1913, to its capital account and to issue fifteen thousand shares of stock representing the same to its stockholders of record on December 26; that the distribution took place on January 2, 1914, and that the plaintiff received as his due proportion four thousand one hundred and seventy-four and a half shares. The defendant compelled the plaintiff to pay an income tax upon this stock as equivalent to $417,450 income in cash. The District Court held that the stock was income \n\n[245 U.S. 418, 425]\n\u00a0\n within the meaning of the Income Tax of October 3, 1913, c. 16, Section II; A, subdivisions 1 and 2; and B. 38 Stat. 114, 116, 167. It also held that the Act so construed was constitutional, whereas the declaration set up that so far as the Act purported to confer power to make this levy it was unconstitutional and void.\n The Government in the first place moves to dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the only question here is the construction of the statute not its constitutionality. It argues that if such a stock dividend is not income within the meaning of the Constitution it is not income within the intent of the statute, and hence that the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment is not an immediate issue, and is important only as throwing light on the construction of the Act. But it is not necessarily true that income means the same thing in the Constitution and the Act. A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used. Lamar v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 60, 65\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 255. Whatever the meaning of the Constitution, the Government had applied its force to the plaintiff, on the assertion that the statute authorized it to do so, before the suit was brought, and the Court below has sanctioned its course. The plaintiff says that the statute as it is construed and administered is unconstitutional. He is not to be defeated by the reply that the Government does not adhere to the construction by virtue of which alone it has taken and keeps the plaintiff's money, if this Court should think that the construction would make the Act unconstitutional. While it keeps the money it opens the question whether the Act construed as it has construed it can be maintained. The motion to dismiss is overruled. Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261, 276\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 421; B. Altman & Co. v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 583, 596\n, 597 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 593. \n\n[245 U.S. 418, 426]\n\u00a0\n The case being properly here, however, the construction of the act is open, as well as its constitutionality if construed as the Government has construed it by its conduct. Billings v. United States, ubi supra. Notwithstanding the thoughtful discussion that the case received below we cannot doubt that the dividend was capital as well for the purposes of the Income Tax Law as for distribution between tenant for life and remainderman. What was said by this Court upon the latter question is equally true for the former. 'A stock dividend really takes nothing from the property of the corporation, and adds nothing to the interests of the shareholders. Its property is not diminished, and their interests are not increased. ... The proportional interests of each shareholder remains the same. The only change is in the evidence which represents that interest, the new shares and the original shares together representing the same proportional interest that the original shares represented before the issue of new ones.' Gibbons v. Mahon, \n136 \nU.S. 549, 559\n, 560 S., 10 Sup. Ct. 1057. In short, the corporation is no poorer and the stockholder is no richer than they were before. Logan County v. United States, \n169 \nU.S. 255, 261\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 361. If the plaintiff gained any small advantage by the change, it certainly was not an advantage of $417,450, the sum upon which he was taxed. It is alleged and admitted that he receives no more in the way of dividends and that his old and new certificates together are worth only what the old ones were worth before. If the sum had been carried from surplus to capital account without a corresponding issue of stock certificates, which there was nothing in the nature of things to prevent, we do not suppose that any one would contend that the plaintiff had received an accession to his income. Presumably his certificate would have the same value as before. Again, if certificates for $1,000 par were split up into ten certificates each, for $ 100, we presume that no \n\n[245 U.S. 418, 427]\n\u00a0\n one would call the new certificates income. What has happened is that the plaintiff's old certificates have been split up in effect and have diminished in value to the extent of the value of the new.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S EX REL LOUISVILLE CEMENT CO. v. INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION(1918)\nNo. 70\nArgued: March 14, 1918Decided: April 29, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. J. Van Dyke Norman, of Louisville, Ky., and Frank Lyon and George H. Lamar, both of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Charles W. Needham, of Washington, D. C., and Joseph W. Folk, of St. Louis, Mo., for defendant in error. \n\n[246 U.S. 638, 639]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The facts of this case are not disputed and are as follows:\n By mistake in printing its tariff, the published rate of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company on coal from mines in Kentucky to Speeds, Ind., was increased on July 29, 1906, to $1.10 per ton from $1, which had been the rate before.\n The mistake was not noticed and the old rate was charged and paid by relator (plaintiff in error) on shipments until the following February, when, the increased published rate being discovered, it was charged and collected until the next April, when the former rate was restored.\n Promptly on April 19, 1907, the relator wrote the Interstate Commerce Commission, explaining the circumstances, and requesting that the railroad company be authorized to refund the overcharges paid, February 11 to April 10, 1907, amounting to $595.65.\n The Commission replied to this letter, that if the railroad company would file with the Commission an admission that the rate had been increased through error and would ask for authority to make the refund, the subject would receive consideration.\n This statement of the Commission was immediately communicated to the railroad company, but it refused to make the required admission of mistake and to request authority to make the refund until the full published rate was paid on shipments made before the mistake was discovered. This led to dispute and delay, with the result that these excess charges ($1,335.25) were not paid until February 1, 1911\n\n\n In the following November the relator filed its petition with the Commission asking for an order permitting the railroad company to refund the entire amount, in excess of the former rate, paid under the mistakenly published tariff. \n\n[246 U.S. 638, 640]\n\u00a0\n The railroad company admitted that it never in ended to increase the rate and consented that the reparation order prayed for should be issued.\n The Commission found, as a matter of fact, that the mistakenly published rate of $1.10 was unreasonable to the extent that it exceeded $1 per ton, and then, holding that all complaints for the recovery of damages must be filed with the Commission within two years from the date of the delivery of the shipment, it ruled that the letter of the relator to the Commission of April 19, 1907, making claim for the overcharges which had been paid between February 11 and April 10, 1907, was sufficient to satisfy the law, and ultimately issued to the railroad company authority to pay this amount to the relator; but the Commission further held that the complaint for the recovery of the overcharges for the period prior to February 11th, although filed within nine months of the date of their payment, was not in time to meet the requirement of section 16 of the act that 'all complaints for the recovery of damages shall be filed with the Commission within two years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after,' and that 'they (the overcharges) are, therefore, barred from our consideration.'\n The relator filed its petition for a writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, which petition was denied, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District affirming this holding is here for review.\n The lower courts arrived at their conclusion by holding that the Commission entertained jurisdiction over the portion of the relator's claim which was rejected; that in the exercise of that jurisdiction it held the claim to be barred and that this was an exercise of discretion committed by law to the Commission which is not subject to control by the writ of mandamus.\n We think the courts fell into error in thus interpreting the language used by the Commission in its report. \n\n[246 U.S. 638, 641]\n\u00a0\n As to the portion of the claim which we are considering, the report of the Commission is as follows:\n'The only question left for determination is whether the claim is barred, in whole or in part, by the following limitation of the act: 'All complaints for the recovery of damages shall be filed with the Commission within two years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after.'\n\n'The Commission holds that the date when the cause of action accrues is the date of the delivery of the shipment. Blinn Lumber Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., 18 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 430. ... No complaint was filed by complainant [relator] with reference to shipments made before February 1st, 1907, until the petition here in question was filed on November 15th, 1911, and these shipments had all been delivered more than four years before the filing of that petition. They [the overcharges] are therefore barred from our consideration.'\n\n The concluding sentence thus used by the Commission, that 'They [the overcharges] are therefore barred from our consideration,' implies that in the opinion of the Commission the two-year provision of the sixteenth section of the act is a limitation upon its power, and that the construction which it gave to this limitation placed the claim we are considering so beyond its jurisdiction that it could not consider it, and reference to the case cited as authority for its conclusion, Blinn Lumber Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., 18 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 430, makes it clear that such was the intended holding. In that case the Commission expresses its conclusion in this form:\n'After careful consideration of the contentions of all parties ... as to the right of the complainant' (after two years) 'to maintain this proceeding for reparation before the Commission, it is our conclusion that we are without power to grant the relief prayed for.'\n\n And in Anaconda Copper Mining Co. v. C. & E. \n\n[246 U.S. 638, 642]\n\u00a0\n R. R. Co., 19 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 592, decided seven months later, the Commission makes a yet more emphatic announcement of its views upon the subject, saying:\n'In this report only such shipm nts will be considered as moved within two years from the time the complaint embracing them was filed, and with respect to shipments moving prior to such two-year period we think it proper to state that, following the spirit as well as the letter of the limitation clause contained in section 16 of the act, we believe we are without jurisdiction, and therefore we will not make any finding whatever concerning such shipments or the rates and charges assessed thereon.'\n\n It is thus made very clear that the holding of the Commission was, not that, having jurisdiction over the claim upon consideration thereof, is was found to be barred by a statute of limitation, but that the language of the two-year provision of the act was jurisdictional, and placed it so beyond its power that it could not be considered at all, and that, for this reason, the petition, to the extent it related to the overcharges paid on February 1, 1911, was dismissed.\n We agree with this conclusion of the Commission, that the two-year provision of the act is not a mere statute of limitation, but is jurisdictional-is a limit set to the power of the Commission as distinguished from a rule of law for the guidance of it in reaching its conclusion. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., \n216 \nU.S. 538, 544\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 417. That such was the opinion of this court was clearly intimated in Phillips v. Grand Trunk Western R. R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 662, 667\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 444, and it conforms in principle to the holdings of the court with respect to a similar limitation, but for six years, on the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. Ford v. United States, \n116 U.S. 213\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 360; Finn v. United States, \n123 \nU.S. 227, 232\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 82; United States v. Ward. well, \n172 \nU.S. 48, 52\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 86.\n That the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, \n\n[246 U.S. 638, 643]\n\u00a0\n in a proper case, has power to direct the Commission by mandamus to entertain and proceed to adjudicate a cause which it has erroneously declared to be not within its jurisdiction is decided in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Humboldt Steamship Co., \n224 U.S. 474\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 556. If the Commission did so err, on the authority of many decisions, among them Ex parte Russell, 13 Wall. 664, Ex parte Schollenberger, \n96 U.S. 369\n, Hollon Parker, Petitioner, \n131 U.S. 221\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 708, In re Grossmayer, Petitioner, \n177 U.S. 48\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 535, and Interstate Commerce Commission v. Humboldt Steamship Co., \n224 \nU.S. 474, 485\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 556, the courts may correct such error on a petition for mandamus, where, as in this case, the erroneous decision cannot be reviewed on appeal or writ of error.\n There remains the question, Did the Commission place an erroneous interpretation upon the scope of its jurisdiction under this two-year provision in section 16 of the act, in excluding the claim which we have before us from its consideration?\n This provision first appears in an amendment to the act, approved June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. vol. 1, c. 3591,  5, p. 590), and in January, 1908 the Commission published as its construction of the limitation the following, viz.:\n'A cause of action accrues, as that phrase is used in the act, on the date the freight charges are actually paid.'\n\n The decisions of the Commission show (15 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 201, 235, 533; Marshall & Michel Grain Co. v. St. L. & S. F. R. R. Co., 16 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 385) that it adhered to this construction until May, 1910, when in Blinn Lumber Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., 18 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 430, it changed its ruling and adopted the holding that the cause of action accrues when the shipment was delivered.\n This change, as the report of the Commission shows, resulted, not from any modification of opinion as to the meaning of the language used, but from the conclusion of a majority of its members that such interpreta ion was necessary to give effect to other provisions of the act, especially those relating to rebates and undue preferences. \n\n[246 U.S. 638, 644]\n\u00a0\n But this two-year provision, obviously enough, relates only to the recovery of money damages, and if Congress had intended that the cause of action of the shipper to recover damages for unreasonable charges should accrue when the shipment was received, or when it was delivered by the carrier, we cannot doubt that a simple and obvious form for expressing that intention would have been used, instead of the expression 'from the time the cause of action accrues.' And in this connection we cannot fail to recognize that when the statute was enacted the time when a cause of action accrues had been settled by repeated decisions of this court to be when a suit may first be legally instituted upon it (Amy v. Dubuque, \n98 U.S. 470\n, 474; United States v. Taylor, \n104 U.S. 216\n, 222; Rice v. United States, \n122 \nU.S. 611, 617\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 1377), and, since no clearly controlling language to the contrary is used, it must be assumed that Congress intended that this familiar expression should be given the well-understood meaning which had been given to it by this court. We therefore conclude, as was held, without special discussion of the point, in Phillips v. Grand Trunk Western R. R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 662, 666\n, 668 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 444, which in this respect really rules the case before us, that the proper construction of this jurisdictional provision requires that the cause of action of the shipper in this case shall be held not to have accrued until payment had been made of the unreasonable charges, and that, therefore, the interpretation which the Commission placed upon its jurisdictional power is erroneous.\n The unusual and purely fortuitous circumstance, that the character of this jurisdictional limitation on the power of the Commission chances to be such that the giving of a correct construction to it must result in determining the character of the decision which the Commission must render when the case is returned to it, cannot affect the power of this court or that of the lower \n\n[246 U.S. 638, 645]\n\u00a0\n courts to define what that jurisdiction is under the act of Congress or the duty of the Commission to accept and act upon such definition when announced.\n It results that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed and that the case must be remanded to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, with direction that a writ of mandamus issue to the Commission, directing that it proceed to dispose of the claim in controversy under the construction placed upon its jurisdiction by this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","165":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. BATHGATE(1918)\nNo. 575\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 220, 221]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Fitts, for the United States.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 220, 223]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John R. Holmes and Sherman T. McPherson, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Except as to parties, the indictments in these six cases are alike. Each contains three counts; the first and second undertake to allege a conspiracy to injure and oppress in violation of section 19, Criminal Code ( Act March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1092 [Comp. St. 1916,  10183]), and the third a conspiracy to defraud the United States, contrary to section 37 (Comp. St. 1916,  10201). Demurrers were sustained upon the ground that, rightly construed, neither section applies to the specified acts.\n Section 37, originally part of the Act of March 2, 1867 (14 Stat. 484, c. 169,  30), provides:\n'If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such parties do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each of the parties to such conspiracy shall be fined not more than ten thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than two years, or \n\n[246 U.S. 220, 224]\n\u00a0\n both.'\n\n It was considered in United States v. Gradwell, \n243 U.S. 476\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 407, and held not applicable in circumstances similar to those here presented. The government has accordingly abandoned the third count.\n Section 19 provides:\n'If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same, or if two or more persons go in disguise on the highway, or on the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured, they shall be fined not more than five thousand dollars and imprisoned not more than ten years, and shall, moreover, be thereafter ineligible to any office, or place of honor, profit, or trust created by the Constitution or laws of the United States.'\n\n And the two counts based thereon charge defendants with conspiring to injure candidates for presidential electors, the United States Senate and representative in Congress at the regular election in Ohio, November 7, 1916, also qualified electors who might properly vote thereat, in the free exercise and enjoyment of certain rights and privileges secured by Constitution and laws of the United States, namely-the right (a) of being a candidate; (b) that only those duly qualified should vote; (c) that the results should be determined by voters who had not been bribed; and (d) that the election board should make a true and accurate count of votes legally cast by qualified electors and no others. The indictment further alleged the conspiracy was carried into effect as intended by purchasing votes of certain electors and causing election boards to receive them and make inaccurate returns.\n The real point involved is whether section 19 denounces as criminal a conspiracy to bribe voters at a general election within a state where presidential electors, a United States \n\n[246 U.S. 220, 225]\n\u00a0\n Senator and a representative in Congress are to be chosen. Our concern is not with the power of Congress, but with the proper interpretation of action taken by it. This must be ascertained in view of the settled rule that 'there can be no constructive offenses, and before a man can be punished his case must be plainly and unmistakably within the statute' ( United States v. Lacher, \n134 \nU.S. 624, 628\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 625); and the policy of Congress to leave the conduct of elections at which its members are chosen to state law alone, except where it may have expressed a clear purpose to establish some further or definite regulation.\n Departing from the course long observed, by Act of May 31, 1870, c. 114, 16 Stat. 140, Congress undertook to prescribe a comprehensive system intended to secure freedom and integrity of elections. Section 19 of that act declares:\n'That if at any election for representative or delegate in the Congress of the United States any person shall knowingly ... by force, threat, menace, intimidation, bribery, reward, or offer, or promise thereof, or otherwise unlawfully prevent any qualified voter of any state of the United States of America or of any territory thereof, from freely exercising the right of suffrage, ... or compel or induce by any such means, or otherwise, any officer of an election in any such state or territory to receive a vote from a person not legally qualified or entitled to vote, ... or aid, counsel, procure, or advise any such voter, person, or officer to do any act hereby made a crime, ... every such person shall be deemed guilty of a crime, and shall for such crime be liable to prosecution in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or both, in the discretion of the court, and shall pay the costs of prosecution.'\n\n In pursuance of a well understood policy, the Act of February 8, 1894, c. 25, 28 Stats. \n\n[246 U.S. 220, 226]\n\u00a0\n 36, repealed the foregoing and other kindred sections in Act of 1870 but left in effect section 6, then section 5508, Revised Statutes, and now section 19, Criminal Code (Act March 4, 1909, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1092 [Comp. St. 1916,  10183]). See United States v. Mosley, \n238 U.S. 383\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 904; United States v. Gradwell, supra.\n The government in effect maintains that lawful voters at an election for presidential electors, senator and member of Congress and also the candidates for those places have secured to them by Constitution or laws of the United States the right and privilege that it shall be fairly and honestly conducted; and that Congress intended by section 6, Act of 1870, to punish interference with such right and privilege through conspiracy to influence voters by bribery.\n Section 19, Criminal Code (Comp. St. 1916,  10183), of course, now has the same meaning as when first enacted as section 6, Act of 1870 (see Criminal Code,  339, 341, [Comp. St. 1916,  10513, 10515]); and considering the policy of Congress not to interfere with elections within a state except by clear and specific provisions, together with the rule respecting const uction of criminal statutes, we cannot think it was intended to apply to conspiracies to bribe voters. Bribery, expressly denounced in another section of the original act, is not clearly within the words used; and the reasoning relied on to extend them thereto would apply in respect of almost any act reprehensible in itself, or forbidden by state statutes, and supposed injuriously to affect freedom, honesty, or integrity of an election. This conclusion is strengthened by express repeal of the section applicable in terms to bribery and we think is rendered entirely clear by considering the nature of the rights or privileges fairly within intendment of original section 6.\n The right or privilege to be guarded, as indicated both by the language employed and context, was a definite, personal one, capable of enforcement by a court, and not the political, non-judicable one common to all that the public shall be protected against harmful acts, which is \n\n[246 U.S. 220, 227]\n\u00a0\n here relied on. The right to vote is personal and we have held it is shielded by the section in question. Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 U.S. 651\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 152; United States v. Mosley, supra. The same is true of the right to make homestead entry, United States v. Waddell, \n112 U.S. 76\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 35; also, of the right of one held by a United States marshal to protection against lawless violence, Logan v. United States, \n144 U.S. 263\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 617. While the opinion in United States v. Gradwell, supra, does not determine the precise question now presented, it proceeds upon reasoning which contravenes the theory urged by counsel for the government.\n The court below properly construed the statute and its judgments are\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Biwabik Min Co \n247 U.S. 116\n (1918) ]\n\n\n[247 U.S. 116, 118]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here upon a writ of certiorari to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. It was instituted by the United States in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Ohio to recover the sum of $2,653.72, being 1 per cent. upon $ 265,372.08, which, it was claimed, the mining company had wrongfully omitted from the return of its net income for the year 1910 under the Corporation Tax Act of 1909\n\n\n The case was tried upon an agreed statement of facts which, omitting unnecessary details, were epitomized by the District Court as follows:\n'In the year 1898 the defendant, by assignment of a lease, acquired a leasehold estate in certain ore-producing properties in the state of Minnesota, from which it mined ore from that date to and including the year 1910. For the year 1910 the defendant made a return to the Collector \n\n[247 U.S. 116, 119]\n\u00a0\n of Internal Revenue of its gross income, and from this amount it deducted, 'to cover realization of unearned increment,' the sum of $ 265,372.08. The amount of this deduction was arrived at by multiplying the number of tons of ore mined during the year by 48 3\/4 cents, which was the market value of the ore in place on the premises on the 1st day of January, 1909, as estimated by the defendant, this being the date upon which the returns for taxation were to commence. It is stipulated that this deduction was made in good faith upon the claim that it was 'a reasonable allowance for depreciation' of the property of the defendant for that year.\n\n'In June, 1911, payment was made in accordance with this return, but the Treasury Department about the month of October, 1914, after investigating the books and records of the defendant, made the claim that because the defendant was not the owner in fee of the premises from which it was mining ore, but was lessee of the same and was paying a royalty to the fee owners, it was not entitled to deduct anything for depletion of the ore body on the premises. Thereupon the defendant was requested to amend its return for the year 1910 so as to include in its gross income the amount of said deduction, which it declined to do, and thereupon this suit was instituted to recover the tax upon the amount of this deduction, amounting to $2,653.72.\n\n'Some time prior to the making of the return for the year 1910 the defendant estimated the tonnage and the market value of the ore in place upon the premises upon which it held its lease, which estimate gave to the ore in place a value of 48 3\/4 cents per ton, exclusive of royalty.\n\n'The rights of the defendant in the iron ore mined in the year 1910 were derived from the assignment to it of a written lease dated April 4, 1898, by the Biwabik Bessemer Company, lessor. By the terms of that lease the defendant acquired the right for the term of fifty years \n\n[247 U.S. 116, 120]\n\u00a0\n and three months from the 1st day of May, 1898, to explore for, mine out, and remove the merchantable shipping iron ore which might be found upon the lands described in the lease upon the payment of a royalty of 30 cents for each ton mined. The expression 'merchantable ore' is defined as including 'all ores which grade 55 per cent. and above in metallic iron regardless of other ingredients.'\n\n'The lessee contracted to mine and remove at least 300,000 tons of ore annually, or to pay to the lessor 30 cents per ton on that amount if it should not be mined, but payments made in any year in excess of royalty on ore actually mined could be credited upon the excess which might be mined over the minimum requirement in subsequent years. Any failure to keep or perform any of the covenants or conditions of the lease gave to the lessor the option to take immediate possession of the premises.\n\n'The lessor in the lease reserved a lien upon any ore mined and upon all improvements for any unpaid balance of royalty, and it was also provided in the lease that the lessee should have the right to terminate the lease on any 1st day of January during its term by giving ninety days' notice of the purpose and desire so to do.\n\n'The defendant, at the time it acquired this lease, paid to the prior lessee the sum of $612,000, in addition to contracting to pay the 30 cents per ton royalty upon the ore mined, as has been stated.\n\n'It is stipulated in the agreed statement of facts that the deposit of ore on the leased premises is of such character that its quality and quantity were capable of determination 'with extraordinary accuracy' by drilling and shafts, and that the defendant 'by drilling and by standard recognized methods' had calculated the tonnage remaining on the land on January 1, 1909, as 6,874,695 tons, all of which could be easily removed within the term of the lease.'\n\n Upon these facts the District Court reached the con- \n\n[247 U.S. 116, 121]\n\u00a0\n clusion that the leases in question were not conveyances of ore in place, but were grants of the privilege of entering upon the premises and mining and removing the ore, and, consequently, that the deduction claimed as being one from capital investment could not be allowed. In reaching this conclusion the court cited the opinion of this court in Stratton's Independence, Ltd., v. Howbert, Collector, \n231 U.S. 399\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 136, and the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (211 Fed. 1023, 127 C. C. A. 667), affirming the judgment of the District Court (207 Fed. 419), which decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was made after the return of the answer to the questions propounded by that court to this court in the Stratton's Independence Case.\n Coming to the question as to what allowance should be made to the mining company by way of deduction from its income in making return the District Judge said:\n'The defendant paid $612,000 for the lease under consideration and in addition assumed the payment of the royalties stipulated for therein. This may properly and justly be considered a payment in advance of an increased royalty on ore to be mined, and that is precisely the character which the defendant gave to the payment when dealing with it in its private accounts, in which the stipulation shows (Exhibit H) that it carried one account, entitled 'Rate of General Ledger or Capitalized Value .03885 per Ton,' and another account, entitled 'Rate of Increment Value, January 1, 1909, .44865 per Ton.' These two values added make the 48 3\/4 cents per ton which the defendant deducted in making its return.\n\n'Thus in its own bookkeeping the defendant gives its private opinion as to the requisite reimbursement necessary to maintain its capital investment, and thereby is made applicable that long-standing rule for the construction of contracts, viz. 'Show me what men have done under a contract and I will tell you what it means.' The defendant should not complain if it be held to that \n\n[247 U.S. 116, 122]\n\u00a0\n construction of this lease and its investment under it which it adopted for purposes of its own accounting before the question of taxation had arisen to call forth ingenuity of interpretation.\n\n'It results that a decree will be entered allowing instead of the deduction computed on the basis of 48.75 cents per ton of ore mined, the sum of .03885 cents per ton, and there being no question of bad faith in the case the ends of justice will be served by the payment of interest at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum from the date when the additional payment found due should have been made.'\n\n The District Court thereupon entered judgment:\n'And the court finds as conclusions of law from said facts that the defendant was entitled to deduct for and on account of the 544,353 tons of iron ore mined by it under its lease in the year 1910, the sum of .03885 cents per ton (which amount the parties agree hereby is the cost to defendant of said ore at the time it acquired the property in the year 1898, interest, taxes, surveys, and other carrying charges on the said ore up to the time of its removal from the said mine having been charged annually including the year 1910 into operating expenses), and defendant is not entitled to deduct the 48.75 cents per ton deducted by it in its return, and there is due from the defendant to the plaintiff the sum of $2,442.23, with interest thereon at 6 per cent. from the 30th day of June, 1911, the date when said sum should have been paid, and the court assesses the plaintiff's damages herein at $3,140.70, and judgment is hereby rendered against the defendant in favor of the plaintiff of the sum of $3,140.70, with interest from the first day of this term of court.'\n\n The company took the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals upon writ of error, that court reversed the judgment of the District Court, holding that the company was entitled to the deduction of 48.75 cents per ton upon each ton of ore mined, as so much depletion of capital assets. \n\n[247 U.S. 116, 123]\n\u00a0\n 242 Fed. 9, 154 C. C. A. 601. This conclusion was reached upon a construction of the lease in view of the character of the mining property involved, and largely because of the fact that the quantity of the ore in place could be estimated with substantial accuracy. The court held that the selling price of the ore in any one year so far as it represented the actual value to the mining company of the ore in the ground on January 1, 1909, was not income within the meaning of the Corporation Tax Act of 1909. In the course of its opinion the Circuit Court of Appeals announced the decisive question of law to be:\n'So far as the selling price of the ore in 1910 represented its actual value to the company in the ground on January 1, 1909, was it income or was it the sale price of capital assets?'\n\n And after dealing with the character of this lease and the property covered by it, said:\n'We think that the lessee of such property and under such a lease is as much entitled as is the owner of the fee to treat the value of his interest in the ore in the ground at the beginning of the tax period as his capital-indeed, the lessee's right to do so, is, in some respects, the stronger of the two, as hereafter pointed out. Such a lease, as applied to this situation, is in every substantial way pro tanto a purchase.'\n\n This view of the character of these instruments and their legal effect differs from that taken by this court in the Sargent Land Company Case, \n242 U.S. 503\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 201, wherein precisely similar iron ore leases were under consideration. In that case this court reached the conclusion that such leases were not conveyances of the ore in place, but were grants of the privilege of entering upon, discovering, and developing and removing the minerals from the land, and that the lessor's income from such operations was obtained by a corporation shown to be carrying on business, and upon principles laid down in previous cases in this court (Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, supra; Stanton \n\n[247 U.S. 116, 124]\n\u00a0\n v. Baltic Mining Company, \n240 U.S. 103\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 278) that such income was subject to taxation under the Corporation Tax Act of 1909.\n In the Sargent Land Company Case it was pointed out that the courts of Minnesota, certainly familiar with the physical characteristics of the ore deposits involved, had in a series of cases held these instruments to be leases, and that the royalties agreed to be paid ere rentals in compensation for the privileges granted the lessee. We held the conclusion of the Minnesota courts to be warranted by reason and authority. \n242 U.S. 503\n, and cases cited in margin, page 518, 37 Sup. Ct. 201.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals distinguished the Sargent Land Company Case, and of it said:\n'Finally, it is urged that this case is controlled by the decision of the Supreme Court in the Sargent Land Company Case. The mining leases involved in that case and in this one seem to be identical in substance, and it is now said with great plausibility that the ore in the ground and affected by such a lease belongs partly to the lessor and partly to the lessee, and that, if the interest of the lessor is not capital assets no more is the interest of the lessee, and that, if the receipts of the former are income so must those of the latter be. We are convinced that the analogy between the two cases is superficial and not substantial. In that case the Supreme Court had to determine whether the royalties received by the lessor were income or were a depletion of capital. Many considerations led to the conclusion that they must be treated as income. The contract was a 'lease,' the receipts were 'royalties,' and royalties, being rentals, are inherently income and have been commonly so considered. All these things seem to have affected the conclusion of the court, but, after all the dominating thought appears to be that, when land is devoted to mining it is put to only one of those productive uses of which it is capable, and that the product of \n\n[247 U.S. 116, 125]\n\u00a0\n the use should be called income. The land itself is the chief thing. After the mining is finished the land remains suitable for other uses; and the fact-if it is a fact-that the minerals are the greater part of its value cannot operate to make the incidental overshadow the principal. These reasons do not apply at all to the case of the lessee whose existing interest, at the beginning of the taxing period, over and above the royalty which he must pay, amounted to $3,000,000; his entire interest was each year, as far as he went, consumed and exhausted forever; he did not have remaining the principal thing, the land, which he could put to some other use; the receipt in 1910 of his January 1, 1909, interest in the ore was not the offshoot and income of his property; it was the transformation and eating up of the very property, and of the whole of it. We therefore think that applying the principle of the Sargent Case results in holding that these receipts were from the sale of capital assets and not from income.'\n\n We are unable to concur in this view expressed in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals as to the effect of the Sargent Land Company Case. Certainly this court had not in mind the distinction suggested. In the Sargent Land Company Case the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found that the land including the ore in it was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and without the right to the ore the land was worth practically nothing. 219 Fed. 38, 134 C. C. A. 649. This finding, as well as facts of general knowledge leave little room to suppose that this court made its decision concerning the rights of the lessor influenced by the fact that the land itself was the chief thing, and the ownership of it after the exhaustion of the minerals one of the controlling reasons in reaching the conclusion announced in that case. The lessee takes from the property the ore mined, paying for the privilege so much per ton for each ton removed. He has this right or privilege under the form of lease here involved so long \n\n[247 U.S. 116, 126]\n\u00a0\n as he sees fit to hold the same without exercising the privilege of cancellation therein contained. He is, as we held in the Sargent Land Company Case, in no legal sense a purchaser of ore in place.\n In this case the government took no writ of error as to the partial deduction allowed by the District Court, it follows that the correctness of that ruling is not op n here. The Circuit Court of Appeals erred in making the additional allowance for capital depletion. It follows that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed, and that of the District Court affirmed, and it is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. CLEVELAND, C, C & ST L R. CO.(1918)\nNo. 593\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Solicitor General Davis, of Washington, D. C., for the United states.\n Mr. George Hoadly, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In January, 1900, the respondent purchased 30,000 shares of stock of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company for $981,427.92, and sold them January 28, 1909, for $1,795,719-a profit of over $814,000. It included no portion of this profit in its return for the year 1909 under the Corporation Excise Tax Act of August 5, \n\n[247 U.S. 195, 196]\n\u00a0\n (chapter 6, 36 Stat. 11, 112,  38), and the United States brought this suit to recover the tax of 1 per cent. thereon. The District Court directed a verdict in favor of plaintiff. Upon review the Circuit Court of Appeals held the proceeds of sale of the stock could not be considered as income under the act except to the extent by which they exceeded the market value of the stock on December 31, 1908, ascertained to be $57 per share. It therefore reversed the judgment, and remanded the case with instructions to enter a new judgment to include a tax on this account only upon the balance of the selling price above $57 per share, or $1,710,000 in all. 242 Fed. 18. A writ of certiorari was then allowed.\n For reasons sufficiently stated in Doyle, Collector, v. Mitchell Brothers Co., \n247 U.S. 179\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 467, 62 L. Ed. --, and Hays, Collector, v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., \n247 U.S. 189\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 470, 62 L. Ed. --, this day decided, we concur in the view that defendant was not taxable except with respect to so much of the profit upon the stock as accrued after December 31, 1908. Just how this part is to be separated from that which previously accrued is a matter of some nicety, as we have shown in the Hays case. The Circuit Court of Appeals adopted the theory of an inventory taken as of the time the act went into effect; and although the assets here under consideration were not acquired for the purpose of sale in the manner of merchandise, but were bought for investment, and hence were not inventoried on December 31, 1908, it accepted the stipulated fact that the stock had a regular market value of $57 per share on that date as supplying the lack of an inventory. This result accords wi h the views we have expressed in the cases referred to.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","168":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. MORENA(1918)\nNo. 523\nArgued: December 13, 1917Decided: January 7, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 392, 393]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Fitts, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This certificate presents for construction certain sections of an Act of Congress passed June 29, 1906, and entitled 'An act to establish a Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, and to provide a uniform rule for the naturalization of aliens throughout the United States.' Chapter 3592, 34 Stat. 596.\n The pertinent parts of the act are as follows:\n'Sec. 4. That an alien may be admitted to and become a citizen of the United States in the following manner, and not otherwise:\n\n'First. He shall declare on oath before a clerk of any court authorized by this act to naturalize aliens, or his authorized deputy, in the district in which such alien resides, two years at least prior to his admission, and after he has reached the age of eighteen years, that it is bona fide his intention to become a citizen of the United States: ... Provided, however, that no alien who, in conformity with the law in force at the date of his declaration, has declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States shall be required to renew such declaration.\n\n'Second. Not less than two years nor more than seven years after he has made such declaration of intention he \n\n[245 U.S. 392, 394]\n\u00a0\n shall make and file, in duplicate a petition' for citizenship.\n\n The facts certified are these:\n Morena, on December 15, 1905, declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States and on December 21, 1914, filed in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania a petition for citizenship. On April 6, 1915, the petition was granted and he was admitted to citizenship.\n July, 1915, the United States filed in the District Court a bill praying that the order admitting Morena to citizenship be vacated and his certificate be canceled upon the ground, among others, that the certificate was void because it had been granted upon a petition filed more than seven years after he had made his declaration and more than seven years after the passage of the Act of Congress of June 29, 1906\n\n\n The District Court dismissed the bill and an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, reciting that there are conflicting decisions upon the construction of the act of Congress, has certified the following questions:\n'1. Is a declaration of intention made before the naturalization act of 1906 saved by the proviso of the first paragraph from the seven- year limitation of the second paragraph of section 4 of the act?\n\n'2. Is an alien who has made a declaration of intention before the act of 1906 required to file his petition for citizenship at a time not more than seven years after the date of such declaration of intention?\n\n'3. Is an alien who has made a declaration of intention before the act of 1906 required to file his petition for citizenship at a time not more than seven years after the date of the act?'\n\n The question in the case then, to state it succinctly, \n\n[245 U.S. 392, 395]\n\u00a0\n is whether the act of 1906 is applicable to declarations of intention made prior to its passage and to what extent applicable, if at all.\n That the question is susceptible of different answers is indicated by the diversity of views1 of the courts which have passed upon it.\n The cases that have answered the question in the negative have invoked in support of their view the presumption that statutes have prospective operation unless controlled by contrary intention clearly expressed and certain provisions of the act which indicate, it was said, that it was not the intention of Congress to invalidate a declaration of intention made prior to the act 'at any future time.' And one case adduces the contemporaneous construction of an administrative board.\n The words especially relied on are those of the proviso in the first paragraph of section 4 and those of section 8 (Comp. St. 1916,  4364).2 The latter \n\n[245 U.S. 392, 396]\n\u00a0\n may be disregarded. It prohibits the naturalization of aliens who cannot speak the English language, if physically able to do so, but preserves prior declarations if made in conformity with law in force at their date. The proviso of section 4 deserves more notice. It is that no alien whose declaration conformed to law when made 'shall be required to renew such declaration.' To this provision the cases we have summarized-and we refer to them because there is no brief on file for Morena-have ascribed the direct influence of excluding declarations theretofore made.\n We cannot assent to that view or to the view that if a limitation be put upon the time to complete the declaration by the final application for citizenship to can be construed as invalidating the declaration. It is no destruction of a right or privilege to limit the time for its assertion, and the cited provision does no more. Section 4 prescribes a time for completing the declaration, a time so liberal, regarding the privilege granted and the reason for granting and seeking it, as not to be considered in any just appreciation of words as even a limitation of it. And there was appealing purpose. There were reasons for diligence and reasons for giving to all declarations the same duration.\n It is to be remembered that the resolution of the alien to change his allegiance is expressed in his declaration. The interval of time between it and admission to citizenship is the precaution of the law to assure of qualification. In the old law this interval could not be less than two years, and so in the new law. Aside from this there was no other prescription in the old law of the time that should \n\n[245 U.S. 392, 397]\n\u00a0\n elapse between the declaration and the final petition. The minimum of time was preserved in the new law, but there was a maximum time prescribed for the completion of the declaration, and unless this was made applicable to 'old-law declarations' as well as to 'new-law declarations,' the act of 1906 would not do what its title declares it was intended to do-'provide a uniform rule for the naturalization of aliens throughout the United States.'\n A limitation of time even upon the assertion of a right theretofore having no limitation upon its assertion, or a different limitation, is not infrequent, and its legality is unquestionable if a time reasonable, in view of the subject-matter, be given. Wilson v. Iseminger, \n185 U.S. 55\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 573; Soper v. Anderson, \n201 U.S. 359\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 473; Blinn v. Nelson, \n222 U.S. 1\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 1, Ann. Cas. 1913B, 555. See, also, Sohn v. Waterson, 17 Wall. 596; Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Laramie Stockyards Co., \n231 U.S. 190\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 101. This being the power of Congress, there were, as we have seen, promptings to its exercise.\n The act, therefore, does not invalidate old declarations. It only specifies a time for their realization, a time ample to consider and estimate the value of realization, the extent of its duty and responsibility, a time determined and applied, therefore, upon full consideration; and we are not impressed with the argument that would assign an eternity of duration to prior declarations.\n The first question certified would seem to be addressed to the view that the act of 1906 made nugatory declarations theretofore filed. This, however, is not urged by the government and we consider it untenable for the reasons which we have already expressed. Such has been the ruling of the cases.\n We therefore answer the first and second questions in the negative and the third in the affirmative.\n And it is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The cases deciding that the seven-year limitation is applicable to prior declarations are as follows:\n In re Goldstein et al.

Rosalsky, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An indictment containing six counts charged defendant, Schider, with violating the Food & Drug Act of June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 768, c. 3915 [ Comp. St. 1916,  8717-8728]), by delivering for shipment in interstate commerce food contained in a bottle plainly labeled as follows: \n\n[246 U.S. 519, 520]\n\u00a0\n Compound\n Ess Grape\n Jos. L.

In fact, it contained nothing from grapes and was a mere imitation.\n Within the statute's general terms the article must be \n\n[246 U.S. 519, 522]\n\u00a0\n deemed adulterated since some other substance had been substituted wholly for the one indicated by the label; and, also, it was misbranded, for the label carried a false and misleading statement.\n Defendant relies on the proviso in section 8 which declares articles of food shall not be deemed adulterated or misbranded if they are 'labeled, branded, or tagged so as to plainly indicate that they are compounds, imitations, or blends and the word 'compound,' 'imitation,' or 'blend,' as the case may be, is plainly stated on the package in which it is offered for sale.' But we are unable to conclude that by simply using 'compound' upon his label a dishonest manufacturer exempts his wares from all inhibitions of the statute, and obtains full license to befool the public. Such a construction would defeat the highly beneficent end which Congress had in view.\n We have heretofore said:\n'The purpose of the act is to secure the purity of food and drugs and to inform purchasers of what they are buying. Its provisions are directed to that purpose and must be construed to effect it.' United States v. Antikamnia Co., \n231 \nU.S. 654, 665\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 222, 225 ( 58 L. Ed. 419, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 49). 'The legislation, as against misbranding, intended to make it possible that the consumer should know that an article purchased was what it purported to be; that it might be bought for what it really was and not upon misrepresentations as to character and quality.' United States v. Lexington Mill Co., \n232 \nU.S. 399, 409\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 337, 340 (58 L. Ed. 658, L. R. A. 1915B, 774).\n\n And see United States v. Coca-Cola Co., \n241 \nU.S. 265, 277\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 573, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 487.\n The stuff put into commerce by defendant was an 'imitation' and if so labeled purchasers would have had some notice. To call it 'compound essence of grape' certainly did not suggest a mere imitation but on the contrary falsely indicated that it contained something derived from grapes. See Frank v. United States, 192 Fed. 864, 113 C. C. A. 188. The statute enjoins truth; this label exhales deceit. \n\n[246 U.S. 519, 523]\n\u00a0\n The trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer.

SOLDANA(1918)\nNo. 325\nArgued: March 4, 1918Decided: April 15, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Warren, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Act of January 30, 1897, c. 109 (29 Stat. 506),1 makes it a criminal offense to introduce intoxicating liquors 'into the Indian country.' For violating that law, Soldana and Herrera were indicted in the District Court of the United States for the District of Montana. The indictment \n\n[246 U.S. 530, 531]\n\u00a0\n charged that the liquor was introduced 'within the exterior boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation' in that state, but upon 'the station platform of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway Company, at the town of Crow Agency' upon the right of way of said railroad. Defendants demurred, contending that the station platform was not within Indian country, and that, therefore, no offense was alleged. The District Court sustained the demurrer and discharged the prisoners. The case came here under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (Comp. St. 1916,  1704).\n Crow Indian Reservation consists of nearly two and a half million acres located in the southwestern part of Montana. The government agency is at Crow agency which lies north of the middle of the reservation on the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway, which runs through the heart of the reservation from north to south. The right of way is one hundred and fifty feet wide except where additional ground is allowed for stations. Whether or not the station platform is Indian country depends upon the construction to be given to the act of Congress granting the right of way. If the Indian title to the soil on which the platform stands was extinguished by that grant, the platform was not within Indian country. Bates v. Clark, \n95 U.S. 204\n.2 Did the statutes except from the reservation the land on which the railroad was built and extinguish the Indian title, or did they merely give to the company a right of way or other limited interest in the land on which to construct and operate a railroad? \n\n[246 U.S. 530, 532]\n\u00a0\n The statutes to be considered are Act of May 1, 1888, c. 213 (25 Stat. 113) confirming the establishment of the reservation, and Act of February 12, 1889, c. 134 (25 Stat. 660), granting a right of way through the reservation to the Big Horn Southern Railroad. Whatever rights it acquired were transferred to the Burlington under Act of March 1, 1893, c. 192 (27 Stat. 529).\n The act of 1888 provided that whenever, in the opinion of the President, public interests require the construction of railroads through any portion of the reservation, the 'right of way shall be, and is hereby, granted for such purposes, under such rules, regulations, limitations, and restrictions as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe.' The act of 1889 provided, by section 3, that 'the surveys, construction, and operation of such railroad shall be conducted with due regard for the rights of the Indians and in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may make to carry out this provision.' Section 5 declared that the grant of the right of way was upon the expressed condition that the grantee and its successors 'wil neither aid, advise, nor assist in any effort looking towards the changing or extinguishing the present tenure of the Indians in their land, and will not attempt to secure from the Indian tribes any further grant of land or its occupancy than is hereinbefore provided: Provided, that any violation of the condition mentioned in this section shall operate as a forfeiture of all the rights and privileges of said railroad company under this act.'\n Whether these acts should be held to have granted a mere easement or a limited fee or some other limited interest in the land (New Mexico v. United States Trust Co., \n172 U.S. 171\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 128; Northern Pacific Railway v. Townsend, \n190 U.S. 267\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 671; Rio Grande Western Railway v. Stringham, \n239 U.S. 44\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 5), it is clear that it was not the purpose of Congress to extinguish the title of the Indians in \n\n[246 U.S. 530, 533]\n\u00a0\n the land comprised within the right of way. To have excepted this strip from the reservation would have divided it into two, and would have rendered it much more difficult, if not impossible, to afford that protection to the Indians which the provisions quoted were designed to insure. The case of Clairmont v. United States, \n225 U.S. 551\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 787, which is the basis of the decision in United States v. Lindahl (D.

Hackett, of Washington, D. C., and Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, for Spearin.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Thompson, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Spearin brought this suit in the Court of Claims demanding a balance alleged to be due for work done under a contract to construct a dry dock and also damages for its annulment. Judgment was entered for him in the sum of $141,180.86 (51 Ct. Cl. 155), and both parties appealed to this court. The government contends that Spearin is entitled to recover only $7, 907.98. Spearin claims the additional sum of $63,658.70.\n First. The decision to be made on the government's appeal depends upon whether or not it was entitled to annul the contract. The facts essential to a determination of the question are these:\n Spearin contracted to build for $757,800 a dry dock at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in accordance with plans and specifications which had been prepared by the government. The site selected by it was intersected by a 6- foot brick sewer; and it was necessary to divert and relocate a section thereof before the work of constructing the dry dock could begin. The plans and specifications provided that the contractor should do the work and prescribed the dimensions, material and location of the section to be \n\n[248 U.S. 132, 134]\n\u00a0\n substituted. All the prescribed requirements were fully complied with by Spearin; and the substituted section was accepted by the government as satisfactory. It was located about 37 to 50 feet from the proposed excavation for the dry dock; but a large part of the new section was within the area set aside as space within which the contractor's operations were to be carried on. Both before and after the diversion of the 6-foot sewer, it connected, within the Navy Yard but outside the space reserved for work on the dry dock, with a 7-foot sewer which emptied into Wallabout Basin.\n About a year after this relocation of the 6-foot sewer there occurred a sudden and heavy downpour of rain coincident with a high tide. This forced the water up the sewer for a considerable distance to a depth of 2 feet or more. Internal pressure broke the 6-foot sewer as so relocated, at several places; and the excavation of the dry dock was flooded. Upon investigation, it was discovered that there was a dam from 5 to 5 1\/2 feet high in the 7-foot sewer; and that dam, by diverting to the 6-foot sewer the greater part of the water, had caused the internal pressure which broke it. Both sewers were a part of the city sewerage system; but the dam was not shown either on the city's plan, nor on the government's plans and blueprints, which were submitted to Spearin. On them the 7-foot sewer appeared as unobstructed. The government officials concerned with the letting of the contract and construction of the dry dock did not know of the existence of the dam. The site selected for the dry dock was low ground; and during some years prior to making the contract sued on, the sewers had, from time to time, overflowed to the knowledge of these government officials and others. But the fact had not been communicated to Spearin by any one. He had, before entering into the contract, made a superficial examination of the premises and sought from the civil engineer's office at the Navy \n\n[248 U.S. 132, 135]\n\u00a0\n Yard information concerning the conditions and probable cost of the work; but he had made no special examination of the sewers nor special inquiry into the possibility to the work being flooded thereby, and had no information on the subject.\n Promptly after the breaking of the sewer Spearin notified the government that he considered the sewers under existing plans a menace to the work and that he would not resume operations unless the government either made good or assumed responsibility for the damage that had already occurred and either made such changes in the sewer system as would remove the danger or assumed responsibility for the damage which might thereafter be occasioned by the insufficient capacity and the location and design of the existing sewers. The estimated cost of restoring the sewer was $3,875. But it was unsafe to both Spearin and the government's property to proceed with the work with the 6-foot sewer in its then condition. The government insisted that the responsibility for remedying existing conditions rested with the contractor. After 15 months spent in investigation and fruitless correspondence, the Secretary of the Navy annulled the contract and took possession of the plant and materials on the site. Later the dry dock, under radically changed and enlarged plans, was completed by other contractors, the government having first discontinued the use of the 6- foot intersecting sewer and then reconstructed it by modifying size, shape and material so as to remove all danger of its breaking from internal pressure. Up to that time $210,939.18 had been expended by Spearin on the work; and he had received from the government on account thereof $129,758. 32. The court found that if he had been allowed to complete the contract he would have earned a profit of $60,000 and its judgment included that sum.\n The general rules of law applicable to these facts are well \n\n[248 U.S. 132, 136]\n\u00a0\n settled. Where one agrees to do, for a fixed sum, a thing possible to be performed, he will not be excused or become entitled to additional compensation, because unforeseen difficulties are encountered.

Thus one who undertakes to erect a structure upon a particular site, assumes ordinarily the risk of subsidence of the soil. Simpson v. United States, \n172 U.S. 372\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 222; Dermott v. Jones, 2 Wall. 1. But if the contractor is bound to build according to plans and specifications prepared by the owner, the contractor will not be responsible for the consequences of defects in the plans and specifications. MacKnight Flintic Stone Co. v. The Mayor, 160 N. Y. 72, 54 N. E. 661; Filbert v. Philadelphia, 181 Pa. 530;,* Bentley v. State, 73 Wis. 416, 41 N. W. 338. See Sundstrom v. State of New York, 213 N. Y. 68, 106 N. E. 924. This responsibility of the owner is not overcome by the usual clauses requiring builders to visit the site, to check the plans, and to inform themselves of the requirements of the work, as is shown by Christie v. United States, \n237 U.S. 234\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 565; Hollerbach v. United States, \n233 U.S. 165\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 553, and United States v. Stage Co., \n199 \nU.S. 414, 424\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 69, where it was held that the contractor should be relieved, if he was misled by erroneous statements in the specifications.\n In the case at bar, the sewer, as well as the other structures, was to be built in accordance with the plans and specifications furnished by the government. The construction of the sewer constituted as much an integral part of any part of the dry dock proper. struction of any part of the dry dock proper. It was as necessary as any other work in the preparation for the foundation. It involved no separate contract and no separate consideration. The contention of the government that the present case is to be distinguished from the Bentley Case, supra, and other similar cases on the ground that the contract with reference to the sewer is purely collateral is clearly without \n * 37 Atl. 545. \n\n[248 U.S. 132, 137]\n\u00a0\n merit. The risk of the existing system proving adequate might have rested upon Spearin, if the contract for the dry dock had not contained the provision for relocation of the 6-foot sewer. But the insertion of the articles prescribing the character, dimensions and location of the sewer imported a warranty that if the specifications were complied with, the sewer would be adequate. This implied warranty is not overcome by the general clauses requiring the contractor to examine the site,1 to check up the plans,2 and to assume responsibility for the work until completion and acceptance. \n3\n The obligation to examine the site did not impose upon him the duty of making a diligent inquiry into the history of the locality with a view to determining, at his peril, whether the sewer specifically prescribed by the government would prove adequate. The duty to check plans did not impose the obligation to pass upon their adequacy to accomplish the purpose in view. And the provision concerning contractor's responsibility cannot be construed as abridging rights arising under specific provisions of the contract.\n Neither section 3744 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. 1916,  6895) which provides \n\n[248 U.S. 132, 138]\n\u00a0\n that contracts of the Navy Department shall be reduced to writing, nor the parol evidence rule, precludes reliance upon a warranty implied by law. See Kellogg Bridge Co. v. Hamilton, \n110 U.S. 108\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 537. The breach of warranty, followed by the government's repudiation of all responsibility for the past and for making working conditions safe in the future, justified Spearin in refusing to resume the work. He was not obliged to restore the sewer and to proceed, at his peril, with the construction of the dry dock. When the government refused to assume the responsibility, he might have terminated the contract himself, Anvil Mining Co. v. Humble, \n153 \nU.S. 540, 551\n, 552 S., 14 Sup. Ct. 876; but he did not. When the government annulled the contract without justification, it became liable for all damages resulting from its breach.\n Second. Both the main and the cross appeal raise questions as to the amount recoverable.\n The government contends that Spearin should, as requested, have repaired the sewer and proceeded with the work; and that having declined to do so, he should be denied all recovery except $7,907.98, which represents the proceeds of that part of the plant which the government sold plus the value of that retained by it. But Spearin was under no obligation to repair the sewer and proceed with the work, while the government denied responsibility for providing and refused to provide sewer conditions safe for the work. When it wrongfully annulled the contract, Spearin became entitled to compensation for all losses resulting from its breach.\n Spearin insists that he should be allowed the additional sum of $63, 658.70, because, as he alleges, the lower court awarded him (in addition to $60,000 for profits) not the difference between his proper expenditures and his receipts from the government, but the difference between such receipts and the value of the work, materials, and plant (as reported by a naval board appointed by the defendant). \n\n[248 U.S. 132, 139]\n\u00a0\n Language in the findings of fact concerning damages lends possibly some warrant for that contention; but the discussion of the subject in the opinion makes it clear that the rule enunciated in United States v. Behan, \n110 U.S. 338\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 81, which claimant invokes, was adopted and correctly applied by the court.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is, therefore, affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration and decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '271.

SWEET(1918)\nNo. 99\nArgued: December 19, 1917Decided: January 28, 1918\n\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 563, 564]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful, for the United States.\n Messrs. A. C. Ellis, Jr., W. H. Dickson, and Albert R. Barnes, all of Salt Lake City, Utah, for appellee.\n\n\n[245 U.S. 563, 566]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the United States to quiet the title to section 32 of a designated township in Carbon county, Utah the suit being specially directed against a claim asserted by the defendant, as an assignee of the state, under the school land grant to the latter. Whether this tract passed to the state under that grant or was reserved to the United States as mineral land is the matter in controversy. In the District Court the United States prevailed as to all but 40 acres, but in the Circuit Court of Appeals that decree was reversed and one for the defendant was directed. 228 Fed. 421, 143 C. C. A. 3.\n The evidence shows that the entire section, excepting 40 acres, is valuable for coal and has been known to be so since before Utah became a state. Land valuable for coal is mineral land within the meaning of the public land laws. Thus the ultimate question for decision is whether the school land grant to Utah embraces mineral and. The grant is found in section 6 of the act of Congress of July 16, 1894, c. 138, 28 Stat. 107, and is copied in the margin 1 \n\n[245 U.S. 563, 567]\n\u00a0\n with another closely related section of the same act. It neither expressly includes mineral lands nor expressly excludes them. If it did either, it would be conclusive of the will of Congress upon the point. But, as it makes no mention of such lands, it is permissible-indeed, is essential-to inquire whether the congressional will is otherwise made manifest, that is to say, whether the general words of the grant are to be read in the light of other statutes and a settled public policy in respect of mineral lands.\n In the legislation concerning the public lands it has been the practice of Congress to make a distinction between mineral lands and other lands, to deal with them along different lines, and to withhold mineral lands from disposal save under laws specially including them. This practice began with the ordinance of May 20, 1785, 10 Journals of Congress ( Folwell's Ed.) 118, and was observed \n\n[245 U.S. 563, 568]\n\u00a0\n with such persistency in the early land laws2 as to lead this court to say in United States v. Gratiot, 14 Pet. 526, 'It has been the policy of the government, at all times, in disposing of the public lands, to reserve the mines for the use of the United States,' and also to hold in United States v. Gear, 3 How. 120, 838, that an act making no mention of lead-mind lands and providing generally for the sale of 'all the lands' in certain new land districts, 'reserving only' designated tracts, 'any law of Congress heretofore existing to the contrary notwithstanding,' could not be regarded as disclosing a purpose on the part of Congress to depart from 'the policy which had governed its legislation in respect to lead-mine lands,' and so did not embrace them. A like practice prevailed in respect of saline lands, and in Morton v. Nebraska, 21 Wall. 660, where a disposal of such lands under an act providing generally for the sale of lands in certain territories was drawn in question, this court said that it could not be supposed 'without an express declaration to that effect' that Congress intended by such an act to permit the sale of saline lands and thus to depart from 'a long-established policy by which it had been governed in similar cases.'\n While the early land laws occasionally and specially provided for the sale of mineral lands, they very generally evinced a purpose to reserve such lands for future disposal; and this purpose was given particular emphasis following the discovery of gold in California in 1848, as is shown in the Oregon Donation Act, the Homestead Act (which \n\n[245 U.S. 563, 569]\n\u00a0\n adopted the mineral land reservation of the Pre-emption Act of 1841), the grant to the several states for the benefit of agricultural colleges, the railroad land grants and other land acts of that period. \n3\n Noticeable among those acts is one which, in dealing with grants to Nevada and surveys in that state, declared, 'in all cases lands valuable for mines of gold, silver, quicksilver, or copper shall be reserved from sale,' chapter 166,  5, 14 Stat. 86, and another declaring, 'no act passed at the first session of the Thirty-Eighth Congress, granting lands to states or corporations, to aid in the construction of roads or for other purposes, or to extend the time of grants heretofore made, shall be so construed as to embrace mineral lands, which in all cases shall be, and are, reserved exclusively to the United States, unless otherwise specially provided in the act or acts making the grant.' 13 Stat. 567. Although applied in one instance to lands in Nevada and in the other to grants made at a particular session of Congress, these declarations were but expressive of the will of Congress that every grant of public lands, whether to a state or otherwise, should be taken as reserving and excluding mineral lands in the absence of an expressed purpose to include them; and upon this theory both declarations were carried into the Revised Statutes as being general and per- \n\n[245 U.S. 563, 570]\n\u00a0\n manent in their nature-the first in enlarged terms as section 2318 (Comp. St. 1916,  4613)4 and the other as section 2346 (section 4658).\n By the act of March 3, 1853, c. 145, 10 Stat. 244, Congress granted to the state of California sections 16 and 36 in each township for school purposes and large quantities of lands for other purposes. Mineral lands were neither expressly excepted from nor expressly included in the grant of the school sections, but were specially excepted from the other grants. This difference led to a controversy over the true meaning of the school grant, the state authorities taking the view that it did, and the land officers of the United States that it did not, include mineral lands. Ultimately the controversy came before this court in Mining Co. v. Consolidated Mining Co., \n102 U.S. 167\n, and the position taken by the land officers of the United States was sustained, the court saying (\n102 U.S. 174\n):\n'Taking into consideration what is well known to have been the hesitation and difficulty in the minds of Congressmen in dealing with these mineral lands, the manner in which the question was suddenly forced upon them, the uniform reservation of them from survey, from sale, from pre-emption, and above all from grants, whether for railroads, public buildings, or other purposes, and looking to the fact that from all the grants made in this act they are reserved, one of which is for school purposes besides the sixteenth and thirty- sixth sections, we are forced to the conclusion that Congress did not intend to depart from its uniform policy in this respect in the grant of those sections to the state.\n\n'It follows from the finding of the court and the undisputed facts of the case, that the land in controversy being mineral land, and well known to be so when the surveys of it were made, did not pass to the state under the school-section grant.' \n\n[245 U.S. 563, 571]\n\u00a0\n That ruling was reaffirmed and followed in Mullan v. United States, \n118 U.S. 271\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 1041, where valuable coal lands, known to be such, were held not to be open to selection by the state as indemnity school lands.\n\n The conditions ensuing from the discovery of gold and other minerals in the western states and territories resulted in a general demand for a system of laws expressly opening the mineral lands to exploration, occupation and acquisition, and Congress, responding to this demand, adopted from 1864 to 1873 a series of acts dealing with practically every phase of the subject and covering all classes of mineral lands, including coal lands. \n5\n These acts, with some before noticed, were carried into a chapter of the Revised Statutes entitled 'Mineral Lands and Mining Resources.' Taken collectively they constitute a special code upon that subject and show that they are intended not only to establish a particular mode of disposing of mineral lands, but also to except and reserve them from all other grants and modes of disposal where there is no express provision for their inclusion. Thus the policy of disposing of mineral lands only under laws specially including them became even more firmly established than before, and this is recognized in our decisions. Mining Co. v. Consolidated Mining Co., supra, \n102 U.S. 174\n; Deffeback v. Hawke, \n115 \nU.S. 392, 402\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 95; Davis v. Weibbold, \n139 \nU.S. 507, 516\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 628, 35 L. Ed 238. And while the mineral-land laws are not applicable to all the public land state, some being specially excepted,6 there has been no time to all the public land states, some being applicable to Utah. \n\n[245 U.S. 563, 572]\n\u00a0\n Another statute indicative of the policy of Congress and pertinent to the present inquiry is the act of February 28, 1891, c. 384, 26 Stat. 796 ( Comp. St. 1916,  4860, 4861), which defines the indemnity to which a state or territory is entitled in respect of its school grant. In addition to dealing with deficiencies occurring in other ways, it provides, 'And other lands of equal acreage are also hereby appropriated and granted, and may be selected by said state or territory where sections sixteen or thirty-six are mineral lands.' In this there is a plain implication that where those sections are mineral-known to be so when the grant takes effect-they do not pass under the grant. And it does not militate against this implication that under another provision the state may surrender those sections and take other lands in lieu of them where, although not known to be mineral when the grant takes effect, they are afterwards discovered to be so. See California v. Deseret Oil Co., \n243 U.S. 415\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 394.\n What has been said demonstrates that the school grant to Utah must be read in the light of the mining laws, the school land indemnity law and the settled public policy respecting mineral lands, and not as though it constituted the sole evidence of the legislative will. United States v. Barnes, \n222 \nU.S. 513, 520\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 117. When it is so read it does not, in our opinion, disclose a purpose to include mineral lands. Although couched in general terms adequate to embrace such lands if there were no statute or settled policy to the contrary, it contains no language which explicitly or clearly withdraws the designated sections, where known to be mineral in character, from the operation of the mining laws, or which certainly shows that Congress intended to depart from its long prevailing policy of disposing of mineral lands only under laws specially including them. \n\n[245 U.S. 563, 573]\n\u00a0\n It therefore must be taken as neither curtailing those laws nor departing from that policy.\n This conclusion is fortified by other considerations. When the grant was made Utah was known to be rich in minerals and salines. Besides this grant the act contains others aggregating 1,570,080 acres. In none is there any mention of mineral lands. As to 110,000 acres there is an express inclusion of saline lands. This silence as to mineral lands, when contrasted with the special inclusion of saline lands, indicates that the former are not included. See montello Salt Co. v. Utah, \n221 \nU.S. 452, 466\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 706, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 633. The committees of Congress, upon whose recommendation the act was passed, construed it as not embracing mineral lands, for in their reports7 they stated that 'All mineral lands are exempt from any grant made under the act.' The land department has uniformly placed the same construction upon it. \n8\n And Congress acted upon that construction when, by the act of May 3, 1902, c. 683, 32 Stat. 188 (Comp. St. 1916,  4866, 4867), it declared that as to the state of Utah 'all the provisions' of the school land indemnity law of February 28, 1891, before noticed, should apply to sections 2 and 32 as well as to sections 16 and 36-the grant to that state latter two as in other Western states.\n The case of Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, is relied upon as making for a different conclusion. Part of a school section in Michigan known to be mineral was there in controversy and was held to have passed to the state under its school grant. At the time the section was surveyed, which was the date when the grant was to take effect, there was a statute which in a single section provided for \n\n[245 U.S. 563, 574]\n\u00a0\n the sale of mineral lands, and also of other lands, and concluded with a reservation of the school sections 'from such sales.' The real question was whether those sections were reserved from both classes of sales, and this the court answered in the affirmative. Some observations in the opinion are not in accord with our present conclusion. These were relied upon in Mining Co. v. Consolidated Mining Co., supra, as our records show, and were in effect disapproved. Besides, when they were made the public policy respecting mineral lands had not been expressed in general and permanent la s, such as were afterwards enacted and carried into the Revised Statutes. See Lindley on Mines (3d Ed.)  136. The case, therefore, is neither controlling nor persuasive here.\n It results that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 6.

WEITZEL(1918)\nNo. 567\nArgued: March 7, 1918Decided: April 15, 1918\n\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Warren, for the United States.[ U S v. Weitzel \n246 U.S. 533\n (1918) ]\n\n\n[246 U.S. 533, 540]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. E. Stricklett, of Covington, Ky., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Comptroller of the Currency is charged with the duty of supervising national banks. When he deems it necessary to take possession of the assets of a bank and assume control of its operations, he appoints a receiver under Revised Statutes,  5234 (Comp. St. 1916,  9821). Weitzel, so appointed receiver, was indicted in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Kentucky under Revised Statutes ,  5209 (Comp. St. 1916,  9772), for embezzlement and making false entries. That section does not mention receivers, but provides that 'every president, director, cashier, teller, clerk, or agent' \n\n[246 U.S. 533, 541]\n\u00a0\n of a national bank who commits these offences shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than five nor more than ten years. The government contended that the receiver was an 'agent' within the meaning of the act. A demurrer to the indictment was sustained on the ground that he is not. The court discharged the prisoner and the case comes here under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (Comp. St. 1916,  1704).\n The receiver, unlike a presid nt, director, cashier, or teller, is an officer, not of the corporation, but of the United States. In re Chetwood, \n165 \nU.S. 443, 458\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 385. As such he gives to the United States a bond for the faithful discharge of his duties; pays to the Treasurer of the United States moneys collected; and makes to the Comptroller reports of his acts and proceedings. Revised Statutes,  5234. Being an officer of the United States he is represented in court by the United States attorney for the district, subject to the supervision of the Solicitor of the Treasury. Section 380 (Comp. St. 1916,  556); Gibson v. Peters, \n150 U.S. 342\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 134. And because he is such officer, a receiver has been permitted to sue in the federal court regardless of citizenship or of the amount in controversy. Price v. Abbott ( C. C.) 17 Fed. 506. In a sense he acts on behalf of the bank. The appointment of a receiver does not dissolve the corporation. Chemical National Bank v. Hartford Deposit Co., \n161 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 439; the assets remain its property, Rosenblatt v. Johnston, \n104 U.S. 462\n; the receiver deals with the assets and protects them for whom it may concern, including the stockholders; and his own compensation and expenses are a charge upon them. Section 5238 (Comp. St. 1916,  9825). But a receiver is appointed only when the condition of the bank or its practices makes intervention by the government necessary for the protection of noteholders or other creditors. \n1\n While the receivership continues the corporation is precluded from \n\n[246 U.S. 533, 542]\n\u00a0\n dealing by its officers or agents in any way with its assets. And when all creditors are satisfied or amply protected the receiver may be discharged by returning the bank to the control of its stockholders or by the appointment of a liquidating agent under Act of June 30, 1876, c. 156, 19 Stat. 63. Whether, as the government assumes, such statutory agent who is elected by the stockholders is included under term 'agent' as used in section 5209, we have no occasion to determine. The question was expressly left undecided in Jewett v. United States, 100 Fed. 832, 840, 41 C. C. A. 88, 53 L. R. A. 568. But the assumption, if correct, would not greatly aid its contention. The law can conceive of an agent appointed by a superior authority; but the term 'agent' is ordinarily used as implying appointment by a principal on whose behalf he acts. The fact that in this section the words 'clerk or agent' follow 'president, director, cashier, teller' tends, under the rule of noscitur a sociis, to confirm the inference. United States v. Salen, \n235 \nU.S. 237, 249\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 51. Furthermore, the term 'agent of a bank' would ill describe the office of receiver.\n Section 5209 is substantially a reenactment of section 52 of the Act of February 25, 1863, c. 58, 12 Stat. 665, 680, the first National Bank Act. It is urged by the government, that the punishment of defalcation by a receiver is clearly within the reason of the statute and that, unless the term 'agent' be construed as including receivers, there was no federal statute under which an embezzling receiver of a national bank could have been prosecuted, at least until the Act of February 3, 1879, c. 42, 20 Stat. 280, (Comp. St. 1916,  10265), made officers of the United States so liable therefor; and, indeed, cannot now be, because he should not be held to be an officer. The argument is not persuasive. Congress may possibly have believed that a different rule should be applied to an officer of the United States who is selected by the Comptroller for a purpose largely different from the performed by officers of the bank, and who gives bond for the \n\n[246 U.S. 533, 543]\n\u00a0\n faithful discharge of his duties. Furthermore a casus omissus is not unusual, particularly in legislation introducing a new system. \n2\n The fact that in 1879 Congress should have found it necessary to enact a general law for the punishment of officers of the United  ates who embezzle property entrusted to them, but not owned by the United States, shows both how easily a casus omissus may arise and how long a time may elapse before the defect is discovered or is remedied. Statutes creating and defining crimes are not to be extended by intendmant because the court thinks the legislature should have made them more comprehensive. Todd v.

WHITED & WHELESS(1918)\nNo. 204\nArgued: Decided: April 15, 1918\n\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful, for the United States.[ U S v. Whited & Wheless \n246 U.S. 552\n (1918) ]\n\n\n[246 U.S. 552, 556]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. Alexander and J. D. Wilkinson, both of Shreveport, La., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[246 U.S. 552, 560]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover from the liquidating commissioners and the former president of a dissolved corporation the value of public lands described in a patent which it is alleged was procured from the government by the fraudulent conduct of the company and of its president.\n A demurrer to the petition was sustained by the District Court, and this judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that the cause of action stated was barred by the statute of limitations, which reads as follows:\n'That suits by the United States to vacate and annul any patent heretofore issued shall only be brought within five years from the passage of this act, and suits to vacate and annul patents hereafter issued shall only be brought within six years after the date of the issuance of such patents.' Act March 3, 1891, c. 561,  8, 26 Stat. 1099 (Comp. St. 1916,  5114).\n\n The patent involved was issued on December 12, 1898, and if this case, commenced on December 29, 1914, were one 'to vacate and annul' the patent, plainly it would be barred. But this being a suit to recover damages from the fraudulent procurers of the patent, the question presented for decision is:\n'Does the statutory bar to a suit to annul the patent also bar a suit for the value of the land fraudulently procured to be patented?'\n\n The chief argument in support of the judgment of the lower court is that while the government before the period of the statute had expired had two remedies, one to annul the patent and one, affirming the patent, to recover the value of the land, yet they were both based on one right, and that when the statute barred the suit to annul, thereby the patent became as valid for the future \n\n[246 U.S. 552, 561]\n\u00a0\n as if it had been properly issued and that this cuts off the right, and leaves the government without further remedy.\n This is begging the question. The statute of limitations did not create the right of action in the government or either of the remedies for enforcing that right. It relates to the remedy, and in terms applies only to one remedy, that for annulling the patent. The right of the government, asserted in this case, really springs from the fraudulent obtaining of the patent, not from the patent itself, and this right continues until it is satisfied or cut off by statute, and therefore to say that the barring of one remedy smothers the right to pursue the other is mere assertion, and does not advance us toward a conclusion as to the effect, if any, which such bar may have upon the other remedy, and the question we are considering remains unanswered, but becomes: What was the intention of Congress, confessedly not clearly expressed, with respect to this issue, when it enacted this limitation statute?\n Fundamental to the interpretation of the statute which the answering of this question renders necessary, lies the rule of law settled 'as a great principle of public policy' that the 'United States, asserting rights vested in them as a sovereign government, are not bound by any statute of limitations, unless Congress has clearly manifested its intention that they should be so bound' (United States v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co., \n118 \nU.S. 120, 125\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 1006), and also the fact that this principle has been accepted by this court as requiring not a liberal, but a restrictive, a strict, construction of such statutes when it has been urged to apply them to bar the rights of the government. Thus, in Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 355, 367\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 368, the limitation in the Act of March 2, 1896 (29 Stat. 42, c. 29), was hold not applicable to a patent erroneously issued for In ian lands under a railroad grant, and in La Roque v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 62, 68\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 22, the general language of the very act we \n\n[246 U.S. 552, 562]\n\u00a0\n are considering was held not applicable to a trust patent for Indian reserved lands.\n With this rule of interpretation and of practice under it in mind, let us consider the scope of the limitation provision relied upon, which is found in section 8 of the Act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 1099, c. 561) entitled 'An act to repeal timber culture laws and for other purposes.'\n This act is a very considerable amendment to and revision of laws relating to public lands and, as House Report No. 253, 54th Congress, 1st Session, shows, it grew out of the insecurity and loss of confidence of the public in the integrity and value of patent titles to public lands, which had been occasioned by conflicting claims, chiefly between land grant railroad companies and the government, which had resulted in many suits being commenced to cancel patents. The statute was passed to promote prompt action for annulling patents where cause therefor was believed to exist and to make titles resting upon patents dependably secure when the period of limitation should expire. As might well be anticipated, therefore, this statute, originating in such conditions, was limited in its terms to suits 'to vacate and annul' patents, without any reference being made to suits to recover the value of the land when patents were fraudulently obtained, so that only by extravagant interpretation can its bar be made applicable to such suits-and such interpretation we have seen is forbidden.\n To this we add that when the Congress really intended to bar by limitation statute the right to recover the value of lands, as well as the lands themselves, such intention found clear expression in the Act of March 2, 1896 (29 Stat. 42), which modified, and in a measure is a substitute for, the section we are considering, by declaring:\n'That no suit shall be brought or maintained, nor shall recovery be had for lands or the value thereof, that were certified or patented in lieu of other lands,' etc. \n\n[246 U.S. 552, 563]\n\u00a0\n And, finally, the decisions of this court furnish clear confirmation of the reality and substantial character of the contention of the government, by holding that when by mistake public officers executed a patent to a railroad company for lands which had afterwards been conveyed to purchasers dealing in good faith, the right of the government to recover such lands was barred, but nevertheless the right remained to sue for and recover the value of the lands so wrongfully received and conveyed. Southern Pacific R. R. Co. v. United States, \n200 \nU.S. 341, 353\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 296.\n\n Thus the rule and practice for interpreting the act, its language, as well that which is omitted from it as that which is contained in it, and the action of Congress in dealing with a kindred subject-matter, all impel to the conclusion that the omission of language barring the right of the government to recover the value of lands to which a patent had been fraudulently obtained, was intentional and deliberate, to the end that patent titles might be made secure but that persons who had defrauded the government should not be protected by the act in the enjoyment of their ill-gotten gains.\n The support for the contention of the defendants in error, contrary to this conclusion, which they claim to find in United States v. Chandler- Dunbar Water Power Co., \n209 U.S. 447\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 579, is based upon the statement that by the statute 'the patent is ... to have the same effect against the United States that it would have had if it had been valid in the first place.' But that is merely an emphatic way of saying that the title is made good. It does not import that the collateral effects of fraud in obtaining the patent are purged. The element of bad faith or fraud was expressly excluded.\n While the Circuit Court of Appeals, as we have stated, rested its de ision wholly upon the limitation statute, yet, under warrant of the claim in the demurrer that the petition does not state a cause of action, it is further ar- \n\n[246 U.S. 552, 564]\n\u00a0\n gued in this court, that if it be conceded that the right of recovery by the government is not barred, nevertheless such recovery is limited by section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1896 (29 Stat. 42), to the minimum government price for the land, and since the petition shows that this amount was paid to the government when the patent was issued, there can be no recovery.\n But the act of 1896 deals only with patents 'erroneously issued under a railroad or wagon-road grant' and the limited recovery allowed is restricted to cases where it shall appear that such erroneously patented lands have been sold to bona fide purchasers. That such a statute can have no application to such a case as we are considering is too obvious for comment.\n This doctrine, that where there are two remedies for the protection of a right one may be barred and the other not, is no novelty in the law. So long ago as 5 Pickering, in Lamb v. Clark, pages 193, 198, it was tersely stated as then familiar doctrine that 'If an injured party has a right to either of two actions, the one he chooses is not barred, because the other, if he had brought it, might have been.' And the principle has frequently been recognized by this and other courts. Lewis v. Hawkins, 23 Wall. 119, 127; Hardin v. Boyd, \n113 \nU.S. 756, 765\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 771; Kirkman v. Philips' Heirs, 7 Heisk. (Tenn.) 222, 224; Ivey's Administrator v. Owens, 28 Ala. 641, 649; Ganley v. Troy City Nat. Bank, 98 N. Y. 487, 494.\n The conclusions we are here announcing are in entire accord with well- considered opinions by two Circuit Courts of Appeal, that of the Eighth Circuit, in United States v. Koleno, 226 Fed. 180, 141 C. C. A. 178, and in Union Coal & Coke Company v. United States (C. C. A.) 247 Fed. 106, and that of the Ninth Circuit in Bistline v. United States, 229 Fed. 546, 144 C. C. A. 6.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","175":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. WOO JAN(1918)\nNo. 586\nArgued: Decided: January 28, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Fitts, for the United States.\n Mr. Francis R. Marvin, of Cleveland, Ohio, for Woo Jan.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion o the Court.\n The Immigration Act of February 20, 1907, c. 1134, 34 Stat. 898 (Comp. St. 1916,  4270), provides as follows:\n'Sec. 21. That in case the Secretary of ... \n\n[245 U.S. 552, 553]\n\u00a0\n Labor shall be satisfied that an alien has been found in the United States in violation of this act, or that an alien is subject to deportation under the provisions of this act, or of any law of the United States [italics ours], he shall cause such alien within the period of three years after landing or entry to be taken into custody and returned to the country whence he came. ...'\n\n It is provided, however (section 43 [section 4289]):\n'That this act shall not be construed to repeal, alter, or amend existing laws relating to the immigration or exclusion of Chinese persons or persons of Chinese descent. ...'\n\n The relation of these sections has given rise to diversity of decision, District Courts of different districts and Circuit Courts of Appeals for different circuits being in opposition. Ex parte Woo Shing (N. D. Ohio), 226 Fed. 141, sustains the power of the Secretary of Labor exercised under section 21, and the decision was approved by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Lo Pong v. Dunn, 235 Fed. 510, 149 C. C. A. 56; Sibray v. United States, 227 Fed. 1, 141 C. C. A. 555. The power of the Secretary was denied in the instant case by the District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky (228 Fed. 927), and the decision has been followed by the Circuit Courts of Appeals for the Seventh and Fifth Circuits. United States v. United States ex rel. Lem Him, 239 Fed. 1023, 152 C. C. A. 661; Lee Wong Hin v. Mayo, 240 Fed. 368, 153 C. C. A. 294.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, reciting this diversity, certifies to this court the following questions, '(a in the abstract, b concretely)':\n'(a) Has the Secretary of Labor, acting within three years from the last entry, jurisdiction to arrest and deport a Chinese alien upon the sole ground that he is found in this country in violation of the Chinese Exclusion Act?\n\n'(b) Are the facts stated in Woo Jan's petition and admitted by demurrer inconsistent with any jurisdiction in the Department of Labor to cause his arrest and deportation?' \n\n[245 U.S. 552, 554]\n\u00a0\n The answer that is received to '(a)' determines the answer to '(b)'. In other words, if the first be answered 'No,' the second will necessarily be answered 'Yes,' the second being, as indicated by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the concrete application of the abstraction of the first.\n\n The facts are these: The Secretary of Labor, attempting to exercise the power supposed to be conferred upon him by section 21, caused the arrest of Woo Jan as a Chinese alien unlawfully within the United States, with the view and purpose of deporting him. The warrant of arrest recited 'that the said alien is unlawfully within the United States in that he is found therein in violation of the Chinese Exclusion Laws, and is, therefore, subject to deportation under the provisions of section 21' of the act of Congress of February 20, 1907, amended by the act of March 26, 1910 (Comp. St. 1916,  4244, 4247). It was directed to the 'Inspector in Charge, Cleveland, Ohio, or to any immigrant inspector in the service of the United States.'\n Woo Jan petitioned the District Court in habeas corpus to be discharged from the arrest, asserting his right to be and remain in the United States and setting up as grounds of it that he was a merchant, and that his status as a resident had been investigated by the authorities of the United States and established, and that there was no authority of law for the issue of the warrant. To the petition the District Attorney demurred, and the court, holding that the warrant had been issued without authority of law, ordered the discharge of Woo Jan. The case, therefore, presents to us through the questions certified the validity of the judgment.\n We are admonished at the outset by the diversity of opinion that there are grounds for opposing contentions. Indeed sections 21 and 43 seem to be, at first impression, in irreconcilable conflict. The declaration of section 21 is that the power of the Secretary of Labor shall extend to taking into custody and returning to the country from whence \n\n[245 U.S. 552, 555]\n\u00a0\n he came whoever is subject to deportation under the provisions 'of any law of the United States.' The universality of the declaration would seem to preclude exception and compel a single judgment. But, passing on to section 43, we find another law preserved and kept in function, a function so firm and exclusive that it is provided that the act, of which section 21 is but a part, shall not be construed to 'repeal, alter or amend' it. Let us repeat the language:\n'Provided, that this act shall not be construed to repeal, alter, or amend existing laws relating to the immigration or exclusion of Chinese persons or persons of Chinese descent.'\n\n There is, therefore, an express qualification of the universality of section 21, indeed, from all of the provisions of the act the Chinese exclusion laws are excepted. They, the latter, are to stand in their integrity and efficacy. But it is asserted that they are so left to stand, and that section 21 only gives another remedy, and United States v. Wong You, \n223 U.S. 67\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 195, is cited, first as to the assertion, then as to the cited case.\n That we may estimate both we insert in the margin the provisions of the Exclusion Laws. \n1\n The government, \n\n[245 U.S. 552, 556]\n\u00a0\n confronted with those provisions, conceded at bar that the remedy of section 21 is not their equivalent. The difference is marked. It is the difference between administrative and judicial action; and the government recognized that the difference-we might say contrast-is the step on which it 'must fall down, or else o'erleap.' And necessarily so. Manifestly the remedy of section 21 has not the safeguards of impartiality and providence that the remedy of the Exclusion Laws has. Mere discretion prompts the first and last act of the former; the latter has the security of procedure and ultimate judgment of a judicial tribunal, where all action which precedes judgment is upon oath and has its assurance and sanctions.\n The remedies are too essentially different to be concurrent. And yet we are asked to decide that the law which permits the first, that is, permits the deportation of an \n\n[245 U.S. 552, 557]\n\u00a0\n alien simply upon the warrant or determination of an executive officer, is not an amendment or alteration of a law which prohibits it. And there can be no doubt of the result if such decision be made. The summary and direct remedy of section 21 will always be used. No Chinese person will be given the formal procedure of the Exclusion Laws with their safe guards. The cases demonstrate this and we cannot believe that Congress was insensible of it and left it possible. Nor can we ascribe to Congress a deliberately deceptive obscurity and an intention, by the use of words which can be given a double sense, to grant a right that can have no assertion. We must, indeed, assume that section 43 was intended to be sufficient of itself- fully exclusive and controlling.\n We might terminate the discussion here and leave the case to the explicit language of section 43 that section 21 (to pass at once to the particular) 'shall not be construed to alter, repeal or amend existing laws relating to the immigration or exclusion of Chinese persons.' The government, however, contends, as we have seen, that this court has decided to the contrary in United States v. Wong You, supra.\n The government's understanding of the case is erroneous. It concerned Chinese persons, but not the Exclusion Laws, and it was decided that such persons might offend against the Immigration Act and be subject to deporation by the Department of Labor if they should so offend. This was the extent of the decision, and its language was addressed to the contention that the latter act was applicable to all persons except Chinese because of section 43. The content on was declared to be untenable, and it was untenable. The case, therefore, is different from that at bar and the opinion was considerate of the difference, that is, considerate of the difference between the Immigration Act and the Exclusion Laws.\n This difference must be kept in mind. The Chinese Exclusion Laws have not the character or purpose of the Im- \n\n[245 U.S. 552, 558]\n\u00a0\n migration Act. They are addressed under treaty stipulations2 to laborers only. Other classes are not included in their limitation and it was provided by the treaty that the limitation or suspension of the entry of laborers should be reasonable. The questions therefore which could arise were deemed different from any under the Immigration Act, and the Exclusion Laws are adapted to them and their procedure is hence saved by section 43.\n We, therefore, answer question '(a)' No, and question '(b)' Yes.\n And it is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The act of May 6, 1882,  1, as amended by the act of July 5, 1884 ( 22 Stat. 58; 23 Stat. 115 [Comp.

Article II of the treaty is as follows:\n'Chinese subjects, whether proceeding to the United States as teachers, st dents, merchants or from curiosity, together with their body and household servants, and Chinese laborers who are now in the United States, shall be allowed to go and come at their own free will and accord, and shall be accorded all the rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are accorded to the citizens and subjects of the most favored nation.' 22 Stat. 827. \n\n\n\n\n\n","176":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.

The Supreme Court overruled plaintiff's contention that the portion of the tax that was in controversy, having been imposed upon income derived by plaintiff from interstate commerce, amounted to a burden upon that commerce, contravening the commerce clause of section 8 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States. 161 Wis. 211, 153 N. W. 241, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 421. And this is the sole question presented for our consideration.\n The act, which was passed under the authority of an amendment to the state Constitution (Income Tax Cases, 148 Wis. 456, 134 N. W. 673, 135 N. W. 164), imposes a tax upon incomes received during the year ending December 31, 1911, and annually thereafter; defines the term 'income' as including (a) rent of real estate; (b) interest derived from money loaned or invested in notes, mortgages, bonds, or other evidences of debt; (c) wages, salaries, and the like; (d) dividends or profits derived from stock, or from the purchase and sale of property acquired within three years previous, or from any business whatever; (e) royalties derived from the possession or use of franchises or legalized privileges; and (f) all other income derived from any source, except such as is exempted. There is a provision 'that any person engaged in business within and without the state shall, with respect to income other than that \n\n[247 U.S. 321, 324]\n\u00a0\n derived from rentals, stocks, bonds, securities or evidences of indebtedness, be taxed only upon that proportion of such income as is derived from business transacted and property located within the state,' which is to be determined in a particular manner specified in section 1770b, as far as applicable.\n Corporations are allowed to make certain deductions from gross income, including amounts paid for personal services of officers and employes and other ordinary expenses paid out of income in the maintenance and operation of business and property, including a reasonable allowance for depreciation, losses not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, taxes, etc. These need not be further mentioned, beyond saying that the intent and necessary effect of the act is to tax not gross receipts but net income; that from the stipulated facts it appears that the tax in question was imposed upon plaintiff's net income; and that this is in accord with the construction of the act adopted by the Supreme Court of the state in this and other cases. State ex rel. Manitowoc Gas Co. v. Wisconsin Tax Commission, 161 Wis. 111, 116, 152 N. W. 848; United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek (the present case) 161 Wis. 211, 221, 153 N. W. 241, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 421; State ex rel. Bundy v. Nygaard, 163 Wis. 307, 310, 158 N. W. 87, L. R. A. 1917E, 563.\n In order to determine what part of the income of a corporation engaged in business within and without the state (other than that derived from rentals, stocks, bonds, securities, etc.) is to be taxed as derived from business transacted and property located within the state, reference is had to a formula prescribed by another statute (section 1770b, subsec. 7, par. [e] of Wisconsin Stats. for apportioning the capital stock of foreign corporations, under which the gross business in dollars of the corporation in the state, added to the value in dollars of its property in the state, is made the numerator of a fraction of which the denominator consists of the total gross business in dollars of the corporation both within and wit out the state, added to the value in dollars of its property within and without the state. The resulting fraction is taken by the income tax law as representing the \n\n[247 U.S. 321, 325]\n\u00a0\n proportion of the income which is deemed to be derived from business transacted and property located within the state. This formula was applied in apportioning plaintiff's net 'business income' for the year 1911, and upon the portion thus attributed to the state, plus the income from rentals, stocks, bonds, etc., the tax in question was levied.\n Plaintiff was and is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Wisconsin, having its principal office and place of business in the town of Oak Creek, where it conducted an extensive manufacturing plant, selling its products throughout the state and in other states and foreign countries. Its net 'business income' in the year 1911, exclusive of that derived from rentals, stocks, bonds, etc., and after making the deductions allowed by the act, amounted to about $124,000, derived from the following sources: (a) About $16,000 from goods sold to customers within the state and delivered from its factory; (b) about $65,000 from goods sold to customers outside of the state and delivered from its factory; (c) about $ 31,000 from goods sold to customers outside of the state, the sales having been made and goods shipped from plaintiff's branches in other states, and the goods having been manufactured at plaintiff's factory and shipped before sale to said branches; (d) about $7,000 from goods sold to customers outside of the state, the sales having been made and goods shipped from plaintiff's branches without the state, these goods having been purchased by plaintiff outside of the state and shipped to plaintiff's factory in the state, and thence shipped before sale from the factory to the branches; (e) about $5,000 from goods sold outside of the state, the sales having been made and goods shipped from said branches, and the goods having been purchased by plaintiff outside of the state and shipped from the points of purchase to the branches without coming into the state of Wisconsin. \n\n[247 U.S. 321, 326]\n\u00a0\n No contention was made as to the taxability of the income designated in item (a). Plaintiff's contention that items (d) and (e) were not taxable because not derived from property located or business transacted within the state was upheld by the state courts. Thus the controversy is narrowed to the contention, overruled by the Supreme Court, that items (b) and (c) were not taxable because derived from interstate commerce.\n Stated concisely, the question is whether a state, in levying a general income tax upon the gains and profits of a domestic corporation, may include in the computation the net income derived from transactions in interstate commerce without contravening the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n It is settled that a state may not directly burden interstate commerce, either by taxation or otherwise. But a tax that only indirectly affects the profits or returns from such commerce is not within the rule. Thus, it was declared in Postal Tel. Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 \nU.S. 688, 695\n, 696 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 268, 269 (39 L. Ed. 311):\n'It is settled that where, by way of duties laid on the transportation of the subjects of interstate commerce, or on the receipts derived therefrom, or on the occupation or business of carrying it on, a tax is levied by a state on interstate commerce, such taxation amounts to a regulation of such commerce, and cannot be sustained. But property in a state belonging to a corporation, whether foreign or domestic, engaged in foreign or interstate commerce, may be taxed, or a tax may be imposed on the corporation on account of its property within a state, and may take the form of a tax for the privilege of exercising its franchises within the state, if the ascertainment of the amount is made dependent in fact on the value of its property situated within the state (the exaction, therefore, not being susceptible of exceeding the sum whic might be leviable directly thereon), and if payment be not made a condition precedent to the right \n\n[247 U.S. 321, 327]\n\u00a0\n to carry on the business, but its enforcement left to the ordinary means devised for the collection of taxes.'\n\n Again, in Atlantic, etc., Tel. Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 \nU.S. 160, 163\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 817, the court upon a review of numerous previous cases laid down certain propositions as established, among them these: (a) That the immunity of an individual or corporation engaged in interstate commerce from state regulation does not prevent a state from imposing ordinary property taxes upon property having a situs within its territory and employed in interstate commerce; and (b) that the franchise of a corporation, although that franchise be the business of interstate commerce, is, as a part of its property, subject to state taxation, provided at least the franchise be not derived from the United States See, also, St. Louis S. W. Railway v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 365\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99.\n Yet it is obvious that taxes imposed upon property or franchises employed in interstate commerce must be paid from the net returns of such commerce, and diminish them in the same sense that they are diminished by a tax imposed upon the net returns themselves.\n The distinction between direct and indirect burdens, with particular reference to a comparison between a tax upon the gross returns of carriers in interstate commerce and a general income tax imposed upon all inhabitants incidentally affecting carriers engaged in such commerce, was the subject of consideration in Phila. Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326, 345\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 1118, 1124 (30 L. Ed. 1200) where the court, by Mr. Justice Bradley, said:\n'The corporate franchises, the property, the business, the income of corporations created by a state may undoubtedly be taxed by the state; but in imposing such taxes care should be taken not to interfere with or hamper, directly or by indirection, interstate or foreign commerce, or any other matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of \n\n[247 U.S. 321, 328]\n\u00a0\n the federal government.'\n\n Many previous cases were referred to.\n The correct line of distinction is so well illustrated in two cases decided at the present term that we hardly need go further. In Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 U.S. 292\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 126, 62 L. Ed. --, we held that a state tax upon the business of selling goods in foreign commerce, measured by a certain percentage of the gross transactions in such commerce, was by its necessary effect a tax upon the commerce, and at the same time a duty upon exports, contrary to sections 8 and 10 of article 1 of the Constitution, since it operated to lay a direct burden upon every transaction by withholding for the use of the state a part of every dollar received. On the other hand, in Peck & Co. v. Lowe, Collector, 38 Sup. Ct. 432, \n247 U.S. 165\n, 62 L. Ed. --, decided May 20th last, we held that the Income Tax Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16,  2, 38 Stat. 166, 172, when carried into effect by imposing an assessment upon the entire net income of a corporation, approximately threefourths of which was derived from the export of goods to foreign countries, did not amount to laying a tax or duty on articles exported within the meaning of article 1,  9, cl. 5, of the Constitution. The distinction between a direct and an indirect burden by way of tax or duty was developed, and it was shown that an income tax laid generally on net incomes, not on income from exportation because of its source or in the way of discrimination, but just as it was laid on other income, and affecting only the net receipts from exportation after all expenses were paid and losses adjusted and the recipient of the income was free to use it as he chose, was only an indirect burden.\n The difference in effect between a tax measured by gross receipts and one measured by net income, recognized by our decisions, is manifest and substantial, and it affords a convenient and wo kable basis of distinction between a direct and immediate burden upon the business affected and a charge that is only indirect and inci- \n\n[247 U.S. 321, 329]\n\u00a0\n dental. A tax upon gross receipts affects each transaction in proportion to its magnitude and irrespective of whether it is profitable or otherwise. Conceivably it may be sufficient to make the difference between profit and loss, or to so diminish the profit as to impede or discourage the conduct of the commerce. A tax upon the net profits has not the same deterrent effect, since it does not arise at all unless a gain is shown over and above expenses and losses, and the tax cannot be heavy unless the profits are large. Such a tax, when imposed upon net incomes from whatever source arising, is but a method of distributing the cost of government, like a tax upon property, or upon franchises treated as property; and if there be no discrimination against interstate commerce, either in the admeasurement of the tax or in the means adopted for enforcing it, it constitutes one of the ordinary and general burdens of government, from which persons and corporations otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the states are not exempted by the federal Constitution because they happen to be engaged in commerce among the states.\n And so we hold that the Wisconsin income tax law, as applied to the plaintiff in the case before us, cannot be deemed to be so direct a burden upon plaintiff's interstate business as to amount to an unconstitutional interference with or regulation of commerce among the states. It was measured not by the gross receipts, but by the net proceeds from this part of plaintiff's business, along with a like imposition upon its income derived from other sources, and in the same way that other corporations doing business within the state are taxed upon that proportion of their income derived from business transacted and property located within the state, whatever the nature of their business.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","177":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU. S. v. UNITED SHOE MACHINERY CO. OF NEW JERSEY(1918)\nNo. 207\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n - \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 33]\n\u00a0\n Suit to dissolve an asserted combination and conspiracy between certain companies, makers or dealers in boot and \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n shoe machinery, and the officers of the companies; also to have declared illegal and canceled certain leases and agreements, charged to be the means of the combination and conspiracy whereby, through control over the manufacturers of boots and shoes, competition has been prevented, inventive genius subjected to the designs of the combiners and conspirators, and auxiliary machines and accessories controlled and made subsidiary.\n The charges are met with denials, with justification that the conduct which is asserted to be illegal was in promotion of trade, in natural development of business and in strict compliance with modern trade progress; indeed, that there was simply the fusion of independent and noncompeting businesses, each differing from the other, and the combination of various elements of machinery covered by United States patents and all of it relating to the same art and the same school of manufactures. And that the leases and agreements were but the exercise of patent rights, wholly legal and indeed necessary.\n These contentions are displayed in a bill which occupies 46 pages of the record and an answer of equal volume.\n The statute of limitations is also pleaded in defense, the greater part of the acts charged being alleged to have taken place more than six years before the filing of the petition.\n Three judges sat in the case, who heard the testimony in open court. Upon its completion and consideration a decree was entered dismissing the bill. Each judge rendered an opinion exhibiting the case from a different angle, and the opinions, taken together, display all the phases of the case and the considerations and issues involved, (D. C.) 222 Fed. 349.\n Mr. H. La Rue Brown, of Boston, Mass., for the United States.\n Messrs. Charles F. Choate, Jr., and Frederick P. Fish, both of Boston, Mass., for appellees. \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 35]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The charge of the bill is that defendants, not being satisfied with the monopoly of their patents and determined to extend it, conceived the idea of acquiring the ownership or control of all concerns engaged in the manufacture of all kinds of shoe machinery. This purpose was achieved, it is charged, and a monopoly acquired, and commerce, interstate and foreign, restrained by the union of competing companies and the acquisition of others. And that leases were exacted which completed and assured the control and monopoly thus acquired.\n But this charge of comprehensive trade dominance was modified in the course of the trial. The government disclaimed the assertion of such extensive culpability and confined its contention to machinery adapted to the bottoming of shoes (attaching soles to uppers), machines called clicking machines (cutting-out machines), and eyeletting machines ( sufficiently indicated by name), and \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 36]\n\u00a0\n declared that if the bill did not so limit the actual monopoly counsel would agree so to limit it.\n Of course, we agree with the government that defendants cannot be discharged from all guilt merely because they leave open some branches of the business to the enterprise prise of others, or, as the government puts it, 'that a limited field is as yet open to competition.' But in view of the large design attributed to the defendants and the illustration of what it is contended they accomplished, it would be interesting if not instructive to be told when their l rge scheme was abandoned or broke down, even though it may now be said to be an unimportant detail, since the trial court has decided that neither the greater nor lesser scheme was established by the evidence.\n The condlusion, however, is contested, and in description of what is now contended, the government says that 'the end which avowedly was sought by the organizers of the United Company was 'the control in one corporation, both in the United States and in foreign countries, of the efficient types of shoe machinery.\" And, further, after stating the business of defendants to be that 'of supplying machines used in the manufacture of shoes,' and the restraint of interstate and foreign commerce in certain of the machines, it is said:\n'The subject matter of the action, therefore, is the effect of the things done by the defendants upon the trade between manufacturers of machines used in the manufacture of shoes and the manufacturers of shoes.'\n\n And in further display of the interest which attaches to the issues, it is said:\n'Shoes are made in every part of the Union' and 'it is obvious that supplying important machines for such an industry must be an exceedingly important part of the interstate trade and commerce of the United States.'\n\n And there are contentions as to the dominance achieved. Indeed, it is asserted somewhat fervidly that the United Company 'is absolute monarch of the industry' and \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 37]\n\u00a0\n that 'no competitor can exist unless for its own pleasure or policy it withholds its destroying hand.'\n There are opposing contentions no less fervidly urged. There is denial of the purpose attributed to the defendants or the possession or exercise of baleful power, and the insistence that the United Company is a union of noncompeting businesses conducted under letters patent, effecting through the resources thus acquired greater economies in manufacture and greater efficiency of machinery and 'in other ways perfecting the shoemaker's art'-advantages not engrossed by the company but inuring to its patrons and through them to the wearers of their product, a finished shoe.\n In final answer to the charge of the government the comprehensive declaration is that the shoe machinery industry is not one open to everybody on equal terms. It is one of patents. And the company's power, if it have power, is not that of combination but the power of the superiority of its inventions-the effect and demonstrated supremacy of its mechanical instrumentalities.\n The contentions could not well be more antagonistic, upon each of which there was conflicting testimony, and the important fact is to be borne in mind that it was given in open court(except as to certain contentions about patents, their scope and validity).1 The fact justifies deference \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 38]\n\u00a0\n to the findings of the trial court. Adamson v. Gilliland, \n242 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 169.\n There are two accusations against the defendants. One is that at the very outset they com ined competing companies and subsequently acquired others, section 1 of the act of 1890 (Act July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 [Comp. St. 1916,  8820])2 being thereby offended. The other is a monopolization of the trade in violation of section 2 of that act (Comp. St. 1916,  8821). And it is charged, as we have said, that certain leases and license agreements are the instruments which consummate both offenses.\n The offense of combination was committed, it is contended, February 7, 1899, at which time seven shoe machinery companies were consolidated into the United Shoe Machinery Company of New Jersey, a corporation organized for that purpose. The companies were: The Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company, the International Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company, Consolidated & McKay Lasting Machine Company, McKay Shoe Machinery Company, Davey Pegging Machine Company, Eppler Welt Machine \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 39]\n\u00a0\n Company and the International Eppler Welt Machine Company. The last two companies were acquired by the new company after its formation, but they may be regarded as constituent companies. The businesses of these companies were conveyed to the new company, the businesses being those of manufacturing, selling and leasing and dealing in shoe machinery, including patents of the United States and other countries. \n3\n A more \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 40]\n\u00a0\n particular distinction we do not deem it necessary to make.\n The first question is, Were the companies in competition? It confronts us at the outset; all other considerations are dependent upon it. As an element in the answer to it we must revert to the admission that the charge of combination is only as to machinery for bottoming shoes-that is, the uniting of the sole to the upper-an operation which might be called 'simple' if the complexity of this record did not contradict it and if we were not told that the letters patent covering the machinery for the operation are too great in number for explanation or enumeration. It is said that on certain classes of shoes over 100 different operations are performed by different machines. And the government has taken pains to tell us how far 'the mysteries of the shoemaker's art and the variations between different methods of making shoes' are outside of the understanding of the purchaser of them. To him, it is said, 'shoes are shoes, except as they differ in appearance, comfort, wearing qualities, and price.' But to the manufacturer distinctions multiply and to the production of a shoe a complete line of machinery is necessary. Indeed, the government makes the mystery of the art and the necessity of the instrumentalities, in part, the basis of its argument. \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 41]\n\u00a0\n We are therefore admonished at once of the complexity of the case and the maze of mechanical technicalities into which we should be plunged in estimating the evidence if we had not the guidance of the opinions of the judges of the trial court. The court found, as we have said, that the companies were not in competition at the time of their union in the United Company, and based the finding not only upon the testimony of witnesses but the uses of the machines of the respective companies and their methods of operation. The testimony was conflicting, it is true, and different judgments might be formed upon it, but from an examination of the record we cannot pronounce that of the trial court to be wrong. Indeed, it seems to us to be supported by the better reason. We should risk misunderstanding and error if we should attempt to pick out that which makes against it and disregard that which makes for it and judge of witnesses from their reported words as against their living presence, the advantage which the trial court had.\n The government, however, urges two circumstances which it contends corroborate its oral testimony and against which it asserts that 'literal denials of specific intent to restrain trade are of no significance.' But there was more than literal denials. There were detailed representation of the condition of the trade and explanation of the machines convincing, as we have seen, in its strength and the confirmation it received. Let us, however, consider the instances upon which the government relies. The most important of them is a circular letter4 sent by \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 42]\n\u00a0\n the directors of the Goodyear Company to its stockholders which set forth that great advantages were to be secured by the control in one corporation of the most efficient types of shoe machinery and that the directors and large stockholders had been in negotiation to accom lish that end; and further that the United Company would from time to time acquire other shoe machinery properties either by direct ownership or by purchase of shares of their stock. Also a like declaration5 in a contract with its agent in Australia. \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 43]\n\u00a0\n The circular and agreement could not, of themselves, give character to the constituent companies. It is evident, therefore, that both of them need comment to give them sinister signiflcance, and the innuendo of the government is that they meant not only that great competing companies had been united, but that other companies-competitors, it may be-would be acquired. It would be a stout credulity that could accept this explanation against the counter considerations. We cannot put out of mind that according to the government, in repeated assertions, the United Company in 1899, twelve years before the suit was brought, jumped into the field full- panoplied in monopolistic power and started immediately on its career of dominance and restraint of trade. But to preclude the denial of the assertions it is now said that, in stock circulars and trade agreements, the company trumpeted its might and illegal enterprise to two continents, Deliberate guilt-we say deliberate guilt, for it is not a question of ignorance or imbecility-is usually not so bold. It masks its purpose to hide it from prevention and penalty. If it may be asserted that the trade agreement was in secret, certainly the circular letter to the stockholders committed the scheme to publicity.\n We cannot, therefore, accept the explanation of the government. Its implications discredit it. It implies that there was governmental supineness for a long time or an extraordinary oversight of conspicuous, indeed vaunted, criminality. Neither can be accepted. And we are persuaded that the circular and agreement were not intended nor regarded to be the avowal, as contended by the government, of monopoly, achieved or to be achieved, but simply the business expression and foresight of the advantages which would res lt from the concentration in one management of instrumentalities which, however different, supplement one another in the creation of a shoe.\n We have given the explanation of the government importance \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 44]\n\u00a0\n because the government has done so. And we have only answered in estimation of what the circular and agreement are worth as avowals of intention. Of course, if the government is right, they are unimportant circumstances; the demonstration of the United Company's purpose is complete without them; for the government contends that the constituent companies were in open competition and that their union resulted in the 'immediate suppression of the actual and potential competition' in shoe machinery and the 'creation of an organization of vast resources ... which gave it a power to extend and intrench its monopoly which none of its constituent companies, however successful, could approach.' If this were a fact it would not need the confirmation of words.\n The second circumstance cited by the government is that before the union of the companies their machines had a flexibility in use that the testimony of defendants does not now ascribe to them, and that this was declared in advertisements. We are not disposed to give much importance to the circumstance. It may be that there was a certain interchangeability in the described machines, but, in the opinion of the trial court, there was, notwithstanding, no practical competition between them. We can add nothing to what determined its judgment or to the detailed comparison and explanation of the machines made in its opinions. Indeed, we might rest this branch of the case on those opinions. They were considerate of all the elements of the government's contentions and the opposing contentions and tested the machines, their sameness and difference and respective efficiency, by the purposes for which they were designed by the inventors and employed in the trade and by the explanations made of them.\n In considering the competition of the machines and in estimating the defendants' acts in uniting the companies, \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 45]\n\u00a0\n it is to be observed that the machines were all made 'under letters patent of the United States and other countries,' were owned by the companies, and covered improvements made by the companies from time to time and embodied in the machines, which were so far developed that they were in 1899 principally in use by shoe manufacturers in the kinds of work to which they were respectively adapted. The patents and the business passed to the new company, but necessarily were the same in its hand as before. In other words, the patents did not lose their distinction, nor the machines their difference; and to dwell upon the percentages of manufacture is misleading. Of a like situation we said in United States v. Winslow, \n227 \nU.S. 202, 217\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 253, 255 (57 L. Ed. 481), and said of it in answer to the charge against the combination here involved, that we could.\n'See no greater objection to one corporation manufacturing seventy per cent. of three noncompeting groups of patented machines collectively used for making a single product than to three corporations making the same proportion of one group each. The disintegration aimed at by the statute [act of 1890] does not extend to reducing all manufacture to isolated units of the lowest degree.'\n\n Or, as expressed by one of the judges in the court below:\n'The combination was not unlawful so far as it did no more than put the different groups of noncompeting machines into one control. ... It was not unlawful unless, to an extent injurious to the public interest, it destroyed competition.'\n\n And it was held that competition was not destroyed to the designated extent. Indeed, the court was repelled, as it might well have been, by the consequences of so holding on account of the change of conditions, the union of the companies not having been questioned by the government for twelve years and large investments having been made not only by the company but by the public.\n The l pse of time, indeed, may not condone the offense \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 46]\n\u00a0\n if offense there was. It, however, may call offense in question and be an element in the refutation of accusations long deferred, or determine against particular remedies. It is to be remembered that a dissolution of the offending companies is prayed and that each of them be 'separated into such parts that no one of them will constitute a monopoly of the shoe machinery business,' or that receivers be appointed to take possession of them and their assets, business and affairs and wind them up and 'bring about conditions in trade and commerce among the states and with foreign countries in harmony with law.' If there be need for this the difficulties of achievement should not deter; but the difficulties may admonish against the need and demonstrate that the situation may be remediless or to be redressed at a cost too great. Therefore, considering the remedy prayed, which is extreme, even in its mildest demands, we may ask, what of the investments that have been made during these years of extension and development of the new company's business? What of the machines that have become obsolete and the new ones that have been developed? What of the patents that have expired and the new ones that have not yet run out, and how distribute them? And what of their effect when distributed? Will their monopoly cease, or be regarded as an instrument of illegal purpose and forfeited as a deodand? How pick out from the new conditions the conditions of 1899 and restore them and the art of that time and rehabilitate the businesses that are alleged to have ceased to exist or to have become merged in the United Company? How from the complexity only thus suggested, not displayed, 'bring about conditions in trade and commerce' in shoe machinery 'among the states and with foreign countries in harmony with law,' which is the ultimate resource of the government for this part of the case? How radical should the disintegration be? Or should there be a sale in en- \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 47]\n\u00a0\n tirety and not in parts? And, if in entirety, will the purchaser get an immunity that the companies did not have? A sale in entirety would seem to be absolutely necessary to preserve the works at Beverly. And yet how can that be done if there be a dissolution of the company and a distribution of machines? On the other hand, the idea is repellent that so complete an instrumentality should be dismantled and its concentration and efficiency lost. It has been testified that the purpose of the organization was the consolidating of all the machines in one modern factory and the standardizing of them. This purpose has been attained. The company employs there 4,000 men.\n There are, however, certain instances of acquisition which may be said to give confirmation to the charges of the government and justify the demand for redress, at whatever cost or disaster to the offenders; in other words, demonstrate the purpose of the original union of the companies, the persistence of that purpose and the extension of its dominion having the evil consequences depicted by the government. Upon these instances it would seem unnecessary to dwell, the companies not being competitive at the time of their union in the United Company. However, they are made so much of by the government and are so strongly urged that attention must be given to them. The most important of them and the one that was given most prominence in the testimony was that of the plant and machinery of the Thomas G. Plant Company, a New Jersey corporation, a manufacturer of shoes, not of machinery, and of the shoe machinery interest of Thomas G. Plant.\n Plant was an inventor of machines of the shoe-bottoming variety and had taken out a number of letters patent in the United States and foreign countries covering the same. There was in the testimony and is in the argument of counsel dispute as to the efficiency of the machines of themselves. We say 'of themselves' to distinguish \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 48]\n\u00a0\n them from the inventions embodied in them, a necessary distinction to meet some of the phases of the case. A set was installed in the Plant Company's factory, of which Plant owned a majority of the stock. Two other concerns to which they were offered under inducements refused to accept them. It may be admitted, as the trial court found, that they had experimental promise, and it was testified that a number of shoe manufacturers had concerted to buy them. There were charges of infringements of the United Company's machines and Plant was loath to permit an inspection; indeed for a time refused it. And, besides, for their completion into a set for combined operation important machines were necessary which were not yet developed. As they stood they were undoubtedly inferior to the machines of the United Company, and in the state, therefore, in which the United Company took them they were not found capable of use. Nothing was in them which affords reasonable support for the government's contention that they were 'right at the threshold of extensive competition with the United Company.' But, suppose they were. It would only be conjecture to say that they would cross it or that their strength would be formidable if they did. It is in the testimony that they broke down upon trial and were supplanted in the Plant factory where Plant had installed them by the United Company's machines. And the substitution was not at the dictation of the latter company. The vice president of the Plant Company and the general manager of its factory \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 49]\n\u00a0\n testified that satisfactory work could not be done with them on men's shoes; they broke down even in the manufacture of women's shoes to which they were adapted.\n It appeared that some of the machines infringed the United Company's and in some details the latter infringed the Plant machines, and the complexity of rights hence resulting, to which we shall presently refer, had led to and threatened litigation; to compose which, it was testified, and the trial court found, was a contributory inducement of the United Company's purchase from Plant.\n The government resists the finding. Its conception is, and to this all of its contentions are addressed, that the United Company combined and was intended to combine great competing companies and to acquire other competing companies. 'The United Company acquired,' counsel say, 'every company then [when the company was organized] actively putting out or planning to put out' machinery adapted to bottoming shoes, and that 'in the twelve years before the bringing of this action no substantial change took place, but rather the monopoly so acquired was in some respects extended and in many respects strengthened and intrenched.' In the light of this conception and contention the government sees and colors all that the United Company has done, all of the acquisitions it has made, and upon whatever motive made, including the prevention of patent troubles or the composition of litigation. And it directly says of the purchase from Plant that it was made at an overvaluation and by it Plant was tempted to the bargain and the United Company satisfied by getting rid of a competitor.\n We get no solution of the purpose of the parties by the price the United Company paid. \n6\n We must consider what it was paid for. It is to be remembered that we are dealing with a transaction which took place eleven years after the formation of that company and is to be judged of by its own circumstances, the incentives of that time. Plant was eager to sell and the overtures came from him-indeed, he engaged two intermediaries, to one of whom he paid a large commission. There was necessarily negotiation before the final meeting of minds. To estimate the bargain to it the United Company insisted upon an \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 50]\n\u00a0\n inspection of the machines, that is, to estimate their value, as it was testified, 'to the advancing of the art of shoe making.' \n7\n Plant refused at first, as we have said, but later yielded, and after inspection the purchase was consummated. Indeed, there were two inspections. The report on the first was adverse to the purchase. Mr. Winslow, president of the United Company, took part in the second and we may quote his testimony, for it is the standpoint of that company we are now considering. His testimony, besides, had confirmation. He believed, he testified, that he had a broader knowledge of shoe machinery than any one else and he therefore studied the Plant machines 'personally as an expert.' He considered them, he said, from the standpoint of their capacity, the value of the inventions and the improvements embodied in them, the comparison of their work with the work of the United Company's machines and the mechanical construction of the latter. He further testified that:\n'Plant had used the Goodyear machines [the United Company's machines] as a basis for his machines and made important improvements and developments.'\n\n He indicated one of the improvements in particular, which he regarded as of the very greatest practical importance, especially when combined \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 51]\n\u00a0\n with a device that the United Company had just developed and placed in its factories. In a 'broad way,' he said, the value was almost incalculable.\n But there was an interdependency of values. While the Plant device had value over that of the United Company's, it was controlled by the latter, or, as the witness expressed the situation, 'in a broad way it was a perfect deadlock.' In other words, the United Company had the underlying invention and Plant a patent for a particular form of operation which was necessarily subordinate to the other-a situation familiar in patent law and contests.\n It will be seen, therefore, that there was no other way out of the deadlock, if the inventions were to be used together-that is, embodied in one machine, without infringement-than by ownership in one hand of all the patents. That plan was adopted and was the inducement of the purchase of the Plant inventions by the United Company. But there was litigation to be composed as well, and was composed.\n Another witness testified as to the relation of the Plant patents and those of the United Company and stated that the result, if Plant had insisted upon his patent rights and the company had insisted upon its patent rights, would have been 'a stop in the development of shoe machinery in these lines,' and continuing, he said:\n'We should hardly have dared to go ahead with the improvements in our machines for fear of not succeeding in our patent litigation, or of conflicting with such improvements as Plant had patented. On the other hand, Plant, or any company which he might form, would have hardly dared to go ahead with the possibility of these infringement suits. These infringement suits, or a good many of them, were then pending, and certainly he would have found very few customers, I think, for his machines.'\n\n This, in outline, was the situation that confronted the \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 52]\n\u00a0\n parties and induced their transaction, the incentives of each being as indicated. And they were justifiable incentives, and we may accept them as an alternative to the contention made by the government t at a violation of law was the impelling motive of the parties. And we may say that after the United Company had made the Plant acquisition it proceeded to make improvements on the Plant patents and developed many of them, giving them an efficiency they did not have before.\n There are other acquisitions that are emphasized, among them, that of the stock of the Goddu Sons Metal Company. It was acquired March, 1899, a month after the United Company was formed and eleven years befors this suit was brought; and the inducement to the acquisition was to settle the patent troubles that came to the United Company through one of its constituent companies. The value obtained was in patents. These were for the metallic variety of machines, and, according to a witness for defendants, 'at that time the United Company was putting out commercial machines for doing the work for which the Goddu machines were intended.' And, according to another witness, though not then in a condition to be placed in the hands of manufacturers, 'they were in a state of development where some of them could have been, without extensive changes, made operative.'\n By this testimony the defendants justify the purchase; the government condemns it. The defendants say that it was in composition of an inherited litigation and that patents of value were obtained by it. To this the government replies in condemnation that the cost of the settlement of the disputes was excessive, being $150,000, and the purpose of getting the patents was to forestall the competition they threatened and could have accomplished by their development.\n The value of a settlement of a dispute about rights which has reached litigation or threatens it cannot be \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 53]\n\u00a0\n easily or accurately estimated. It depends upon too many considerations which are not reflected in the price paid. The other ground of condemnation has strength. As the government says, quoting Circuit Judge Putnam in another case, neither the letter of the law nor its purpose 'distinguishes between strangling of commerce which has been born and preventing the birth of a commerce which does not exist.' But there is another view. No one can tell the strength of the competition that may be in a patent. It may be more than competition; it may be destruction, and the Anti-Trust Act surely does not require the acceptance of that or forbid effort to prevent it. But even if such extreme does not impend, certainly improvement of business and its efficiency can be striven for without offense to the law. United States v. Winslow, supra.\n We may say here of the contention of the government as to the acquisitions-and the same comment may be made of most of its contentions- that they cast us into speculation for their estimate and urge us to decide between well-sustained conflicting opinions and adjudge the defendants guilty of a violation of law. And this, too, against the considered judgment of the trial court.\n We see no illegality in the contract with Goddu for assignment of other inventions he might make, or in like agreement with others. We content ourselves with this general declaration. An analysis of the contracts is not feasible, nor are the covenants measurable. That they are attempts to subject the inventive genius of the country to the designs of the defendants is too extreme. They can be seen to have more particular use and to be justified in the circumstances of the transaction with which they were connected. Those whom one employs one gives opportunity to (this was Goddu's case) and may exact that it be used for the employer. Those who have conveyed to him special machines may be presumed to have been compensated by their price, and that in either case \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 54]\n\u00a0\n there will be such development and use as to make them competitive is too speculative to justify a judgment.\n It is to be noted that the acquisitions in this case were not coincident in time nor parts of the same transaction. They were scattered through a period of years and varied each from the other, had no dependency, were different an unrelated steps in the development of the business of defendants. They must hence be judged separately, not in accumulation.\n The above comment is applicable to other acquisitions, said to be fifty-six in number. It is impossible to review them. A description of them and wherein the machines acquired were competitive with the machines of the United Company the government sets forth in many pages of its brief, and the defendants reply as circumstantially with opposing delineation and justification. Their effect is hard to estimate. The removal in some degree of competition may be charged against some of them and yet, on the other hand, the acquisitions may be said to be justified by the exigencies or conveniences of the situation. Some of them were merely of accessorial machines; some in composition of patent troubles; some not connected with the special charge of monopoly to which the government has limited itself; some the transfer to defendants of kinds of machines not possessed by them; some of patented improvements and inventions, aiding or completing the defendants' machines, tributary therefore to their efficiency. They give a false impression by their number. They added nothing of obnoxious power to the United Company nor in any practical or large sense removed competition.\n Defendants charge that the government not only puts an exaggerated computation upon the acquisitions by defendants but gives no credit for or account to their resistance of applications to buy other and, it is asserted, more important concerns. Their number is given as seventy-five, all of great use and importance. The trial court found that the \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 55]\n\u00a0\n offers refused were more numerous and several of them were of concerns more important to the scheme of monopoly charged against defendants than any of the specified acquisitions. The comment is justified by one evidence.\n We pass by the charge of the government that the United Company through its president threatened destruction to opponents and the use of his influence in the business world to enforce transfers of competing concerns and the patents they controlled. The charge and its denial or explanation were estimated by the trial judges and the charge was held not to be established, or of no serious importance. The court said that if the declarations could be called 'threats' in view of all the surrounding circumstances shown, it was not established that any competitor lost a customer or that anybody was prevented from attempting competition. Besides, they were isolated instances, separated in time, without relation, not co-ordinated acts in a scheme of oppression.\n We cannot go into further detail without unduly extending this opinion. It would be repetition, besides, of what was done carefully and thoroughly in the opinions of the trial judges. We sum up with a generalization that the United Company took by its organization 'established businesses already of great value, possessing great possibilities of development,' as said by the trial court. It was discerned that there was advantage in their concentration, and the expansion that has hence resulted has been as much in necessary evolution as by design. At its foundation there were certain basic patents and many auxiliary ones. Inventors-those connected with and those independent of it- were devising and experimenting, and of this the company had to keep informed. It had to keep up with the mechanical march; to fall back would have been its destruction. There was growth not only in its business proper but in the accessories to it. When it was formed in 1899 it had no facilities for furnishing findings \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 56]\n\u00a0\n and supplies. It was business enterprise or, it may be, necessity, to acquire them, and their acquisition became what is called in the case the United Company's 'general department,' which handles, it is said, between 150 and 200 different kinds of machines. The expansion to this and in this was like the expansion of the department store-an accumulation not only of necessary things, but of incidental, supp emental things, auxiliary to the completion and finish of a boot or shoe. There is a service force as well, estimated at 6,000 men, to repair immediately breaks or deterioration without extra charge. And these men are kept at convenient places to repair machines and replace worn-out parts, and depots of supplies are maintained. There are also instructors of operators as well as furnishing of men in emergency. It is in the testimony that a total of 8,889 operatives were taught in the year 1911 alone.\n The company, indeed, has magnitude, but it is at once the result and cause of efficiency, and the charge that it has been oppressively used is not sustained. Patrons are given the benefits of the improvements made by the company and new machines are substituted for the old ones without disproportionate charge. There has been saving as well in the cost of manufacture of shoes. These are some of the results of the organization of the United Company. Others are testified to and the means of their accomplishment; but time will not permit their statement, and we pass to the leases.\n There was complaint of them and the government attacks them. Complaints, however, may be interested lament; but, on the other hand, they may be the expression of real grievance and demand redress. And which they are should be considered. To the attacks of the government the defendants reply that the leases are the exercise of their right as patentees and if there is monopoly in them it is the monopoly of the right. It \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 57]\n\u00a0\n must, indeed, be said that it is the experience of the world that the utility of an invention entices to its infringement, but it would be a perversion of things to facilitate the wrong by a sacrifice of the right in revulsion from the restraint which the right authorizes. But, on the other hand, we must not overestimate the right or give it a sinister effect-permit it to be a means, to use the words of the government, 'to the building up and intrenchment' of an 'illegal monopoly.' We cannot consider the contentions with the detail that counsel have. We think that their answer is in the statement of certain general propositions.\n Of course, there is restraint in a patent. Its strength is in the restraint, the right to exclude others from the use of the invention, absolutely or on the terms the patentee chooses to impose. This strength is the compensation which the law grants for the exercise of invention. Its exertion within the field covered by the patent law is not an offense against the Anti-Trust Act. In other circumstances it may be, as in Standard Sanitary Co. v. United States, \n226 U.S. 20\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 9, to which case that at bar has no resemblance.\n The question, then, is, Was the patent right lawfully exerted in the leases? Were they anything more than the exercise of the patent monopoly? The word is descriptive and must be used, but it does not imply oppression. The old instrumentalities exist for all who are content with them and who care not for the better ones which inventive genius creates.\n The charge of oppression puts out of view many essential things. We must keep in mind the quality of the right we are considering and that the inventor gets nothing from the law that he did not have before and that the only effect of his patent is to restrain others from dealing with or using its device. United States v. Bell Tel. Co., \n167 \nU.S. 224, 229\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 809; Paper Bag Patent Case, \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 58]\n\u00a0\n \n210 \nU.S. 405, 424\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 748; Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., \n243 \nU.S. 502, 510\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 416, L. R. A. 1917E, 1187, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 9599 Or to put it another way, the inventor does not get from the law a right to a use that he did not have before but he gets the right to an exclusive use. Take this from him and you take all that the law gives him and to secure which the public faith is pledged. Chief Justice Marshall in Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218, 242.\n Indeed, we said in the Paper Bag Patent Case that he may keep his invention out of use. Therefore, he necessarily has the power of granting it to some and withholding it from others, a right of selection of persons and terms. There is, however, a limitation upon him; he cannot grant the title and retain the incidents of it. Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n243 U.S. 490\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 412, L. R. A. 1917E, 1196, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 955; Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell, \n229 U.S. 1\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 616, 50 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1185, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 150; Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., supra.\n These cases have received review and application in Boston Store of Chicago v. American Graphophone Company and Columbia Graphophone Company, \n246 U.S. 8\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 257, 62 L. Ed. --, decided March 4, 1918. The principle of them was expressed to be that where an article has been sold it passes beyond the monopoly given by the patent and conditions cannot be imposed upon it. Leases are not of this character; they do not convey the title. It is not contended, nor could it be, that in this case they are a disguise for something else, artifices to convey the machinery and yet keep it subject to the patent right and its exercise. It, therefore, follows that conditions may be imposed by them.\n It is not certain that the government denies this or means to assert anything more than that the patent right is exercised in oppression, assisting, indeed consummating, a scheme of monopoly, begun by the formation of the United Company, prosecuted in the various ways to which we have referred, and completed by the leases and their clauses.\n It is difficult to represent the contentions of the government \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 59]\n\u00a0\n without under-coloring them or over-coloring them. There is one that the leases are invalid in and of themselves; there is another that 'ultimately, of course, it is upon the lease forms themselves and their apparent and necessary effect upon competition that the United States relies.' The first contention the government leaves very much to assertion, and defendants charge that it was not made in the trial court; the second contention is necessary to assign to the leases an obnoxious quality in the hands of the United Company which they did not have in the hands of the constituent companies. The distinction would seem to be not material of itself, and the important consideration is not what the leases were in some other relation but what they are in their present relation and to what purpose are they being rightfully or wrongfully, or can they be rightfully or wrongfully, used or enforced? To this inquiry we shall now address ourselves.\n The first objection made to the leases is that they are unchangeable by the lessee-he 'has no right,' it is urged, to demand either the cancellation or modification of an existing one. The objection is not definite or measurable. It is probably but a representation of what is deemed the severity of the leases, for, of course, a contract is a restraint upon option and can be enforced. This power is its efficacy and indicates its obligation. And further it is of no consequence that the leases cover all of the machines of the United Company if they are an exercise of the patent rights. Whether they are is the broad question in the case and its disposition will dispose of all minor and dependent ones.\n What, then, do the leases accomplish? They have clauses called 'tying' clauses, so called because, it is said, they tie the use of the machine leased to the use of machines not covered by the particular lease. Their result is, the government asserts, 'to make it in effect a \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 60]\n\u00a0\n condition of the lease that the lessee shall not use the machines of competitors to supply a need for additional machines of the kind leased or for machines of other important though wholly different types.'\n And it is urged:\n'In addition to those clauses there are certain other clauses which have a similar effect upon the freedom of the lessees' choice of machines. They give to the tying clauses their maxim m effect as destroyers of the possibility of competition with the defendants.'\n\n It is charged that 'the objectionable clauses are inter-related and operate together with cumulative effect'; that 'they are unlawful both as integral and effective parts of an unlawful whole and, for the most part, in and of themselves.' And it is further charged that 'it is, however, in their combined effect as a system of leasing, used and insisted upon by a corporation dominant in its field, that the full extent of their illegality is to be perceived.' This, however, is assertion and relies for its foundation upon the assumption of an illegal dominance by the United Company that has been found not to exist. This element, therefore, must be put to one side and the leases regarded in and of themselves and by the incentives that induced their execution; and to a suit seeking their dissolution it may well be contended that the lessees are necessary parties, certainly so far as existing leases are concerned. But the contention of the government goes farther and asserts that its purpose and object justify the absence of the lessees from the case. Indeed, the government takes merit to itself in relieving them of a thraldom. The rights of the lessees.' it is said, 'are not touched except to preserve them.' But a lessee may like his situation, may have deliberately chosen it and may not care for any interposition, benevolent or otherwise.\n Finally the government, in possible opposition to both lessor and lessee, asserts that 'no one has the right to \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 61]\n\u00a0\n say that the unlawful conduct of another shall be permitted to continue because he has an interest in it.' Perhaps not. But there may be dispute as to the character of the conduct, and its illegality cannot be conceded to mere assertion and the consequent assumption of a destroying power.\n However, let us consider the clauses from the standpoint of the government's contentions and determine if they transcend the rights given to patentees. The clauses are: (1) One that prescribes a uniform term of 17 years. The result of this is, the government says, 'that during that long period no replacement of a machine so leased by a better machine of defendants or others, no change in the form of the lease or avoidance of any of its requirements, is open to the lessee except with the defendants' consent and upon their terms.' To this it is replied that the leases of the constituent companies ran for indefinite periods and, besides, new patents were constantly taken out, and to these the criticism of the government does not apply. And again, the term was assurance to the lessee as well as lessor, and, as defendants' counsel suggest, there is analogy in the term to that of a building lease which may under the hazard of circumstances turn out to be or not to be advantageous. Of this there are two recent examples in this court. Wm. Filene's Sons Co. v. Weed et al., \n245 U.S. 597\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 211, 62 L. Ed. --, and Gardner, Trustee, etc., v. Wm. S. Butler & Co., Inc., \n245 U.S. 603\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 214, 62 L. Ed. --, decided February 4, 1918. Indeed, we may say of all the clauses, without a minute analysis and discussion of them, that they were simply bargains, based on patent rights and the conditions upon which those rights were granted. (2) The 'additional machines' clause, which provides that in case the lessee has more work than can be performed by the machine leased, he will lease additional machinery to perform the work, and that if the lessee does not do so the lessor may cancel the lease if he so elect, and any other lease of machinery of the same kind then in \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 62]\n\u00a0\n force between them. This clause, we shall presently see, was discontinued in 1907 and was not in use when this suit was brought. (3) An 'exclusive use' clause requiring the lessee of particular machinery to use it exclusively and the auxiliary machines which aid or supplement it, and for failure to do so, lessor may at his option terminate forthwith in writing any or all leases or licenses of the particular machines and accessorial machines and they shall become revested in the lessor. This clause only requires an election of use between the United Company's machines and those of other makers. If the election be of the latter, the lessor may terminate the lease and resume his machines. (4) A prohibitive clause. This clause provides that the particular machine leased shall not be used in the preparation or manufacture of shoes, etc., upon which work is done by any machine not held by the lessee under lease from the lessor. (5) The right to terminate all leases clause. This clause does not need much explanation. Its name expresses its purpose. It gives the lessor the right, in default of the performance of the conditions of the particular lease, not only to cancel that lease but all other leases and requires a delivery of the leased machinery to the lessor at Beverly, Mass., complete and in good order, reasonable wear and tear alone excepted. (6) The full capacity clause. Its name expresses its purpose. It requires the leased machinery to be used to its full capacity upon the work to which it is applicable. This clause was in the lease of the Consolidated Company prior to the formation of the United Company. Its purpose is to secure the royalty which is based on the amount of use of the machine. It does not require the use of any particular machine or the use of other machines. It merely requires that the particular machine that is installed shall be used if the lessee have work for it. Without it defendants say that, as lessors, they would have no assurance of compensation for their machine. (7) A \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 63]\n\u00a0\n charge upon the return of the machinery leased is required. This needs no comment or further notice. (8) The leases of metallic machinery provide for the purchase from the lessor of certain fastening material. This clause and the next, which provides for the payment of royalties, are mere make-weights and not of special materiality.\n The evil potency ascribed to the leases (we use the word as inclusive of the clauses and we do not think it necessary to distinguish them according to their application to particular machines) by the government is their asserted coercion of shoe makers and machinery makers. They limit the freedom of the first, it is contended, and by that limitation preclude the competition of the second with the defendants. In other words, the use of the machines of the United Company is compelled as against the use of machines of other manufacturers, resulting in the restraint of the trade of the latter. To this charge all other charges are subsidiary, and the restraint is said to have been the initial conception of the company and the purpose of its organization. The evidence disproves this. As we have seen, the leasing of their respective machines was the practice of the constituent companies before their union and they were substantially the same after union as before-in instances better. There was a difference as to the prohibitive clause. After the union it related to machines of all of the companies. And the testimony also shows that the advantage of the leases was and is that manufacturers of not large means were able to obtain machinery which they were without capital to buy. They helped, indeed, the big and the little. One manufacturer whose output was 5,000 pairs of shoes a day, testified that if his company had been compelled to buy outright the machinery necessary to equip its factory, it could not have developed as it had. \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 64]\n\u00a0\n And sets of machines are necessary to the equipment of a factory, and their best results are obtained when used in proper relation. This relation, indeed, the necessary co-ordination of the machines, was shown pictorially by a number of views in the court below, as well as testified to by witnesses. And there is great economic advantage, it was testified, in the accessory service furnished by the United Company for the reason that--\n'the regularity and continuous operation of the machines is dependent upon what may be termed instantaneous service. ... This fact r of service is at the very basis of the successful operation of a shoe factory. The work is planned to travel from one room to another in fixed quantities. So many pair go in in the morning-so many pair come out at night. The operatives are dependent upon that work traveling along regularly to them. The breakdown of some of these machines will in many of the factories block the entire flow of the work.'\n\n This was the testimony of the president of the United Company, and it received corroboration from a witness for the United States, who said:\n'The margin of profit in making shoes is such that it is very essential that our machinery should work smoothly and regularly and with continuity, and economies in the manufacture of shoes often make the difference between a successful manufacturer and one who is not successful. One of the most important economies is to have our machinery work with continuity and with the highest efficiency and turn out our product with the utmost regularity day after day, just as we want to get it so that there wont be any hitch anywhere in the flow of our product through our factory.'\n\n The witness gave praise to the excellence of the machines of the United Company. This excellence and the described service the leases secured to the lessees and secured at the same time rights to the lessors. And the leases are strictly a reservation of the use of the machines, a right \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 65]\n\u00a0\n recognized in Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell, Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., and Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., supra. We must assume they were entered into by the lessees upon a calculation of their value- the efficiency of the machines balanced against the restrictions upon and conditions of their use. The lessees had the alternative of the choice of other machines, for other machines were sold side by side with those the leases covered. This, we think, is put out of view.\n Let us guard against confusion and not confound things which must be kept in distinction. A patentee is given rights to his device, but he is given no power to force it on the world. If the world buy it or use it the world will do so upon a voluntary judgment of its utility, demonstrated, it may be, at great cost to the patentee. If its price be too high, whether in dollars or conditions the world will refuse it; if it be worth the price, whether of dollars or conditions, the world will seek it. To say that the world is not recompensed for the price it pays is to attack the policy of the law, is to defy experience and to declare that the objects of inventive genius all around us have contributed nothing to the advancement of mankind. This comment is applicable here. We cannot accept, therefore, the contention of the government. We see nothing else in the circumstances of the parties than that which moves and may move the transactions of men.\n We may say further in answer to the criticism of the leases, that relaxations of them were granted by 'riders' and that forms other than the restrictive were open to the shoe manufacturers, distinguished in the testimony by the term 'independent.' They do not contain the prohibitive clause but do contain the other clauses and require an initial payment. Comparison is made of the independent form and the other forms by witnesses and various judgments are expressed. The government sees nothing in any of them but the restraints upon the freedom \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 66]\n\u00a0\n of business, and regards the independent form as only slightly relaxing what counsel implies is the slavery of the others. The defendants contend that they are the simple exercise of a property right, the mutuality of agreement based on definite and valuable considerations. And it was testified that the machines in the United Company's general department have always been open to sale or lease. It is further said that the additional-machine clauses were removed from all leases of the company as early as 1907 and they were not in use and did not represent its policy at the time of bringing this suit. But leases with that clause ar outstanding, the government replies.\n However, we need not dwell further upon the leases. It approaches declamation to say that the lessees were coerced to their making. And, as we have said, there was benefit to the lessee. It is easy to say that the leases are against the policy of the law. But when one tries to be definite one comes back to the rights and obligations of the parties. There is no question in the case of the use of circumstances to compel or restrain; the leases are simply bargains, not different from others, moved upon calculated considerations, and, whether provident or improvident, are entitled nevertheless to the sanctions of the law. We have said this, indeed, with iteration, but sometimes propositions which have become postulates have to be justified to meet objections, which, if they do not deny their existence, tend to bring them into question.\n Besides, it is impossible to believe, and the court below refused to find, that the great business of the United Shoe Machinery Company has been built up by the coercion of its customers and that its machinery has been installed in most of the large factories of the country by the exercise of power, even that of patents. The installations could have had no other incentive than the excellence of the machines and the advantage of their use, the conditions \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 67]\n\u00a0\n imposed having adequate compensation and not offensive to the letter or the policy of the law.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration and decision of the case.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY dissenting.\n I concur with the opinion of Mr. Justice CLARKE as to the character of the combination here involved.\n There are provisions in the so-called leases attacked in this case which in my view are so clearly within the condemnation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, that the further enforcement of them and the making of new leases of like character, should be enjoined. The far-reaching character of a decision sustaining a leasing system such as the defendant has developed and uses justifies a statement of the reasons which impel me to this conclusion.\n As to the suggestion that the lessees are not parties to this proceeding, and, therefore, no decree can be had as to them, it seems to me this is not a case of want of indispensable or even necessary parties because of their absence such as should prevent the court from proceeding to a decree to enjoin the United Shoe Machinery Company from the further enforcement of these features of the leases and the making of similar contracts hereafter. If these leases are in violation of the Sherman Anti- Trust Act the makers of them may be proceeded against, and a decree rendered which shall effectually preclude them from further contracts of this sort, without the presence of the lessees if it could be assumed that any of them should desire to be heard in advocacy of the retention of these prohibitive and restrictive features.\n The object of this proceeding is to enjoin in equity further \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 68]\n\u00a0\n violation of a criminal statute, not to determine title or property rights of the defendant. It is sufficient as to the doctrine of indispensable parties to refer to Shields et al. v. Barrow, 17 How. 130, and the cases collected in the discussion of the subject in Waterman v. Canal Bank, \n215 \nU.S. 33, 48\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 10. There is no reason in this case why the court may not so shape its relief as to reserve the rights of persons not before it, if that should be necessary.\n The questions involved in the aspect of the case now under consideration are two-fold. First: Are certain provisions of these lease agreements of themselves considered within the terms of the Sherman Anti- Trust Act? Second: Are such agreements to be held immune from the requirements of the act because of the fact that much, perhaps all the machinery of the United Shoe Machinery Company, is made and leased under letters patent issued by the United States? Of thes questions in their order.\n It clearly appears from the record that the United Shoe Machinery Company dominates the trade in certain kinds of shoe machinery furnished to manufacturers all over the country; which machinery is essential to the successful prosecution of the business of manufacturing shoes. It has many customers to whom it supplies these machines under leases, and such customers are required to accept the terms of these instruments or go without the machines. The leases are made for a uniform term of seventeen years, and not now considering the conditions of payment for the use of the machines and other terms usual and legal in their nature, they contain certain other features which may be summarized in the requirements: (1) The lessee shall not use the machinery, or any part thereof, in the manufacture or preparation of welted boots, shoes or other footwear which has not had certain operations performed upon it by other machines leased from the lessor. This is called the prohibitive clause. (2) \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 69]\n\u00a0\n If at any time the lessee shall fail or cease to use exclusively lasting machinery held by him under lease from the lessor, or fail or cease to use exclusively tacking mechanisms and appliances held by him under lease from the lessor, etc., the lessor may at its option terminate any or all leases or licenses of lasting machines, etc., then existing between the lessor and the lessee, and the right of possession shall thereupon vest in the lessor. This is called the exclusive use clause. (3) In case the lessee has work of the kind which can be performed by the machines belonging to the metallic department of the lessor in excess of the capacity of the metallic machinery which he has under lease from the lessor, then the lessee shall either take from the lessor sufficient additional machinery to perform the work, or failing so to do the lessor may cancel the lease forthwith, or any other lease of metallic machinery then in force between the parties. This is called the additional machines clause. (4) The lessee shall obtain from the lessor exclusively, at such prices as it may establish, all the fastening material needed in operating the leased machines. (6) The lessee shall at the election of the lessor, suffer a termination of all leases which he may have, and the removal of all machines leased by him from the defendants, in the event of any violation of any term of any one of the leases.\n From familiar decisions of this court it may be said to be now well settled that the Sherman Anti-Trust Act condemns all combinations and contracts the effect of which is to unduly restrain the free and natural flow of interstate commerce, or which monopolize or tend to monopolize such trade or commerce in whole or in part. While the act does not reach normal contracts sanctioned by law and sustained by usage, it does reach any and all means and devices by which the purposes of the act to protect the freedom of interstate commerce may be thwarted and monopolies promoted and created. United States v. American \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 70]\n\u00a0\n Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106, 179\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 632; United States v. St. Louis Terminal, \n224 U.S. 383\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 507; United States v. Reading Company, \n226 U.S. 324\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 90; United States v. Patten, \n226 U.S. 525\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 141, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 325; Eastern States Lumber Ass'n v. United States, \n234 U.S. 600\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788. That these lease restrictions tend to prevent the free flow of interstate commerce, and the natural course of its activities, and at least tend to monopolize an important trade in interstate commerce seems apparent from a mere statement of their terms, having in mind their natural and necessary effect.\n For the seventeen years term for which all the leases are drawn, the lessees upon failure to use exclusively the defendant's machines for lasting shoes, or upon failure to purchase needed additional machines from the lessor, or to buy certain supplies from t e lessor at prices to be fixed by it, are subject to the right of the lessor to terminate all the leases held by the offending lessee and to take possession of the machines to the utter destruction of the lessee's business. The necessary effect of these prohibitive provisions, in view of the dominating control of the business by the lessor, is to prevent the lessee from using other similar machines however advantageous to him it may be to do so, unless he is willing to incur the peril of losing machinery essential to his business. It likewise so curtails the field of free customers as to keep others from manufacturing such machinery. \n8\n Whenever a newmachine \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 71]\n\u00a0\n is acquired by the lessee for the period of seventeen years (the full life of a patent under the statutes of the United States) the chain is forged anew which binds him to the use of the lessor's machines, to the practical exclusion of all others.\n Nor is the situation changed by the fact that so-called independent leases are offered to manufacturers. These leases require the payment of considerable additional charges and embrace terms which lead the shoe manufacturers to choose the prohibitive and restrictive forms of leases rather than to accept others. Moreover, the questions in this case are to be tried upon the effect of the leases actually made, and for years to remain in force. When it is considered that these results may be obtained in the conduct of a great business industry by this system of 'tying' contracts, the necessary effect to restrain the freedom of commerce, and the attempt to effect monopolization, seems to me to be established.\n\n 2. \nThe stress of the argument on behalf of the company is rested upon the fact that it is the owner of letters patent issued by the United States, and that within the monopoly created by such patents it has the right to make and enforce such contracts as are herein involved. At an \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 72]\n\u00a0\n early day this court, speaking by its Chief Justice, declared:\n'The franchise which the patent grants, consists altogether in the right to exclude every one from making, using, or vending the thing patented, without the permission of the patentee. This is all that he obtains by the patent.' Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539.\n\n The extent and nature of rights secured by letters patent have been the subject of recent consideration in this court, and the definition, just quoted, has been appro ed and applied. Bauer v. O'Donnell, \n229 U.S. 1\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 616, 50 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1185, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 150; Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n243 U.S. 490\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 412, L. R. A. 1917E, 1196, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 955; Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., \n243 U.S. 502\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 416, L. R. A. 1917E, 1187, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 959; Boston Store of Chicago v. American Graphophone Co. (decided March 4, 1918), \n246 U.S. 8\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 257, 62 L. Ed.--.\n When this case was tried in the District Court Henry v. Dick, 224, U. S. 1, 32 Sup. Ct. 364, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 880, was the law of this court. In that case a mimeograph, made under letters patent, was sold for less than its full value, with a license agreement limiting its use to certain unpatented articles belonging to the patentee. Such use was held to be within the exclusive right secured by the lessor's patent. In Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., supra, it was sought to extend the doctrine of that case so as to protect a license agreement evidenced by notice attached to the machine so as to limit the purchaser to the use of certain films, and to restrict the purchaser to other terms to be fixed by the owner of the patent at his discretion. But such extended scope of patent rights was denied and it was again held that the patentee received from the law no more than the exclusive right to make, use, and sell his invention.\n It is said, however, that the series of cases beginning with Bauer v. O'Donnell, supra, and ending with Boston Store of Chicago v. American Graphophone Co., supra, decided at this term, hold no more than that a patentee may not sell an article covered by his letters patent, receive his price therefor, and then undertake to impose a restriction upon the price at which resales of the patented article may \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 73]\n\u00a0\n by made. A reading of those cases shows that the nature and extent of the right to grant to others the use of an invention was fully discussed, and its limitations defined.\n In the Motion Picture Case the right of a patentee to place restrictions upon the use of a patented machine, and to limit its use by a purchaser, or purchaser's lessee, to terms stated in the license agreement, was considered. This court held that such limitations as were there involved upon the use of patented machines were not within the scope of the patent. It was upon the expanded right to use an invention that the Button Fastener Case, 77 Fed. 288, 25 C. C. A. 267, 35 L. R. A. 728, and Henry v. Dick, \n224 U.S. 1\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 364, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 880, were rested; both cases were overruled in the Motion Picture Company Case. In the latter case it was specifically held that while the patentee might withhold his invention from public use, yet if he consented to its use by himself or others, he was limited to the use described in the claims of his patent, and that there was nothing in the statute which extended his right to control the patented invention by prescribing the use of machines, materials and supplies not covered by the patent. In view of the full discussion of the question in the series of cases already referred to, it is unnecessary to pursue it further.\n Under the system of leasing, now before us, the patentee not only undertakes to grant the use of the machines covered by the letters patent, but to dictate the supplies with which they shall be used; to compel their surrender if the machine of another is used; to prevent their use except with other machinery furnished by the patentee; to extend the monopoly of the invention beyond the 17 years allowed by the statute; to lease the use of the invention only upon terms which permit the lessor to forfeit the patent license, and to terminate, if he chooses, all similar leases to use the machines of the lessor. And these extraordinary claims of right are made under the grant of the patent which gives to the inventor the exclusive \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 74]\n\u00a0\n right to make, use, and sell his invention, and nothing m re. In my opinion such extended power and authority are not consistent with the act as the same has been construed in every case dealing with the subject beginning with the decision in Bauer v. O'Donnell. To sustain such provisions it seems to me amounts to an authority to holders of patented inventions, under the guise of leasing the use of patented machinery, to exercise the right to make combinations necessarily and unduly restraining the freedom of trade, and by virtue of the patent grant to build up monopolies in direct violation of the Sherman Act.\n True it is that there is embraced in the patent grant the right or privilege to make licenses and agreements covering the use of the machines patented so long as such agreements are not in themselves unlawful. But the right to make restrictions in controlled by the general principles of law, and because he is at liberty to make them, the patentee may not make contracts in themselves illegal and certainly is not authorized to make contracts in violation of other statutes of the United States. That rights granted under a patent do not authorize the making of contracts in restraint of trade, or monopolizing or tending to monopolize trade and commerce in violation of the Sherman Act, was held by this court in Standard Manufacturing Company v. United States, \n226 U.S. 20\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 9.\n In Straus v. American Publishing Company, \n231 U.S. 222\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 84, L. R. A. 1915A, 1099, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 369, contracts, otherwise clearly within the terms of the Sherman Act, were claimed to be justified because of rights secured under the copyright laws of the United States. Quoting and following the decision in the Standard Manufacturing Company Case, this court said:\n'So, in the present case, it cannot be successfully contended that the monopoly of a copyright is in this respect any more extensive than that secured under the patent law. No more than the patent statute was the copyright act intended \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 75]\n\u00a0\n to authorize agreements in unlawful restraint of trade and tending to monopoly, in violation of the specific terms of the Sherman law, which is broadly designed to reach all combinations in unlawful restraint of trade and tending because of the agreements or combinations entered into to build up and perpetuate monopolies. ...'\n\n The patent statute and the Sherman Act are each valid laws of the United States. While a patentee should be protected in the exercise of rights secured to the inventor under the patent system enacted into the laws of the United States, there is nothing in the Act which gives the patentee a license to violate other statutes of the United States, and certainly not the one now under consideration. In my opinion the restrictive and prohibitive clauses of these leases are within the Sherman Act, as they are clearly in restraint of interstate trade and tend to monopolize in the sense that those terms have been defined in the decisions of this court. That some of the leases were in existence when the United Shoe Machinery Company was formed affords no protection as against the exercise of the power of Congress in the passage of the Sherman Act. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467, 480\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 265, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 671. I think that a decree should be entered as prayed for, and I therefore dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in this dissent.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n A plain history of just what the parties did at and after the time the United Shoe Machinery Company was organized in February, 1899 compiled, almost exclusively, from the testimony of the two leaders in the organization and from documentary evidence, will be the best stat- \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 76]\n\u00a0\n ement I can make of the reasons other than those stated in the dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice DAY, which render it impossible for me to concur in the opinion and judgment of the court in this case.\n I fully agree with the customary practice of giving great we ght to the conclusions of trial judges as to questions of fact involved when the value of the testimony depends upon the appearance and manner of the witnesses when testifying, but the reason for this rule ceases when the evidence is in writing, or consists, chiefly, as it does in this case, of purchases of property, the significance of which lies in the fact of the purchase rather than in the manner of making it.\n Obviously, the attaching of the sole of a shoe to the upper is the difficult and dominating operation in the manufacture of shoes by machinery, and early in the trial the charge of the government in the case, by stipulation in open court, became, that the consolidation was formed for the purpose of monopolizing interstate trade or commerce in machinery adapted to that purpose, the 'bottoming of shoes,' in violation of both the first and second sections of the Anti-Trust Act of 1890.\n Before the merger the Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company (hereinafter designated the Goodyear Company) was engaged in manufacturing and leasing to shoe manufacturers two principal and sixteen auxiliary machines, the latter being used in preparing the materials of the operation of the former. The two principal machines were used for sewing the sole to the upper and were known as the Goodyear welt and turn shoe machine and the Goodyear outsole rapid lock stitch machine. With these machines, the Goodyear welt, a popular and largely used shoe, was manufactured. This company also manufactured a specially designed lasting machine used in making Goodyear welt shoes.\n The Consolidated and McKay Lasting Machine Company- \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 77]\n\u00a0\n (hereinafter designated as the Consolidated Company) was engaged in manufacturing and leasing lasting machines of three types.\n As the name of the one implies, and as otherwise appears in the record, each of these two companies had resulted from prior consolidations of shoe machine manufacturing companies and they were the largest organizations of their kind in the country.\n The controlling spirit of the Consolidated Company was S. W. Winslow, and of the Goodyear Company E. P. Howe, who, the record shows, were keen and masterful men, and they both testify that in July, 1898, they began the negotiations looking to a uniting of the interests of the two companies, which culminated in the organization of the United Shoe Machinery Company in February, 1899. A 'harmonious arrangement' or 'working agreement' was at first proposed, but Howe, being a lawyer, would not agree to this, 'because,' he says, 'I had a sort of indefinite idea that it might be deemed to be a combination in restraint of trade. ... I had an indefinite fear that if the two companies remained separate but, for instance, had a joint factory and joint branch offices, there might be something in the way of restraint of trade. I insisted, for that reason, that there should be a complete merger and consolidation.'\n This idea that the 'harmonious arrangement' was unlawful was doubtless inspired in the mind of Howe by the decision in the Trans- Missouri Freight Association Case, \n166 U.S. 290\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 540, rendered in 1897, and he probably shared a then not uncommon notion that the holding company and the merger were devices lawfully available for evading the congressional purpose expressed in the Anti- Trust Act. But in the Northern Securities Case, \n193 U.S. 197\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 436, this court decided in 1904, that the holding company was a futile device and in the American Tobacco Company Case, \n221 U.S. 106\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 632, it was decided in 1911, that the merger was also \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 78]\n\u00a0\n a mere 'subterfuge of form' which the courts would not permit to shield those who violated the act.\n Thus rejecting the 'harmonious agreement' or 'understanding' as unlawful, for the purpose of accomplishing the same end, in what they thought a not illegal way, the defendants resorted to the merger (later on, as we shall see, using also the holding company) and organized the United Shoe Machinery Company, under the laws of New Jersey, with a capital stock of $25,000,000.\n The scope of the declaration of the purposes for which this corporation was formed, as stated in its articles of incorporation, is of much significance in determining what the real objective was at which the persons interested were aiming. It is therein declared that the company is formed not only 'to manufacture, lease and sell shoe machinery,' but also 'to manufacture boots, shoes and footwear and all articles of every description that may be produced or manufactured, in whole or in part, from leather, rubber, or any other materials or fabrics, ... to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire trade-marks, trade-names, copyrights and patent rights ... and with a view to working and developing the same, to carry on any legal business whatsoever ... whether manufacturing or otherwise, which the corporation may deem calculated, directly or indirectly, to accomplish these objects or any of them. ... To hold, purchase or otherwise acquire ... shares of capital stock ... of any other corporation or corporations ... to do any or all of the above things ... in any part of the world.'\n As impressive proof of the objects of the incorporators, we print in the margin some extracts from the certificate of incorporation of the holding company, the 'United Shoe Machinery Corporation,' organized in 1905, by the \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 79]\n\u00a0\n men controlling the United Shoe Machinery Company, of 1899.9 \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 80]\n\u00a0\n And now thus equipped with apparent legal authority, amply sufficient if successfully used, to restrain and monopolize among the several states the branch of trade and commerce involved, let us see what the defendants did.\n First of all, $4,918,000 of the stock of the new company was exchanged for all of the capital stock of the Goodyear and International Goodyear Companies, and $4,432,000 of stock plus $432,000 in cash was exchanged for all of the capital stock of the Consolidated Company. By this merger, with fifteen millions of the capital stock\n___ 'To enter into partnership or into any arrangement for sharing profits, union of interest, joint adventure or co-operation with any person, partnership, association or corporation carrying on or engaged in any business which this corporation is authorized to carry on or engage in . ...\n'To do all and everything necessary or convenient for the accomplishment of the purposes, objects and powers above-mentioned, or incidental thereto, and to conduct its business, or do anything which it is authorized to do, in every state and in the territories and colonies of the United States of America and in foreign countries. ...' \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 81]\n\u00a0\n of the new company still available for other uses, the two largest manufacturers of lasting machines in the country were combined and Winslow testifies that:\n\n'After the formation of the United Company it was manufacturing every single lasting machine that was being put out in the United States except the Seaver machine; and in 1900 we acquired the Seaver Company.'\n\n Next, and immediately, although Winslow testifies that 'no word had been spoken to either the McKay people or the Eppler people when the charter for the United Company was obtained,' the company purchased the entire capital stock of the McKay Shoe Machinery Company for five and one- half million dollars of stock of the United Company. This company, Winslow testifies, was engaged in manufacturing metallic fastening machines and heeling machines, 'was doing a very large business,' and through controlled subsidiaries was 'putting out nearly all the metallic fastening machines and nearly all the heeling machines that were being made in the United States.'\n Thus, confessedly, by this union of these three companies there were consolidated substantially all of the manufacturers of lasting machines and of machines for attaching the soles of boots and shoes to uppers with metallic fastenings and with thread, and in addition to this the Davey Pegging Machine Company was owned by the Consolidated Company.\n There yet remained only one strong competitor doing business in this country, the Eppler Welt Machine Company, with an international subsidiary. Besides the Eppler there was only one other welt machine company en aged in business, the Globe, an unimportant concern which, however, was acquired by the United Company a little later, in 1901.\n Although Winslow and Howe could remember within a small fraction of a cent just what royalties were paid at any time for the use of their machines, neither of them \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 82]\n\u00a0\n could remember what was paid for the Eppler stock, and both testified that the records of the company did not show the amount. But other testimony shows that payment for it, of between $350,000 and $400,000 in cash, was made within a few weeks after the organization of the United Company, and it was admitted, significantly, that no inventory was taken at the time of the purchase of either the McKay or Eppler stock.\n That the Goodyear and Eppler machines were sharply competitive is shown by the testimony of both Winslow and Howe. Winslow testifies that just before the consolidation the Eppler Company was 'manufacturing a welting machine, an outsole stitching machine and auxiliary machines' and that the Goodyear Company was making a 'welting machine, an outsole stitching machine and auxiliary machines that performed the same function as the auxiliary machines of the Eppler Company, and a number in addition.' 'Both machines,' continues Winslow, 'were being used in the manufacture of men's welt shoes,' and 'the two welting machines that were being specially pressed on the market at that time were the Goodyear machine and the Eppler machine.' And Howe testifies:\n'Those two types of shoes were well known in the trade. There was the Goodyear welt, which was a recognized class shoe. We didn't know whether the manufacturers would prefer Eppler welts or whether they would prefer Goodyear welts.'\n\n What these two dominating spirits of the enterprise thought of their work at the stage of its development which we have thus far described, is interesting and illuminating as to their purpose. Thus, Winslow:\n'Immediately after the organization of the company our welting, outsole stitching and lasting machines were doing about all the welting, outsole stitching and lasting that was being done in the United States.\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 32, 83]\n\u00a0\n 'Q. And so with your heeling and metallic fastening machines?\n'A. Not so much the heeling.'\n\n And this from Howe:\n'When the United was formed I don't remember that any outside concerns were putting out lasting machines.'\n\n And he elsewhere says, on cross-examination, that lasting machines of the Goodyear and Consolidated Companies overlapped in the work which was done with them and, if this was true, obviously they must have been competitors in the market.\n To this must be added the statements made in circulars sent at this time to the smaller stockholders of the companies to induce them to join in the combination. Thus, to stockholders of the Goodyear Company:\n'The great advantages to be secured by the control in one corporation, both in the United States and in foreign countries, of the most efficient types of shoe machinery, have been for several years recognized by the officers of the principal large machinery companies. For more than a year your directors and large shareholders have been in negotiation to accomplish this end. After a thorough investigation of the financial condition of the business of the shoe machinery companies named below the organization of a corporation has been effected under the laws of the state of New Jersey, to be known as the United Shoe Machinery Company. ... The United Shoe Machinery Company has already contracted for more than a majority of the capital stock of [the companies named other than the Eppler Company and the Davey Pegging Machine Company] besides stocks in other machine companies and letters patent.\n\n'The United Company will from time to time acquire other machinery and property, either by direct ownership or purchase of shares of their stock.'\n\n I cannot share in estimating this circular as simply a naive expression of unusual business foresight. It was a \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 84]\n\u00a0\n confidential circular, boldly phrased, perhaps because its au hors thought that their combination had been given a character of merger which could withstand government attack, but which this court has since repeatedly held is a mere subterfuge of form. The circular is an accurate description of what had been accomplished and of what, as we shall see, the evidence in the record shows, was intended to be done in the future.\n It would seem that men who were not bent upon complete monopoly and control would have been satisfied with the advantages which, we have thus seen, those in this enterprise clearly held over any competitors who might remain or who might appear in the future. But that the man connected with the United Company were not satisfied, and were determined to make their control as perfect and permanent as possible, is shown by their further conduct during the first year of the existence of that company, as follows:\n Within a month of the organization of the United Company, on March 1, 1899, for the sum of $74,800 worth of its capital stock it purchased the control of the Goddu Company, which was manufacturing metallic fastening machines, which competed with those of the absorbed McKay Company, and the six inventors who owned the stock were bound by the contract of purchase to transfer to the United Company all inventions relating to shoe machinery, which they jointly or severally might make or have any interest in for a period of ten years; and they were also bound not to become interested 'directly or indirectly' for a like term 'in the business of making or selling any inventions or improvements relating in any way to shoe machinery,' or relating in any way to the manufacture of boots and shoes or useful in connection therewith 'without the consent in writing of the United Company.'\n On the 16th day of the same month the company purchased from Winkle and Phillips the exclusive license \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 85]\n\u00a0\n to use the inventions and improvements in sole leveling machines, described in ten letters patent of the United States and in patents of Great Britain, France and Germany, and bound the inventors to communicate to the United Company all inventions 'which they, or either of them, shall hereafter make' in sole leveling machines or sole pressing machines. Howe testifies that at the time of this purchase the United Company was making machines of the kind, but of a different type.\n On August 26, 1899, for the sum of $72,000 the company purchased the business of Timothy Bresnahan, together with the entire capital stock of the Boston Shoe Tool Company. It employed Bresnahan as manager for two years and bound him by contract not to thereafter 'engage in ... the manufacture of heel trimmings, edge trimmings or edge setting machines and tools ... or of any machines, tools or product now [then] made' by him or by the Boston Shoe Tool Company, and that he would not 'directly or indirectly aid, assist or encourage any competition with the Boston Shoe Tool Company or its business, but would do everything in his power to promote the interests of the United Company.'\n On October 11th of the same year, the company purchased from one Brewer, for $250 and $5 royalty on each machine which should be manufactured, his application for letters patent for an improvement in heel breasting machines, the one machine he had manufactured and the tools with which he had made it, and it took an assignment from Brewer 'of any and all inventions he may hereafter make, relative to breasting heels on the last.'\n The attempt made in argument to justify as familiar business practice such contracts as these, binding inventors from whom patents and other property were purchased to surrender to the United Company all of the \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 86]\n\u00a0\n fruits of their inventive genius for many years after the purchase and often for many years after their employment had ceased, is disingenuous in the extreme. In a single, terse sentence this court has made conclusive answer to such contention, saying:\n'Even if separate elements of such a scheme are lawful, when they are bound together by a common interes as parts of an unlawful scheme to monopolize interstate commerce the plan may make the parts unlawful.' Swift & Company v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 276; United States v. Reading Co., \n226 U.S. 324\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 90.\n\n On January 30, 1900, the company purchased, for the sum of $38,000, the business and assets, including twenty United States and foreign patents and 138 lasting machines, of the Seaver Process Lasting Company. This was the only independent company putting lasting machines on the market after the combination was formed, and it removed the last vestige of competition in the lasting machine business.\n This will suffice. They are typical of fifty-seven purchases proved to have been made by the United Company prior to the commencement of this suit; of shoe machinery manufacturing companies; of boot and shoe manufacturing companies; of patent rights or applications for such rights; and of the property and businesses of partnerships and corporations engaged in manufacturing appliances 'calculated,' in the language of the charter of the company, 'directly or indirectly, to accomplish the objects, or any of them, of the corporation,' and varying from sewing machine needles and awls, to tacking machines, to buttons, brushes and sandpaper. Brewer's $250 application for a patent was not too small to be overlooked, and we shall see a $6,000,000 purchase was not too great to be made in order to continue, to extend, and to make secure, the complete control over the business involved, which was first attained by the consolidation of the Good-year and Consolidated Companies \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 87]\n\u00a0\n and the purchase of the McKay and Eppler Companies in 1899.\n The history of the first year of this company would not be complete without reference to the fact that the combinations and purchases made during that year resulted in collecting under one control many hundreds of patents covering every 'shadow of a shade' of variation in the parts of the many machines used in the manufacture of shoes, and, it must be noticed, that in the month of December, 1900, the first of the forms of leases were developed and brought into use, which came to be known in the trade as 'iron clad,' and which have been discussed by Mr. Justice DAY in a dissenting opinion in which I cordially concur.\n The boot and shoe trade of the country was so restless under what was regarded and unhesitatingly denounced as a monopoly, strongly entrenched, that although the men engaged in that trade were now utterly dependent upon the United Company for the terms on which they might continue to do business, at least two groups of important manufacturers were formed before the commencement of this suit for the purpose of devising, if possible, some means of freeing themselves from conditions which they regarded, as the record abundantly shows, as oppressive and intolerable.\n Under the spur of this incentive it came to pass that a large manufacturer of shoes, one Plant, of Boston, developed a line of shoe manufacturing machinery so complete in character that on May 1, 1910, he canceled the leases which he held on many machines owned by the United Company and removed them from his factory, and advertised his readiness to supply manufacturers with adequate, and what was termed, 'wonder working shoe machinery.'\n By Winslow's own story, negotiations for the purchase of Plant's shoe machinery manufacturing business by the United Company were entered upon on June 16th, \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 88]\n\u00a0\n within two months of the time that he removed their machines from his factory. These negotiations were interrupted on July 5th, and on the 28th of the same month four suits were commenced by the United Company against Plant, two more were commenced on August 11th, two more on August 13th, and two more on September 3d. These suits were in part to recover royalties claimed for the use of the United machines before they were taken out of Plant's factory and the rest were to enjoin him from using his own machines, on the ground that they infringed pa ents of the United Company.\n Whether as a result of this familiar resort to coercive measures need not be determined, but on September 22d, at 4 o'clock in the morning, possibly to anticipate negotiations which were in progress for the purchase of Plant's property by a group of wealthy shoe manufacturers, the United Company purchased Plant's shoe machinery manufacturing business and patents, and also the control which he owned of the capital stock of a shoe manufacturing company. The United Company paid for these two properties six millions of dollars, plus $122,000 for the Stambon property, which Plant insisted must be purchased as a part of the transaction. This large sum of money, larger than was paid for either of the original constituent companies of the consolidation, was not divided in the contract of sale, but Winslow allots three and one-half millions to the purchase of the shoe manufacturing company stock and two and one-half millions to the purchase of the shoe machinery manufacturing company and patents. Even this division, it will be observed, allows two and one-half millions of dollars to be paid for the Plant machinery company property and patents, which it is now argued were of little value and at best were infringements of patents owned by the United Company. Mr. Winslow, however, thought better of them, for he says they were 'almost invaluable' to his company. \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 89]\n\u00a0\n It is impossible for me to understand how the transaction, thus described in Winslow's own words, can fail to convince any one who reads or hears the description, that the Plant Company was a formidable competitor, actual and potential, of the United Company, and that the great sum of money paid to control it was paid to stifle and restrict competition. Standing alone it shows the defendant to be an unmistakable offender against the Anti-Trust law, but when taken together with the origin of the company and with the history of the conduct of it, a small but typical part of which we have described, it seems to me a flagrant and an all but confessed offender against that law, as it has been repeatedly interpreted by this court, United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106, 179\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 632; United States v. Reading Co., \n226 U.S. 324\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 90; United States v. Patten, \n226 U.S. 525\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 141, 44 L. R.

A. 1915A, 788, and against the policy of the law as expressed in the act of Congress.\n I shall add only the convincing statement as to the complete ascendancy which the combination has attained over the important branch of the industry of the country selected for its control, which is shown in the following results tabulated in the brief of the government from the testimony, and from which all elements seriously disputed by counsel for defendants have been excluded:\n Man'f'd Man'f'd Machines in Use in this Country. by by All Defendants Others Lasting machines 7,496 7 Standard screw machines 409 None Pegging machines 146 None Tacking machines 3,488 6 Welt-sewing machines 2,527 142 Outsole stitching machines 2,676 758 Loose-nailing machines 1,835 24 Heeling machines 2,019 17 \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 90]\n\u00a0\n Further details could not add to the effect of the large outline we have thus presented. This is not a case to be decided upon the detailed statements of individuals as to their intentions or upon refined distinctions as to the application of the patent law. The design was a large one, comprehensively conceived and boldly executed. The dominating spirits of the enterprise, with the advantage of knowing precisely what they wished to accomplish, rejected a 'harmonious arrangement' of their interests as unlawful, but to accomplish the same end they adopted the scheme of merger, since condemned by this court a a mere 'subterfuge of form.'\n The trade recognized the combination as a monopoly from the beginning, and for years struggled in vain to free itself by organizing competing interests; the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, when the Clayton bill was under consideration, reported as the result of its investigations that the company appeared to be 'a monopoly that owns and controls the entire machinery now being used by all the great shoe manufacturing houses of the United States' and with a record before me such as in outline I have detailed, it is impossible for me to agree that this now securely entrenched monopoly is an innocent result of normal business development.\n The difficulties of bringing the defendants within the restraints of the law, which are regarded by the court as all but insurmountable, seem unimpressive in the presence of the resolute manner with which this court dealt with difficulties quite as complex and interests vastly greater, in the Northern Securities, Standard Oil, and Tobacco Company Cases, supra. In the last named of these cases it was found unnecessary 'in order to give effect to the requirements of the statute' to apply the remedy of restraining the movement of the products of the combination in interstate commerce, or that of appointing a receiver for the property of the offender, for* \n\n[247 U.S. 32, 91]\n\u00a0\n the simple declaration by the court of its readiness to resort to either or both of these effective remedies, if the conduct of the parties or the exigencies of the situation should require it, served in that case, as it would in this, to open the way for bringing the powerful interests involved into obedience to the law.\n Convinced as I am, by a most careful study of this record, that the United Shoe Machinery Company is a combination in restraint of interstate trade and commerce; that it was designed to and actually does monopolize a large part of that trade and commerce, and that it therefore is a continuing violation of both sections 1 and 2 of the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890, I am obliged to dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice PITNEY concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] During the trial a discussion came up about patents. The presiding judge intimated that the court did not desire to take up the patents themselves but would send them to an examiner. It was stated by counsel in the case that the matter was important. But the court made a distinction between a 'patent question' and a 'patent controversy'-good faith being an element of the latter-and stated that the latter would not be included in the hearing before the examiner, but would be heard in open court. The court then ordered the taking of testimony of both parties before the examiner as to that section of the bill which charged an unlawful extension of the patents to perpetuate their monopoly at the expense of boot and shoe manufacturers and to use them to acquire a complete monopoly of all kinds of shoe machinery. The examination took place and it was the usual battle of experts, and the conflicts are recorded in a volume of more than eight hundred pages. Their ultimate test, however, and the effect of the patents is the testimony delivered in open court. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce, among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract, or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.\n'Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] There is apparent confusion in the brief of the government In one place it is stated that the United Company was the consolidation of the businesses and properties of seven companies which were taken over as going concerns, to wit: Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company, International Goodyear Machinery Company, Consolidated & McKay Lasting Machine Company, McKay Shoe Machinery Company, Davey Pegging Machine Company, Eppler Welt Machine Company, and International Eppler Welt Machine Company.\n In another place the organization of the United Company is stated to be the merger of four companies-Goodyear Company, Consolidated & McKay Company, Eppler Company and the McKay Shoe Machinery Company-and resulted in the immediate suppression of competition between those companies and dominating 'to the point of practical exclusion the important field of supplying the principal and essential machines necessary in the manufacture of shoes.'\n However, in the conclusion of the government's brief it contends that it has established 'that there existed vigorous competition between three of the companies merged in the organization of the United Company, and that the fourth company, which at any moment might have become a competitor, was taken in for the purpose and with the effect of furthering the unlawful scheme of the combination thus brought into being.' The fourth company referred to is no doubt the McKay Shoe Machinery Company.\n The immediate results were, it is contended--\n'(1) The suppression of the actual and of the potential competition in lasting machines theretofore existing between the Consolidated & McKay Company and the Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company. It created a monopoly in lasting machines.\n\n'(2) The suppression of the actual and of the potential competition between the Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company and the Eppler Welt Machine Company. It created a monopoly of welting and outsole atitching machinery.\n\n'(3) The absolute prevention of future competition between the McKay Shoe Machinery Company, the Goodyear Shoe Machinery Company, the Eppler Welt Machine Company, and the Consolidated & McKay Company.\n\n'(4) The creation of an absolute and complete monopoly in lasting, pegging, welting, outsole stitching, heeling and metallic fastening machines.\n\n'(5) The creation of an organization with vast resources whose control of many different types of machines necessary to the shoe manufacturing industry gave it a power to extend and intrench its monopoly which none of its constituent companies, however successful, could approach.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 'Plaintiff's Exhibit 152.\n'To the Stockholders of Goodyear Machinery Company:\n\n'Boston, Mass., Feb. 8, 1899.\n\n'The great advantages to be secured by the control in one corporation, both in the United States and in foreign countries, of the efficient types of shoe machinery, have been for several years recognized by the officers of the principal shoe machinery companies.

My entire and only interest was whether those patents could be made of benefit to our customers and the trade. If they could be of benefit, if they were of large benefit, and the trade ought to have them, I should be very glad to buy them and embody them in our machines for what I thought they were worth, irrespective of what they had cost him- but I would not pay a cent more for them.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, when considering the Clayton Bill (Act Oct. 15, 1914, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730), said of such provisions:\n'Where the concern making these contracts is already great and powerful, such as the United Shoe Machinery Company, ... the exclusive or 'tying' contract made with local dealers becomes one of the greatest agencies and instrumentalities of monopoly ever devised by the brain of man. It completely shuts out competitors not only from trade in which they are already engaged but from the opportunities to build up trade in any community where these great and powerful conditions are appearing under this system and practice. By this method and practice the Shoe Machinery Company has built up a monopoly that owns and controis the entire machinery now being used by all great manufacturing houses of the United States. No independent manufacturer of shoe machines has the slightest opportunity to build up any considerable trade in this country while this condition obtains. If the manufacturer who is using machines of the Shoe Machinery Company were to purchase and place a machine manufactured by an independent company in his establishment, the Shoe Machinery Company could, under its contracts, withdraw all their machinery from the establishment and thereby wreck the business of the manufacturer.'

FERGUSON(1918)\nNo. 238\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 175, 176]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful, for the United States.\n Mr. Harry H. Rogers, of Tulsa, Okl., and Messrs. Joseph L. Hull and Nathan A. Gibson, both of Muskogee, Okl., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to cancel certain conveyances of allotted Indian lands made by the heir of the deceased allottee. In the District Court there was a decree for the defendants, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 225 Fed. 974, 141 C. C. A. 96.\n The lands formerly belonged to the Creek Tribe and were allotted and patented to Kochokney, an enrolled member of that tribe, as his part or share of the tribal domain. He died, and Yekcha, as sole heir, succeeded to the title. A considerable time thereafter Yekcha made the conveyances sought to be canceled. Under Act April 26, 1906, c. 1876,  22, 34 Stat. 137, 145, dealing with restrictions on the alienation of Creek and other allotments, he was free to make the conveyances if he was not a full-blood Indian. But, if he was a full-blood, the conveyances were void because made in violation of applicable restrictions. How the question whether he was or was not a full-blood should be determined-whether by reference to the rolls of citizenship or otherwise-is the matter in controversy.\n The legislation providing for the allotment of the lands \n\n[247 U.S. 175, 177]\n\u00a0\n of the Five Civilized Tribes, of which the Creek Tribe was one, required the commission in charge of that work to make rolls of the citizens or members of each trib , such rolls to be 'descriptive of the persons thereon,' and declared that the rolls, when approved by the Secretary of the Interior, should be 'the final rolls of citizenship.' Act June 28, 1898, c. 517,  21, 30 Stat. 495, 503; Act June 2, 1900, c. 610, 31 Stat. 250; Act March 1, 1901, c. 676,  28, 29, 31 Stat. 861, 870; Act June 30, 1902, c. 1323,  7-9, 32 Stat. 500, 501. The rolls were made and approved by the Secretary; a statement of the age, sex, and quantum of Indian blood of each member being included in the descriptive matter thereon. The act of April 26, 1906, supra, besides making the presence or absence of restrictions on the alienation of allotments dependent on the quantum of Indian blood possessed by the allottee or heir, declared that 'the quantum of Indian blood possessed by any member of said tribes shall be determined by the rolls of citizens of said tribes approved by the Secretary of the Interior.' Act June 21, 1906, c. 3504, 34 Stat. 325, 340, directed that a printed and bound copy of the approved rolls be deposited 'in the office of the recorder in each recording district for public inspection.' Printed copies were so deposited.\n While Kochokney, the father, was a member of the Creek tribe, Yekcha, the son, was a member of the Seminole Tribe. Yekcha's enrollment as shown on the approved roll was as follows:\n'Seminole Roll. Indians by Blood.\n\n'No. 1278: Name, Yekcha, Marche; age 30; sex M.; blood 1\/2. Tribal enrollment: Year, 1897; band, Echo Emarthoge; No. 1; census card No. 380.'\n\n At the trial counsel for the plaintiff, after calling attention to the fact, which was admitted, that the father was enrolled as a full-blood Creek, sought to show by \n\n[247 U.S. 175, 178]\n\u00a0\n oral testimony that the mother, whose name did not appear on any of the approved rolls, was a full-blood Seminole; but the court was of opinion that the quantum of Indian blood possessed by Yekcha must be determined by the approved roll, and so rejected the testimony. Then, interpreting the roll as meaning that he was an Indian of the half-blood, the court held that under the act of April 26, 1906, he was free to make the conveyances.\n We think the court rightly excluded the oral testimony and gave controlling effect to the approved roll. When Congress came to make a difference between full-blood and mixed-blood Indians, by subjecting the former to restrictions not applied to the latter, it evidently deemed it better for the Indians and all concerned that there be some fixed, easily accessible and reasonably reliable evidential standard by which to determine, for the purpose of the matter then in hand, who were of the full-blood and who of the mixed-blood. Congress had power to deal with the subject, and from among the standards which might have been prescribed it selected the rolls made at its direction by the commission charged with making the allotments. Not improbably it was thought that the rolls, even if not altogether free from mistake and error, would be quite as reliable as oral testimony and would have the advantage of being both easily accessible and enduring. But, passing the reason for it, Congress directed that the quantum of Indian blood 'be determined' by the approved rolls, and it did this in a connection which leaves no doubt of its purpose to give controlling effect to the rolls. Emphasis was given to this purpose in Act May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312, where in again dealing with restrictions on the alienation of allotments, it was provided that the approved rolls 'shall be conclusive as to the quantum of Indian blood of any enrolled citizen or freedman of said tribes and of no other persons to determine questions arising under this act.' \n\n[247 U.S. 175, 179]\n\u00a0\n Both the federal and state courts in Oklahoma have for several years applied the view here expressed. Bell v. Cook (C. C.) 192 Fed. 597, 604, 605; Yarbrough v. Spalding, 31 Okl. 806, 123 Pac. 843; Lawless v. Raddis, 36 Okl. 616, 129 Pac. 711.\n It hardly requires statement that the court rightly interpreted th entry of Yekcha's enrollment, before quoted. It neither names nor says anything about either parent, but does state very plainly that he is an Indian of the half-blood.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","179":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. J.S. STEARNS LUMBER CO.(1918)\nNo. 94\nArgued: December 18, 1917Decided: January 7, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 436, 437]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful, for the United States.\n Messrs. Arthur Dyrenforth and W. W. Gurley, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the court.\n The United States brought its bill to cancel patents from the state of Wisconsin held by the J. S. Stearns Lumber Company and covering certain lands in the Bad River or La Pointe Indian Reservation in the state of Wisconsin. The District Court dismissed the bill for want of equity. There is no controversy as to the facts, and it appears that the Lake Superior Chippewas by treaty of October 4, 1842, proclaimed March 23, 1843 (7 Stat. 591), ceded large tracts of land in Wisconsin and Michigan to the United States, reserving the right of hunting on the ceded territory, and other usual privileges of occupancy until removed by the President. Within the Wisconsin territory were included the sections 16 in question, lying in township 46 north, ranges 2 and 3 west, and township 47 north, in range 2 west.\n Wisconsin was admitted to the Union in 1848. The Enabling Act contained the provision as to the school sections recited in Wisconsin v. Lane, \n245 U.S. 427\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 135, 62 L. Ed. --, just decided. The President did not remove the Indians, and on September 30, 1854, a treaty was made with them, proclaimed January 29, 1855 (10 Stat. 1109), whereby the \n\n[245 U.S. 436, 438]\n\u00a0\n United States set apart the La Pointe Reservation in Wisconsin, and provided for surveys and allotments in severalty from time to time of such reserved lands in the discretion of the President.\n This reservation embraces the land in controversy; nothing was said in the treaty about sections numbered 16. The sectional survey identifying sections 16 as to one of the townships was made in 1864; as to the other two in 1873. From 1881 to 1887 the state of Wisconsin, claiming to own these lands under its school land grant, patented them to various persons, under whom the lumber company claims title.\n In 1907 allotment patents were issued by the President of the United States to the Indians in severalty under article 3 of the treaty of 1854, the allottees have since resided on the reservation, and claim the lands allotted and patented to them. The patents in each case contained a provision that the allottee and his heirs shall not sell, lease, or in any manner alienate the lands except with the consent of the President. From 1909 to 1912 timber on the lands in dispute, which had been damaged by fire, was cut for sale by the lumber company under stipulation made with approval of the United States, and the value of the lumber so realized was deposited in banks for the benefit of the parties entitled thereto, the amount so deposited was $66,833.56.\n This case does not need extended discussion, as in our opinion it is controlled by the decision of this court just rendered in Wisconsin v. Lane. The treaty of 1854 authorized the Untimate allotment in severalty to the Indians of the lands reserved by it. Afterwards such allotment of the sections in question was made by the President of the United States in carrying out the purposes of the treaty. Considering the obligations of the United States in favor of its Indian wards imposed by this treaty, and the purpose for which these lands were \n\n[245 U.S. 436, 439]\n\u00a0\n reserved, we are of opinion that the treaty with these provisions in favor of the Indians amounts to a disposition of the lands within the authority of Congress, and is not inconsistent with the Enabling Act, under which the school lands were provided for the state.\n Considering that the lands were reserved by the treaty long before they were surveyed and the sections identified, the fact that they were after survey allotted in severalty to the Indians does not in our view enable the state to claim the sixteenth sections under the school lands grant. What was ultimately done in the process of allotment was merely to provide a home for these Indians in furtherance of the purpose with which the reservation was made. See, M., K. & T. R. R. Co. v. United States, \n235 \nU.S. 37, 40\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 6.\n We are of opinion that the disposition of the lands by treaty in favor of the Indians, before the survey identifying the school sections, was but an exercise of the right of the United States to make other disposition of the lands, and the state of Wisconsin must seek indemnity elsewhere, as provided by law. It follows that the judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin must be reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or disposition of this case. \n\n\n\n","180":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. ST. PAUL, M. & M. RY. CO.(1918)\nNo. 75\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 310, 311]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful, for the United States.\n Messrs. I. Parker Veazey, Jr., of Great Falls, Mont., and E. C. Lindley, of St. Paul, Minn., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit by the United States to annul a patent issued June 24, 1907, to the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway Company (referred to below as the Manitoba Company), for certain lands in the state of Montana, upon the ground of fraud and mistake-fraud on the part of the agents of the company in representing that the land was nonmineral in character, and mistake on the part of the officers of the Land Department in failing to notify the register and receiver of the local land office that the lands had been classified as mineral and the classification sustained by the Secretary of the Interior under the act of February 26, 1895 (chapter 131, 28 Stat. 683). The District Court granted a motion to dismiss the bill upon the ground that the suit was barred by the proviso of section 1 of the act of March 2, 1896 (chapter 39, 29 Stat. 42 [Comp. St. 1916,  4901 ]); and its decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 225 Fed. 27, 139 C. C. A. 301.\n It appears that by act of March 3, 1857 (chapter 99, 11 Stat. 195), certain public lands were granted to the territory of Minnesota for the purpose of aiding in the construction of railroads, and the Manitoba Company afterwards succeeded to the rights and privileges of the territory under the granting act. At the time of the grant the Missouri river formed the western boundary of the territory; but in the following year the state of Minnesota was admitted into the Union, with its western boundary fixed on a line some distance east of that river (Act of May 11, 1858, ch. 31, 11 Stat. 285); the excluded land being \n\n[247 U.S. 310, 312]\n\u00a0\n left to become a part of the territory of Dakota (Act March 2, 1861, c. 86, 12 Stat. 239), afterwards admitted as the states of North Dakota and South Dakota. After the admission of Minnesota, the Land Department, in the administration of the land grant, rejected the claim of the Manitoba Company to lands within the limits of the grant but without the limits of that state, and recognized the rights of settlers and purchasers to Dakota lands within the limits of the grant. In St. Paul, etc., Railway Co. v. Phelps (1890) \n137 U.S. 528\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 168, this court set aside the departmental construction and sustained the company's claim to the Dakota lands. To obviate the resulting hardships to settlers and patentees, Congress passed an act of August 5, 1892 (chapter 382, 27 Stat. 390), providing that the Secretary of the Interior should cause to be prepared and delivered to the Manitoba Company a list of the lands claimed by purchasers or occupants, and, that the company should be permitted to select in lieu of these 'an equal quantity of nonmineral public lands, so classified as nonmineral at the time of actual government survey ... not reserved and to which no adverse right or claim shall have attached or have been initiated at the time of the making of such selection lying within any state into or through which the railway owned by said railway company runs, to the extent of the lands so relinquished and released.' The Montana lands here in question were selected by the company in March, 1906, and patented to it in June, 1907, in lieu of Dakota lands relinquished by the company pursuant to its acceptance of the act of 1892.\n There is no question but that the bill of complaint sets forth sufficient grounds of fraud and mistake to warrant the annulment of the patent, were it not for the bar set up under the act of March 2, 1896; and whether that bar applies is the sole matter presented for decision upon this appeal. \n\n[247 U.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n The act is entitled 'An act to provide for the extension of he time within which suits may be brought to vacate and annul and patents, and for other purposes,' and its first section reads as follows:\n'Be it enacted ... That suits by the United States to vacate and annul any patent to lands heretofore erroneously issued under a railroad or wagon road grant shall only be brought within five years from the passage of this act, and suits to vacate and annul patents hereafter issued shall only be brought within six years after the date of the issuance of such patents, and the limitation of section eight of chapter five hundred and sixty-one of the acts of the second session of the Fifty-First Congress and amendments thereto1 is extended accordingly as to the patents herein referred to. But no patent to any lands held by a bona fide purchaser shall be vacated or annulled, but the right and title of such purchaser is hereby confirmed: Provided, that no suit shall be brought or maintained, nor shall recovery be had for lands or the value thereof, that were certified or patented in lieu of other lands covered by a grant which were lost or relinquished by the grantee in consequence of the failure of the government or its officers to withdraw the same from sale or entry.' Comp. St. 1916,  4901.\n\n Laying aside other questions raised by the government, we have reached the conclusion that, having regard to the general principle which requires a strict construction to be given to legislation in derogation of the public right, and in view of the legislative history of this particular enactment, the proviso must be given the effect of a curative measure confined to lands theretofore patented, and not granting dispensation for frauds or mistakes thereafter occurring.\n It will be observed that the proviso is not a mere statute of limitation, but an absolute bar of suits by the United \n\n[247 U.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n States; not merely of suits to vacate and annul patents, but of suits to recover either the land or the value thereof; not merely in favor of bona fide purchasers, but also of the immediate recipient of an unlawful certification or patent. The general principle of public policy applicable to all governments, that the public interest should not be prejudiced by the negligence or default of public officers, which underlies the rule of strict construction for statutes of limitation, applies with peculiar force to a statute of this character.

Ct. 325; United States v. Nashville, etc., Ry. Co., \n118 \nU.S. 120, 125\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 1006; United States v. Whited & Wheless, 38 Sup. Ct. 367, \n246 U.S. 552\n, 62 L. Ed. --.\n If the language of the proviso stood alone:\n'That no suit shall be brought or maintained, nor shall recovery be had for lands or the value thereof, that were certified or patented in lieu of other lands covered by a grant which were lost or relinquished by the grantee in consequence of the failure of the government or its officers to withdraw the same from sale or entry'\n\n -it hardly would be questioned that the rule of strict construction would confine its effect to past cases presumably known to the lawmaker. Aside from a nice grammatical criticism based upon the use of the imperfect tense, full effect can be given to its language by treating it as a validation of the title of lieu lands theretofore certified or patented under the conditions mentioned. The very particular specification of the circumstances under which it was to apply, with resulting narrowness of its scope, tends to negative the inference that it was designed to lay down a general policy for the future. It conveys rather the impression of a curative measure, upon which the general presumption that legislation is intended to operate prospectively and not retrospectively can have little if any bearing. \n\n[247 U.S. 310, 315]\n\u00a0\n It is said that t is view is untenable because in the former part of the section specific reference is made to patents 'heretofore erroneously issued' and to 'patents hereafter issued,' and if Congress had intended to limit the proviso to lands certified or patented before the passage of the act it would have used appropriate and specific language for the purpose. The suggestion has weight, but we cannot regard it as determinative, in view of opposing considerations. Looking at the section as a whole, it will be seen that the proviso expresses a thought so different from what precedes that it seems almost like a separate provision inserted here for convenience, and without much regard for structural conformity with the context.\n This impression is confirmed when we review the legislative history of the measure.\n By an act of March 3, 1887 (chapter 376, 24 Stat. 556 [Comp. St. 1916 ,  4895-4900]), Congress had directed the Secretary of the Interior immediately to adjust, in accordance with the decisions of this court, railroad land grants theretofore unadjusted, with the object of restoring to the United States the title to lands erroneously certified or patented under such grants, saving the entries of bona fide settlers erroneously canceled on account of a railroad grant and the rights of bona fide purchasers from the grantee company of lands erroneously patented. The work of adjustment proved to be one of great magnitude, and it had not been completed at the time when the act under consideration was passed. Meanwhile the acts of March 3, 1891 (chapter 561,  8, 26 Stat. 1095, 1099; chapter 559, 26 Stat. 1093 [Comp. St. 1916,  4992]), had provided that suits by the United States to vacate and annul any patent theretofore issued should only be brought within five years thereafter (that is, within five years after March 3, 1891). Not long before the end of the period thus fixed, beyond which lands could not be recovered even if the investigation in progress under the 1887 act should \n\n[247 U.S. 310, 316]\n\u00a0\n disclose that they had been erroneously certified or patented, the President transmitted to Congress a special message, under date January 17, 1896 (House Doc. No. 151, 54th Cong., 1st Sess.), explaining the situation and recommending that the act of 1891 should be so amended as not to apply to suits brought to recover title to lands certified or patented on account of railroad or other grants. This was referred to the Committee on Public Lands of the House of Representatives, and that committee, not acceding to the particular recommendation of the message, reported a bill intended to give five years' additional time for bringing to a conclusion the pending investigation and adjustment, but providing that as to bona fide purchasers even this extension should not apply (Report No. 253, House of Representatives, 54th Cong., 1st Sess.; 28 Cong. Rec. pt. 2, p. 1761). The first section of the bill as reported, with which alone we are concerned, is given verbatim in the margin. \n2\n As will be observed, it contained nothing corresponding to what is now the proviso.\n The proviso was inserted, upon the motion of Mr. Lacey, chairman of the committee and in charge of the bill, while it was under consideration in the House, for the plainly declared purpose of providing for a specific case referred to in the debate as having arisen in the state of Nebraska, where lieu lands to the extent of more than 200,000 acres had been certified or patented to a railroad company to make good the loss of an equal acreage of lands within the limits of the grant due to an erroneous \n\n[247 U.S. 310, 317]\n\u00a0\n ruling of the Land Department resulting in a failure to withdraw the granted lands from entry; and upon the ground that the lieu land locations were without warrant in law, suit had been brought, and was then pending, to cancel the patents. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[247 U.S. 310, 318]\n\u00a0\n It is not our purpose to relax the rule that debates in Congress are not appropriate or even reliable guides to the meaning of the language of an enactment.

But the reports of a committee, including the bill as introducted, changes made in the frame of the bill in the course of its passage, and statements made by the committee chairman in charge of it, stand upon a different footing, and may be resorted to under proper qualifications.

The remarks of Mr. Lacey, and the amendment offered by him, in response to an objection urged by another member during the debate, were in the nature of a supplementary report of the committee; and as they related to matters of common knowledge they may very properly be taken into consideration as throwing light upon the meaning of the proviso; not for the purpose of construing it contrary to its plain terms, but in order to remove any ambiguity by pointing out the subject-matter of the amendment. This is but an application of the doctrine of the old law, the mischief, and the remedy.\n The case of the Nebraska lands, mentioned in the debate, is easily identified from public sources of infor- \n\n[247 U.S. 310, 319]\n\u00a0\n mation. By act of July 2 1864 (chapter 216,  19, 13 Stat. 356, 364), the Burlington & Missouri River Railroad Company was granted ten alternate sections per mile on each side of its road in that state. Owing to the failure of the Land Department to take the proper steps about withdrawing the land from entry, large quantities of the granted lands south of the line were taken up by settlers, and in lieu of this the company was permitted by the department to take excess lands on the north side of the line to the amount of over 200,000 acres. In United States v. Burlington, etc., R. R. Co. (1878) \n98 U.S. 334\n, 340, this court held that the grant was not limited to lands situate within twenty miles of the road, nor confined to the land opposite to each twenty-mile section of the line, as the department had held; the court saying:\n'If, as in the present case, by its [the department's] neglect for years to withdraw from sale land beyond twenty miles from the road, the land opposite to any section of the road has been taken up by others and patented to them, there can be no just objection to allowing the grant to the company to be satisfied by land situated elsewhere along the general line of the road.'\n\n At the same time the court held (\n98 U.S. 342\n):\n'The act of Congress contemplates that one-half of the land granted should be taken on each side of the road; and the department could not enlarge the quantity on one side to make up a deficiency on the other.'\n\n However, because the bill as drawn did not identify that part of the land as to which the company's patents were invalid, the decree of the Circuit Court in favor of the company was affirmed. Soon after the passage of the act of March 3, 1887, an adjustment was directed for the purpose of distinguishing the tracts erroneously patented to the company on the north side in excess of the amount to which it was entitled on that side, the excess being 200,364.70 acres, and procuring a relinquishment by the company or a cancellation of the pat- \n\n[247 U.S. 310, 320]\n\u00a0\n ents, in accordance with the act of 1887. The Burlington & Missouri River R. R. Co., 6 L. D. 589; Chapman v. Burlington & Missouri River R. R. Co., 20 L. D. 496. It appears that a suit to carry out the adjustment by vacating the erroneous patents was pending at the time of the passage of the act of 1896. The languag of the proviso was aptly chosen to bar such a suit.\n But it is said that there is no reason for confining the policy of the proviso to past patents; that if it is only fair, honest, and just that lands patented in lieu of others lost or relinquished by the grantee in consequence of some failure on the part of the government or its officers should be held by indefeasible title, the same policy would with equal reason apply to future patents. In short, the appeal is to the equity of the statute. But equity implies equality; equal fairness and honesty on both sides. If the prospective interpretation of the proviso could be confined to future patents obtained without fraud or mistake, there would be force in the argument; but suits for the annulment of patents based upon fraud or mistake are the very ones that are proposed to be barred; and in such circumstances no appeal to the equity of the statute can carry us beyond what is clearly expressed in the language of the lawmaker; equitable considerations lie on the side of a strict construction of a statutory provision that proposes to bar an equitable remedy.\n And we deem the prospective interpretation as unreasonable as it is inequitable. It was one thing for Congress to pass an act to prevent further prosecution of a suit or suits to annul patents that already had been made, unlawfully indeed, but for the purpose of making good the consequences of previous mistakes by the Land Department. Thus far it could act in the reasonable belief that it knew the extent and consequences of the immunity it was granting. But to say that where lieu lands were thereafter certified or patented in place of \n\n[247 U.S. 310, 321]\n\u00a0\n lands lost or relinquished by the grantee no suit should be maintained nor recovery had either for the lands or their value, no matter through what fraud or mistake they might be acquired, would be an entirely different matter, and would offer a premium for future wrongdoing, the extent of which could not easily be foreseen. We cannot attribute such a purpose to Congress without plainer language than is contained in this act.\n For the reasons stated, we hold that the proviso is not a bar to the present suit, brought to annul a patent applied for and issued long after its enactment; and the decree under review is\n Reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561, as amended by act of the same date, chapter 559 (26 Stat. 1099, 1093 [Comp.

Record, pt. 2, p. 1906.)\n'Mr. Hepburn: ... In another instance that I am familiar with, Mr. Speaker, in your own state [Mr. Mercer in the chair], there was a grant to a company when practically, by an error or an oversight on the part of the officers of the United States, the lands lying on the line on either side of the file plat of the road were not withdrawn from market for a considerable period. Settlers came in and took these lands. Later, when the railroad was constructed, it was found that there was not within the limits of the grant a sufficient quantity to meet the purposes of the grant. The department held that lieu lands might be given-lands in another locality-and the company was compelled to go away beyond its grant to lands that did not have the benefit of the construction of this road and take 201,000 acres, and one block of 10,000 acres of it they sold for $2, 500-25 cents an ac e; but they took these lands under the then ruling of the department. Under the advice of the law officers of the department subsequently the department changed its view. ... Then they changed the ruling and held that lands must be taken within the prescribed limits or else the entries and selections were void. Now, one of the suits ordered is to recover the title of these lands taken in lieu of those that the company lost through the failure of the federal officers to withdraw the lands from market. ...\n\n'Mr. Lacey: As to the instance that my colleague cites as having occurred in Nebraska, I propose at the proper time to offer an amendment which I think will cover the points he has in mind. I will send the amendment to the clerk's desk to be read as a part of my remarks, so that it may appear in the record for the information of members.\n\n'The amendment was read, as follows:\n\n'Add at the end of section 1: 'Provided, that no suit shall be brought or maintained, nor shall recovery be had for lands or the value thereof, that were certified or patented in lieu of other lands covered by a grant which were lost or' relinquished by the grantee in consequence of the failure of the government or its officers to withdraw the same from sale or entry.\"\n\n On the following legislative day (page 1937), the amendment was offered by Mr. Lacey, accompanied with this explanation: 'My colleague [Mr. Hepburn] on yesterday explained that in Nebraska and in some other localities 'lieu lands' had been patented in place of lands that the railroad companies had lost by reason of mistake in the department in allowing settlement upon those lands. The amendment that I offer confirms the title to those lands that have been thus patented to railroad companies where they have lost other lands by reason of mistake committed in the department.'\n The amendment was agreed to (page 1938). \n\n\n\n\n","181":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION PAC R. CO. v. LAUGHLIN(1918)\nNo. 623\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. N. H. Loomis, of Omaha, Neb., I. N. Watson, of Kansas City, Mo., and R. W. Blair, of Topeka, Kan., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Edwin A. Krauthoff, of Kansas City, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Xedes, a section hand on the Union Pacific Railroad, was injured, in Kansas, while in the performance of his duties. Laughlin, an attorney at law, was employed by him in Missouri to prosecute and settle his claim against the company; and Xedes agreed that Laughlin should receive as compensation one-half of whatever amount he \n\n[247 U.S. 204, 205]\n\u00a0\n might obtain in settlement of the claim. The Revised Statutes of Missouri ( 1909), sections 964 and 965, authorizing such agreements, give to the attorney a lien on the cause of action and on the proceeds, if notice of the lien is duly given to the defendant or 'proposed defendant'; and, as construed by the Supreme Court of Missouri,1 they also provide that if, after such notice, the claim is settled in any manner without first procuring the written consent of such attorney, the defendant or 'proposed defendant' shall be liable to the attorney in an independent suit to an amount equal to that for which he held the lien.\n Laughlin gave to the company this statutory notice. Later and without his consent, Xedes brought, through other counsel, in a state court, suit against the company which was removed to the District Court of the United States for the Western Division of the Western District of Missouri, and judgment was entered therein for $550. The company paid this amount to the clerk of court in satisfaction of the judgment; and it was paid by him to Xedes and his new counsel. When Laughlin learned these facts, he brought suit against the company in Missouri before a justice of the peace, for $ 275, and recovered a judgment therefor which was affirmed in the state circuit court and again by the Kansas City Court of Appeals. A rehearing applied for in June, 1917, was denied by that court, which also refused to transfer the case to the Supreme Court. The company, contending that the federal Constitution has been violated, brings the case here under section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended.\n It does not appear here, as it did in Dickinson v. Stiles, \n246 U.S. 631\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 415, 62 L. Ed. -- (decided April 29, 1918), that the suit of the employe against the railroad was brought under the federal Employers' Liability Act (Act April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 [Comp. St. 1916,  8657-8665]); and no claim is made that the attorney's lien \n\n[247 U.S. 204, 206]\n\u00a0\n statute of the state is inconsistent with that law or the constitutional provision concerning interstate commerce. The company's contention, as set forth in its assignment of error in this court, is that the decision below takes its property and denies to it equal protection of the law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, because the decision imposes a liability not imposed by the judgment recovered by Xedes in the federal court; deprives it of the protection afforded by the Acts of Congress to those who pay to the clerks of the United States District Courts money in satisfaction of judgments entered therein;2 and gives to two attorneys liens for the same service. The defendant in error moves to dismiss on the ground that the case does not present a federal question reviewable under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156 ), as amended by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448,  2 (39 Stat. 726 [ Comp. St. 1916,  1214]), because there is not drawn in question the validity of a statute of or an authority exercised under any state on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States; and that if such question is presented, the Kansas City Court of Appeals was not 'the highest court of a state in which a decision in the suit could' have been had, since the Supreme Court of Missouri has appellate jurisdiction in cases where 'the validity of a treaty or statute of or authority exercised under the United States is drawn in question,' and no application was made to nor any action taken by it.\n The Missouri statute simply gives a cause of action against one who, with knowledge of the existence of a lien, deforces it. To grant such a remedy against the wrongdoer clearly does not deprive him of any right guaranteed by the federal Constitution, even if the \n\n[247 U.S. 204, 207]\n\u00a0\n instrument by means of which the wrong is accomplished happens to be the judgment of a federal court. No substantial federal question is involved. We have no occasion, therefore, to consider whether the validity of the Missouri statute was drawn in question (Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co. v. Gilbert, \n245 U.S. 162\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 58, 62 L. Ed. --); nor whether 'a decision in the suit' might not have been had in the Supreme Court of Missouri (Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company v. Elliott, \n184 U.S. 530\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 446).\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] O'Connor v. St. Louis Transit Co., 198 Mo. 622, 645, 97 S. W. 150, 115 Am.

HADLEY(1918)\nNo. 174\nArgued: March 7, 1918Decided: March 18, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 330, 331]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Nelson H. Loomis, of Omaha, Neb., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. John J. Halligan, of North Platte, Neb., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65, for causing the death of Cradit, the plaintiff's (the defendant in error's) intestate. The case was brought to this Court before the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 727, \n\n[246 U.S. 330, 332]\n\u00a0\n and with the exception of one or two matters that need a word, presents only the ordinary questions of negligence that it is not our practice to discuss at length.\n The deceased was a brakeman on an eastbound freight train known an Extra 504 East. At Dix, in Nebraska, it was overtaken by another eastbound train known as Extra 501 East. There is a single track from Dix to Mile Post 426, 17 miles distant, and train 504 went ahead to this latter point. Train 501 followed for about half the distance to Potter and was held there until 504 had reached Mile Post 426, seven miles further on, when 501 was started on again, leaving its conductor there. But an Extra 510 West had broken down at Mile Post 426 and the train dispatcher at Sidney, about twelve miles still further east, ordered train 504 to take the disabled engine of 510 back to Sidney. The engineer asked the dispatcher to allow 504 to go on and to let 501, when it came up, take back the engine of 510, but it was refused. No. 501 came up, ran into 504 and killed Cradit and some others. The plaintiff says that the accident was due to at least contributory negligence of the railroad-the defendant that it was not negligent, that Cradit would not have been killed if he had done his duty and had gone back to warn the following train by lights, torpedoes, &c., instead of remaining in the caboose, as he did, and that this was the proximate cause of his death.\n On the question of its negligence the defendant undertook to split up the charge into items mentioned in the declaration as constituent elements and to ask a ruling as to each. But the whole may be greater than the sum of its parts, and the Court was justified in leaving the general question to the jury if it thought that the defendant should not be allowed to take the bundle apart and break the sticks separately, and if the defendant's conduct viewed as a whole warranted a finding of neglect. Upon that point there can be no question. We are not \n\n[246 U.S. 330, 333]\n\u00a0\n left to the mere happening of the accident. There were block signals working on the road that gave automatic warning of danger to 501, and which it was negligent to pass, seen or unseen, as the engine crew knew where they were and that another train was not far ahead. There was a snow storm raging which the jury might have found to have been of unprecedented violence, and it was open to them to find in view of circumstances unnecessary to detail that the dispatcher ought not to have sent out Extra 510 West as he did and that he was grossly wrong in not allowing 504 to come in and in not leaving it to 501 to bring back the disabled engine. It might have been found improper to leave the conductor of 501 at Potter. It is superfluous to say more upon this point.\n But it is said that in any view of the defendant's conduct the only proximate cause of Cradit's death was his own neglect of duty. But if the railroad company was negligent it was negligent at the very moment of its final act. It ran one train into another when if it had done its duty neither train would have been at that place. Its conduct was as near to the result as that of Cradit. We do not mean that the negligence of Cradit was not contributory. We must look at the situation as a practical unit rather than inquire into a purely logical priority. But even if Cradit's negligence should be deemed the logical last, it would be emptying the statute of its meaning to say that his death did not 'result in part from the negligence of any of the employes' of the road. Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149,  1, 35 Stat. 65. In Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Wiles, \n240 U.S. 444\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 406, it appeared that the only negligence connected with the death was that of the brakeman who was killed.\n The Court after instructing the jury that Cradit assumed the ordinary risks of his employment, but not extraordinary ones, in a form that is not open to criticism here, instructed them further that he was guilty of contributory \n\n[246 U.S. 330, 334]\n\u00a0\n negligence, and that, under the statute, if the jury found it necessary to consider that defence, his negligence was to go by way of diminution of damages in proportions explained. The jury in answer to a question found that nothing should be deducted for the negligence of the deceased, and found a verdict for $25,000, which was cut down to $15,000 by the trial Court, and to $13,500 by the Supreme Court. There were intimations that the jury disregarded the instructions of the Court, and on the footing the defendant claims the right to a new trial in order that the jury may determine the proper amount to be deducted, since that was a matter that the Court had no right to decide. But however the belief that the jury had disregarded the instructions may have influenced the mind of the Court, we perceive no legal warrant for the assumption. The account of the weather and other circumstances on the plaintiff's side made it possible for the jury to believe that Cradit's duty was so nearly impossible of performance that no substantial allowance should be made on that account. It does not appear that his superior, the conductor, who was in the caboose with him, required him to perform the task. And since the finding was possible on the evidence it cannot be attributed to disregard of duty. The Court had the right to require a remittitur if it thought, as naturally it did, that the verdict was too high. Beyond the question of attributing misconduct to the jury we are not concerned to inquire whether its reasons were right or wrong.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","183":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION PAC.

Huxoll, a locomotive engineer in the employ of the plaintiff in error, was run down by a switching engine, about 11 o'clock in the morning, in a switching yard of the company at a division point in Nebraska, and subsequently died of the injuries which he received.\n The weather was very cold, with a high wind blowing and a cloud of steam and smoke, from engines standing nearby the scene of the accident and from a roundhouse farther away, had settled down upon the tracks, and it was while passing through this that the deceased was struck by the engine. This cloud of steam and smoke is described by one witness as extending 300 or 400 feet along \n\n[245 U.S. 535, 537]\n\u00a0\n the tracks, and by another for about 100 to 200 feet.

Huxoll was walking eastward through this cloud of smoke and steam and was between the rails of one of the tracks when an engine backing toward the west struck him in such a manner that the tender passed over him, and when the engine was stopped he was opposite the main driving wheel, with his right wrist under the wheel on the rail.\n Judgment was rendered by the trial court on a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nebraska, and, the case being one to which the federal Employers' Liability Act is applicable, it is now here on writ of error.\n There are many claims of negligence in the petition, but the court submitted only three of them to the jury, and of these we need consider but one instruction, viz.:\n Was the power brake on the engine in working order at the time of the accident, and if it was not, did this defect contribute 'in whole or in part' to cause the death of Huxoll?\n The oral argument of counsel for the plaintiff in error was practically confined to the proposition that the trial court committed reversible error in submitting these questions to the jury, for the reason that, even if it be assumed (as it must be for there is sharp conflict on the point) that the power brake was not in working order, there was no substantial evidence in the case that this failure contributed 'in whole or in part' to cause the death of Huxoll.\n The engineer did not see the deceased at the moment he was struck, and it is argued that there is no substantial evidence to show how much farther the engine ran after he was notified of the accident than it would have run if the power brake had been properly applied, or that \n\n[245 U.S. 535, 538]\n\u00a0\n the running of the engine such distance, whatever it may have been, added anything to the injuries of the deceased and so contributed to cause his death.\n It is necessary for us to examine the evidence in the record to determine the validity of this claim for the reason that it presents a federal question, not of fact but of law (Creswell v. Knights of Pythias, \n225 \nU.S. 246, 261\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 822; Seaboard Air Line v. Padgett, \n236 \nU.S. 668, 673\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 481), and it relates to the only negligence claimed in the case which, if proved, would relieve the defendant in error, as the charge of the court in the instruction we are considering relieved her, from the necessity of having her recovery diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to her decedent, who was obviously guilty of contributory negligence in walking on the track under the conditions shown.\n The federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908 (35 Stat. L. 65, c. 149; Comp. St. 1916,  8657-8665) is confessedly applicable to the case and the rule of liability prescribed by this and the Safety Appliance Act of March 2, 1893 (27 Stat. L. 531, c. 196; Comp. St. 1916,  8605- 8612), is, as the trial court charged, that if the failure to have the power brake in working order contributed 'in whole or in part' to cause the death of deceased, the plaintiff in error would be liable in damages and neither contributory negligence nor assumption of risk could avail the company as a defense or in diminishing the damages.\n There is conflict in the evidence; as to the speed at which the engine was moving when it entered the cloud of steam and smoke, the estimates vary from 3 miles to 10 miles an hour; a to the distance within which the engine with the power brake properly working could have been stopped under the conditions which existed at the time of the accident, the estimates vary from 'almost instantly'-8 to 10 feet-to 40 feet; as to when the engineer received notice that the deceased had been struck, the statements vary, from almost the instant the \n\n[245 U.S. 535, 539]\n\u00a0\n man was struck, to considerably later; as to the distance which the engine ran after striking the deceased, the estimates vary from 30 to about 135 feet; as to the distance which the engine ran after the engineer had notice of the accident, the engineer testified at one time that he thought it did not exceed 40 feet, while other testimony tended to show that it must have been considerably more than 100 feet; and as to the lookout which the engineer was keeping when the accident occurred.\n The first wheel to actually strike the deceased was the 'main' driving wheel-the middle one of the three-and this was standing on his right wrist when the engine was stopped, so that the entire tender and quite one-half of the engine proper, including the fire box, passed over his body which was found so wedged beneath the engine that it was necessary to remove the brakerods to release him.\n The deceased was not instantly killed but was conscious and talked some during the forty-five minutes which elapsed before he was released from under the engine and also later in the day while on the way to the hospital at Cheyenne, and he did not die until 2 o'clock the next morning. The injuries which caused his death are not described beyond the bare statement that the driving wheel rested on the wrist of his right arm, that that arm was found afterwards to be torn from the shoulder and that his scalp was badly cut.\n Considering this conflicting testimony in the aspect of it least favorable to the company, as we must on this review, it results that there is evidence tending to show, that while the engineer did not see the man struck, he was notified almost instantly by a call to stop from the one witness who says he saw him struck, and that if the power brake had been working the engineer could have stopped his engine, running 3 or 4 miles an hour, 'almost instantly,' 'in 8 to 10 feet,' but that in fact it \n\n[245 U.S. 535, 540]\n\u00a0\n ran for approximately 135 feet after striking the deceased, with his body under the tender or engine almost the entire time.\n Demonstration is not required in such a case as we have here but responsibility for the accident must be determined upon the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the evidence, and it is impossible for us to conclude that the conflict which we have thus described does not present evidence sufficient to justify the submitting of the case to the jury for its determination as to whether the deceased, who survived the accident for 15 hours, received injuries which contributed in part, at least, to the fatal result, during the time that the engine was being negligently run for a distance which there is evidence tending to show was at least 100 feet, with his body all the time being dragged and crushed between the frozen ballast of the track, the low-hanging attachments of the tender and the rods of the driving wheel brakes with which his body was found so entangled that it required 45 minutes to release him from his desperate situation. It is significant that the men who were there, with all of the conditions before their eyes, thought that further movement, even the slightest, of the engine, would result in further injury to the deceased and that, for this reason, they would not permit it to be moved at all, but thought it necessary to remove the brakerods in order to release him, even though this required that he be exposed to the cold in much below zero weather for 45 minutes.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Nebraska must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","184":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION PAC. R. CO. v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF MISSOURI(1918)\nNo. 65\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. N. H. Loomis, of Omaha, Neb., H. W. Clark, of New York City, and I. N. Watson, of Kansas City, Mo., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. A. Z. Patterson, of Jefferson City, Mo., for defendant in error. \n\n[248 U.S. 67, 68]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case concerns the validity of a charge made by the Public Service Commission of Missouri for a certificate authorizing the issue of bonds secured by a mortgage of the whole line of the Union Pacific road. The statutes of Missouri have general prohibitions against the issue of such bonds without the authority of the Commission, impose severe penalties for such issue and purport to invalidate the bonds if it takes place. Moreover the bonds would be unmarketable if the certificate were refused. Upon these considerations the plaintiff in error applied, in all the States through which its line passed, for a certificate authorizing the issue of bonds to the amount of $31,848,900. The Missouri Commission granted the authority and charged a fee of $10,962.25. The Railroad Company accepted the grant as required by its terms, but protested in writing against the charge as an unconstitutional interference with interstate commerce, and gave notice that it paid under duress to escape the statutory penalties and to prevent the revocation of the certificate. It moved for a rehearing on the ground that the statutes of Missouri, if they gave the Commission jurisdiction, did not purport to authorize the charge, or, if they did purport to do so and to invalidate an issue without the Commission's assent, were in conflict with the Constitution of the United States. The rehearing was denied and thereupon the Railroad, pursuant to State Law, applied to a local Court for a certiorari to set \n\n[248 U.S. 67, 69]\n\u00a0\n the Commission's judgment aside as an interference with interstate commerce and as bad under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court decided that the charge was unreasonable and that the minimum statutory fee of $250 should have been charged. On appeal by the Commission the Supreme Court held the Railroad estopped by its application, reversed the Court below and upheld the charge. 268 Mo. 641, 187 S. W. 827.\n The Railroad Company is a Utah corporation having a line over thirty- five hundred miles long, extending through several States, from Kansas City, Missouri, and elsewhere, to Ogden, Utah. It has only about six- tenths of one mile of main track in Missouri, and its total property there is valued at a little more than three million dollars, out of a total valuation of over two hundred and eighty-one millions. The bonds were to reimburse the Company for expenditures of which again less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars had been made in Missouri. The business done by the Railroad in Missouri is wholly interstate. On these facts it is plain, on principles now established, that the charge, which in accordance with the letter of the Missouri statutes, was fixed by a percentage on the total issue contemplated, was an unlawful interference with commerce among the States. Looney v. Crane Co., \n245 \nU.S. 178, 188\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 85; International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 U.S. 135\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 292, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617.\n The Supreme Court of the State avoided this question by holding that the application to the Commission was voluntary and hence that the Railroad Company was estopped to decline to pay the statutory compensation. It is argued that a decision on this ground excludes the jurisdiction of this Court. But the later decisions show that such is not the law and that on the contrary it is the duty of this Court to examine for itself whether there is any basis in the admitted facts, or in the evidence when the facts are in dispute, for a finding that the federal \n\n[248 U.S. 67, 70]\n\u00a0\n right has been waived. Creswill v. Grand Lodge Knights of Pythias, \n225 U.S. 246\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 822. Were it otherwise, as conduct under duress involves a choice, it always would be possible for a State to impose an unconstitutional burden by the threat of penalties worse than it in case of a failure to accept it, and then to declare the acceptance voluntary, as was attempted in Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. O'Connor, \n223 U.S. 280\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 216, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1050\n\n\n On the facts we can have no doubt that the application for a certificate and the acceptance of it were made under duress. The certificate was a commercial necessity for the issue of the bonds. The statutes, if applicable, purported to invalidate the bonds and threatened grave penalties if the certificate was not obtained. The Railroad Company and its officials were not bound to take the risk of these threats being verified. Of course, it was for the interest of the Company to get the certificate. It always is for the interest of a party under duress to choose the lesser of two evils. But the fact that a choice was made according to interest does not exclude duress. It is the characteristic of duress properly so called. The Eliza Lines, \n199 \nU.S. 119, 130\n, 131 S., 26 Sup. Ct. 8, 4 Ann. Cas. 406. If, as may be, the Supreme Court of the State regards or will regard this statute as inapplicable, Public Service Commission v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 271 Mo. 258, 197 S. W. 39, probably the State would not wish to retain the charge, but we repeat, the Railroad Company was not bound to take the risk of the decision, and no proceeding has been pointed out to us by which it adequately could have avoided evils that made it practically impossible not to comply with the terms of the law. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. R. Co. v. O'Connor, \n223 \nU.S. 280, 286\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 216, Ann.

WELD COUNTY(1918)\nNo. 22\nArgued: November 15, 1916Decided: June 3, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 282, 283]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Clayton C. Dorsey, of Denver, Colo., and N. H. Loomis, of Omaha, Neb., for appellant.\n Mr. Charles F. Tew, of Greeley, Colo., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the Union Pacific Railroad Company to enjoin the collection of a portion of the taxes levied on its property in Weld county, Colorado, in a particular year, the gravamen of the complaint being that the company's property was assessed at one-third of its value, while most of the other property was assessed at one-fifth and some not at all, and that this operated to place an undue burden of taxation on the company contrary to the Constitution and laws of the state and to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. A portion of the taxes was conceded to be valid and was paid. The portion in dispute amounts to $31,127.37. An application for a temporary injunction, submitted on affidavits and other proofs, was denied by the District Court, and that interlocutory order was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals ( 217 Fed. 540, 133 C. C. A. 392; 222 Fed. 651, 138 C. C. A. 175), both courts being of opinion that relief by injunction was not admissible because there was a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law. While that \n\n[247 U.S. 282, 284]\n\u00a0\n view might have resulted in a final decree dismissing the bill, such a decree was neither entered in the District Court nor directed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. In other words, an amendment of the bill and further proceedings were not precluded.\n An appeal to his court from the affirmance of the District Court's interlocutory order was allowed, but the appeal is without statutory sanction and must be dismissed. Anticipating that this might be so, the company presented a petition for a writ of certiorari under section 262 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1162 [Comp. St. 1916,  1239])-see McClellan v. Carland, \n217 U.S. 268\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 501; United States v. Beatty, \n232 \nU.S. 463, 467\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 392; Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n234 U.S. 749\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 674-consideration of which was postponed to the hearing on the appeal. We now grant the petition and treat the record on the appeal as the return to the writ. See Farrell v. O'Brien, \n199 \nU.S. 89, 101\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 727; White-Smith Music Co. v. Apollo Co., \n209 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 319, 14 Ann. Cas. 628.\n For many years the revenue laws of Colorado have contained a section1 imposing on the board of county commissioners 'in all cases' the duty of refunding to the taxpayer 'without abatement or discount' 'any tax, interest or costs, or any part thereof,' which is found to have been 'erroneous or illegal,' and by a necessary implication conferring on him a correlative and substantive right to have the same so refunded. Laws 1870, p. 123,  106; 2 Mills Ann. Stat.  3777; Laws 1902, c. 3,  202; Rev. Stat. 1908,  5750; Prico v. Kramer, 4 Colo. 546, 555; Woodward v. Ellsworth, 4 Colo. 580, 581; Hallett v.

If that section is still in force, unqualified and unmodified, the conclusion below that in this case there is a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law, and therefore that relief by injunction is not admissible, is fully sustained by our decisions. Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Benedict, \n229 U.S. 481\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 942, and cases there cited; Pittsburg, etc., Ry. Co. v. Board of Public Works, \n172 U.S. 32\n, 19 Sup.

Cas. 1917E, 88.\n That the taxes were levied for state, school district and town, as well as for county, purposes is not material; for it is apparent from the Colorado statutes and decisions that the section covers broadly the whole of the tax that is found to have been erroneous or illegal, regardless of the purpose for which it was levied and placed on the county tax roll. And it also is immaterial that the taxes were made a lien on the company's real property, for the lien would be effectually removed by paying them and suing to recover back the money. Allen v. Pullman's Palace Car Co., \n139 \nU.S. 658, 661\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 682; Arkansas Building and Loan Ass'n v. Madden, supra, \n175 U.S. 273\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 119.\n Whether the section named is still in force, unqualified and unmodified, is the important question. If not in force, a single action at law would not suffice, for then it would be necessary to bring a separate action against each of several school districts and towns for its part of the tax. See Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co., supra, \n207 \nU.S. 39, 40\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 7, 12 Ann. Cas. 757. And if the section has been so qualified and modified that the continued existence of the right originally conferred on the taxpayer is involved in uncertainty, an essential element of the requisite remedy at law is wanting; for, as this court has said:\n'It is a settled principle of equity jurisprudence that, if the remedy at \n\n[247 U.S. 282, 286]\n\u00a0\n law be doubtful, a court of equity will not decline cognizance of the suit. ... Where equity can give relief, plaintiff ought not to be compelled to speculate upon the chance of his obtaining relief at law.' Davis v. Wakelee, \n156 \nU.S. 680, 688\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 555.\n\n In 1911 Colorado established a state tax commission and conferred on it extensive supervisory powers over the administration of the revenue laws of the state, including the acts of assessors and boards of county commissioners. Laws 1911, c. 216. And in 1913, before the pres nt suit was begun, the state adopted a statute extending the powers of the commission and repealing 'all acts or parts of acts in conflict' therewith. Laws 1913, c. 134. The fifth section of that act says:\n'No abatement, rebate or refund of taxes shall be allowed by the county commissioners, unless a hearing shall be had thereon and a notice of such hearing and an opportunity to be present being [be] first given to the assessor, and in case any abatement, rebate or refund of taxes shall be recommended by said county commissioners, they shall certify to the Colorado tax commission their findings, giving the amount of such abatement, rebate or refund, and their reasons therefor, and such abatement, rebate or refund shall become effective upon the indorsement thereon of the approval of the Colorado tax commission and in case the said Colorado tax commission shall disapprove the recommendation of the county commissioners, they shall indorse their disapproval thereon and return it to the county commissioners with a statement of their reasons therefor and no abatement, rebate or refund of taxes shall be allowed by the said board of county commissioners if the application is disapproved by the said Colorado tax commission.'\n\n Counsel differ widely respecting the effect of this statute on the earlier section (section 5750, Rev. Stat. 1908) and on the substantive right given by it to have an erroneous \n\n[247 U.S. 282, 287]\n\u00a0\n or illegal tax refunded. On the one hand it is said that neither the earlier section nor the right thereby conferred is in any wise affected, and that one paying an erroneous or illegal tax still may call on the county board to refund it and, if the application be refused, has a right of action to compel the board to refund. On the other hand, it is said that the new statute qualifies and modifies the earlier section by restricting the power and duty of the county board to refund to instances in which the state tax commission approves the application, and that the correlative right of the taxpayer under the earlier section-the right impliedly arising out of the duty imposed on the county board-is qualified and modified accordingly; in other words, that the new statute prohibits any refunding of taxes by the county board save in instances having the approval of the state commission and that in other instances it operates to withdraw from the taxpayer all right of action against the county board under the earlier section.\n An examination of the new statute shows that the controversy just outlined is not without some real basis and that its solution is not free from difficulty. The question is purely one of state law, and, so far as we are advised, the Supreme Court of the state has not passed on or considered it. A ruling by us on the question would neither settle it for that court nor be binding in an action to recover the tax if paid. In these circumstances it cannot be said that the company certainly or plainly has an adequate and complete remedy at law. On the contrary, the existence of such a remedy is debatable and uncertain. And this being so, the situation is not one in which cognizance of the present suit properly can be declined.\n With the question of equitable jurisdiction out of the way, the District Court should dispose of the application for a temporary injunction on the merits and otherwise proceed with the suit in regular course. The controverted questions of fact arising on that application have not been \n\n[247 U.S. 282, 288]\n\u00a0\n considered by us and we intimate no opinion respecting them. Such questions are rarely, if ever, regarded as properly subject to examination here on writ of certiorari.\n Appeal dismissed; certiorari granted, record on appeal to stand as return to writ; decrees below reversed and cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '... And in all cases where any person shall pay any tax, interest or costs, or any portion thereof, that shall thereafter be found to be erroneous or illegal, whe her the same be owing to erroneous assessment, to improper or irregular levying of the tax, or clerical or other errors or irregularities, the board of county commissioners shall refund the same without abatement or discount to the taxpayer.' \n\n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION TRUST CO. v.

McCormick, of Dallas, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the petitioner in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas upon two promissory notes made in Chicago by Hiram Grosman and another, and a continuing guaranty executed in the same place by the respondent, Mrs. Grosman, the wife of Hiram Grosman, as part of the same transaction as the earlier note. A decree was rendered for the plaintiff in the District Court, but upon appeal by Mrs. Grosman was reversed as against her by the Circuit Court of Appeals, on the ground that it subjected her separate property to the payment of the demand, contrary to the public policy of the State in which the suit was brought. 228 Fed. 610, 143 C. C. A. 132, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 613. Mrs. Grosman and her husband were domiciled in Texas, as the plaintiff seems to have known, and made the contracts while temporarily in Chicago. We assume for the moment that if she had given the guaranty in Texas it would have been void, and on the other hand that if she had been domiciled in Illinois when she made her promise she would have been bound. The main question is which law is to prevail.\n If this suit were brought in Illinois it would present broader issues. On the one side would be decisions that locus regit actum, and the consideration that when a woman goes through the form of contracting in an independent State, theoretically that State has the present* \n\n[245 U.S. 412, 416]\n\u00a0\n power to hold her to performance, whatever may be the law of her domicile. It might be urged that the contract should be given elsewhere the effect that the law of the place of making might have insured by physical force. See Michigan Trust Co. v. Ferry, \n228 \nU.S. 346, 353\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 550. On the other hand it is obvious that practically at least no State would take any steps, if it could, before a breach of an undertaking like this. The contract being a continuing one of uncertain duration the plaintiff had notice that in case of a breach it probably might have to resort to the defendant's domicile for a remedy, as it did in fact. In such a case very possibly an Illinois Court might decide that a woman could not lay hold of a temporary absence from her domicile to create remedies against her in that domicile that the law there did not allow her to create, and therefore that the contract was void. This has been held concerning a contract made with a more definite view to the disregard of the laws of a neighboring State. Graves v. Johnson, 156 Mass. 211, 212, 30 N. E. 818, 15 L. R. A. 834, 32 Am. St. Rep. 446.\n But when the suit is brought in a court of the domicile there is no room for doubt. It is extravagant to suppose that the courts of that place will help a married woman to make her property there liable in circumstances in which the local law says that it shall be free, simply by stepping across a State line long enough to contract.

There is nothing opposed to this view in those decisions in which the Courts have enforced similar contracts of women domiciled where the law allowed such contracts to be made. It is one thing \n\n[245 U.S. 412, 417]\n\u00a0\n for a Court to decline to be an instrument for depriving citizens belonging to the jurisdiction of their property in ways not intended by the law that governs them, another to deny its offices to enforce obligations good by the lex domicili and the lex loci contractus against women that the local laws have no duty to protect.

The case of Milliken v. Pratt, 125 Mass. 374, 28 Am.

If the statutes have not gone so far as to enable a woman to bind her separate property or herself in order to secure her husband's debts, they prohibit it, and no argument can make it clearer that the policy of that State is opposed to such an obligation. It does not help at all to point out the steps in emancipation that have been taken and to argue prophetically that the rest is to come. We have no concern with the future. It has not come yet. The only question remaining, then, is whether the Court below was right in its interpretation of the Texas law. This was not denied with much confidence and we see no sufficient reason for departing from the opinion of the Court below and the intimations of all the Texas decisions that we have seen. Red River National Bank v. Ferguson, (Tex. Civ. App.) 192 N. W. 1088; Shaw v. Proctor (Tex. Civ. App.) 193 S. W. 1104; Akin v. First National Bank of Bridgeport (Tex. Civ. App.) 194 S.

An appeal was allowed by one of the judges of that court, and afterwards we allowed a writ of certiorari. Pursuant to a stipulation, the transcript of the record filed for the purposes of the appeal was treated as a return to the writ. Under section 128, Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1133), as amended by Act of January 28, 1915 (38 Stat. 803, c. 22,  2; Comp. St. 1916,  1120), the appeal must be dismissed, and the cause will be determined on the writ of certiorari. \n\n[248 U.S. 90, 94]\n\u00a0\n The essential facts are as follows: About the year 1877 Ellen M. Regis, a resident of Haverhill, Mass., began to compound and distribute in a small way a preparation for medicinal use in cases of dyspepsia and some other ailments, to which she applied as a distinguishing name the word 'Rex'-derived from her surname. The word was put upon the boxes and packages in which the medicine was placed upon the market, after the usual manner of a trade-mark. At first alone, and afterwards in partnership with her son under the firm name of %'e. m. r\/egis & Co.,' she continued the business on a modest scale; in 1898 she recorded the word 'Rex' as a trade- mark under the laws of Massachusetts (Acts 1895, p. 519, c. 462,  1); in 1900 the firm procured its registration in the United States Patent Office under the Act of March 3, 1881 (21 Stat. 502, c. 138); in 1904 the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts sustained their trade-mark right under the state law as against a concern that was selling medicinal preparations of the present petitioner under the designation of 'Rexall Remedies' (Regis v. Jaynes, 185 Mass. 458, 70 N. E. 480); afterwards the firm established priority in the mark as against petitioner in a contested proceeding in the Patent Office; and subsequently, in the year 1911, petitioner purchased the business with the trade-mark right, and has carried it on in connection with its other business, which consists in the manufacture of medicinal preparations, and their distribution and sale through retail drug stores, known as 'Rexall stores,' situate in the different states of the Union, four of them being in Louisville, Ky.\n Meanwhile, about the year 1883, Theodore Rectanus, a druggist in Louisville, familiarly known as 'Rex,' employed this word as a trade-mark for a medicinal preparation known as a 'blood purifier.' He continued this use to a considerable extent in Louisville and vicinity, spending money in advertising and building up a trade, so that-- \n\n[248 U.S. 90, 95]\n\u00a0\n except for whatever effect might flow from Mrs. Regis' prior adoption of the word in Massachusetts, of which he was entirely ignorant-he was entitled to use the word as his trade-mark. In the year 1906 he sold his business, including the right to the use of the word, to respondent; and the use of the mark by him and afterwards by respondent was continuous from about the year 1883 until the filing of the bill in the year 1912\n\n\n Petitioner's first use of the word 'Rex' in connection with the sale of drugs in Louisville or vicinity was in April, 1912, when two shipments of 'Rex Dyspepsia Tablets,' aggregating 150 boxes and valued at $22.50, were sent to one of the 'Rexall' stores in that city. Shortly after this the remedy was mentioned by name in local newspaper advertisements published by those stores. In the previous September, petitioner shipped a trifling amount-5 boxes-to a drug store in Franklin, Ky., approximately 120 miles distant from Louisville. There is nothing to show that before this any customer in or near Kentucky had heard of the Regis remedy, with or without the description 'Rex,' or that this word ever possessed any meaning to the purchasing public in that state, except as pointing to Rectanus and the Rectanus Company and their 'blood purifier.' That it did and does convey the latter meaning in Louisville and vicinity is proved without dispute. Months before petitioner's first shipment of its remedy to Kentucky, petitioner was distinctly notified (in June, 1911) by one of its Louisville distributors, that respondent was using the word 'Rex' to designate its medicinal preparations, and that such use had been commenced by Mr. Rectanus as much as 16 or 17 years before that time.\n There was nothing to sustain the allegation of unfair competition, aside from the question of trade-mark infringement. As to this, both courts found, in substance, that the use of the same mark upon different but somewhat \n\n[248 U.S. 90, 96]\n\u00a0\n related preparations was carried on by the parties and their respective predecessors contemporaneously, but in widely separated localities, during the period in question-between 25 and 30 years-in perfect good faith; neither side having any knowledge or notice of what was being done by the other. The District Court held that, because the adoption of the mark by Mrs. Regis antedated its adoption by Rectanus, petitioner's right to the exclusive use of the word in connection with medicinal preparations intended for dyspepsia and kindred diseases of the stomach and digestive organs must be sustained, but without accounting for profits or assessment of damages for unfair trade, citing McLean v. Fleming, \n96 U.S. 245\n; Menendez v. Holt, \n128 U.S. 514\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 143; Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., \n179 \nU.S. 19, 39\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 7; Saxlehner v. Siegel-Cooper Co., \n179 U.S. 42\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 16. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that in view of the fact that Rectanus had used the mark for a long period of years in entire ignorance of Mrs. Regis' remedy or of her trade-mark, had expended money in making his mark well known, and had established a considerable though local business under it in Louisville and vicinity, while on the other hand during the same long period Mrs. Regis had done nothing, either by sales agencies or by advertising, to make her medicine or its mark known outside of the New England States, saving sporadic sales in territory adjacent to those states, and had made no effort whatever to extend the trade to Kentucky, she and her successors were bound to know that, misled by their silence and inaction, others might act, as Rectanus and his successors did act, upon the assumption that the field was open, and therefore were estopped to ask for an injunction against the continued use of the mark in Louisville and vicinity by the Rectanus Company.\n The entire argument for the petitioner is summed up in the contention that whenever the first user of a trade-mark has been reasonably diligent in extending the \n\n[248 U.S. 90, 97]\n\u00a0\n territory of his trade, and as a result of such extension has in good faith come into competition with a later user of the same mark who in equal good faith has extended his trade locally before invasion of his field by the first user, so that finally it comes to pass that the rival traders are offering competitive merchandise in a common market under the same trade-mark, the later user should be enjoined at the suit of the prior adopter, even though the latter be the last to enter the competitive field and the former have already established a trade there. Its application to the case is based upon the hypothesis that the record shows that Mrs. Regis and her firm, during the entire period of limited and local trade in her medicine under the Rex mark, were making efforts to extend their trade so far as they were able to do with the means at their disposal. There is little in the record to support this hypothesis; but, waiving this, we will pass upon the principal contention.\n The asserted doctrine is based upon the fundamental error of supposing that a trade-mark right is a right in gross or at large, like a statutory copyright or a patent for an invention, to either of which, in truth, it has little or no analogy. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 322; McLean v. Fleming, \n96 U.S. 245\n, 254. There is no such thing as property in a trade-mark except as a right appurtenant to an established business or trade in connection with which the mark is employed. The law of trade-marks is but a part of the broader law of unfair competition; the right to a particular mark grows out of its use, not its mere adoption; its function is simply to designate the goods as the product of a particular trader and to protect his good will against the sale of another's product as his; and it is not the subject of property except in connection with an existing business. Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, \n240 U.S. 403\n, 412-414, 36 Sup. Ct. 357.\n The owner of a trade-mark may not, like the proprietor \n\n[248 U.S. 90, 98]\n\u00a0\n of a patented invention, make a negative and merely prohibitive use of it as a monopoly. See United States v. Bell Telephone Co., \n167 \nU.S. 224, 250\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 809; Bement v. National Harrow Co., \n186 \nU.S. 70, 90\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 747; Paper Bag Patent Case, \n210 \nU.S. 405, 424\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 748.\n In truth, a trade-mark confers no monopoly whatever in a proper sense, but is merely a convenient means for facilitating the protection of one's good-will in trade by placing a distinguishing mark or symbol-a commercial signature-upon the merchandise or the package in which it is sold.\n It results that the adoption of a trade-mark does not, at least in the absence of some valid legislation enacted for the purpose, project the right of protection in advance of the extension of the trade, or operate as a claim of territorial rights over areas into which it thereafter may be deemed desirable to extend the trade. And the expression, sometimes met with, that a trade-mark right is not limited in its enjoyment by territorial bounds, is true only in the sense that wherever the trade goes, attended by the use of the mark, the right of the trader to be protected against the sale by others of their wares in the place of his wares will be sustained.\n Property in trade-marks and the right to their exclusive use rest upon the laws of the several states, and depend upon them for security and protection; the power of Congress to legislate on the subject being only such as arises from the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes. Trade- Mark Cases, \n100 U.S. 82\n, 93.\n Conceding everything that is claimed in behalf of the petitioner, the entire business conducted by Mrs. Regis and her firm prior to April, 1911, when petitioner acquired it, was confined to the New England States, with inconsiderable sales in New York, New Jersey, Canada, and Nova Scotia. There was nothing in all of this to give her \n\n[248 U.S. 90, 99]\n\u00a0\n any rights in Kentucky, where the principles of the common law obtain. Hunt v. Warnicke's Heirs, 3 Ky. (Hardin) 61, 62; Lathrop v. Commercial Bank, 38 Ky. (8 Dana) 114, 121, 33 Am. Dec. 481; Ray v. Sweeney, 77 Ky. ( 14 Bush) 1, 9, 29 Am. Rep. 388; AEtna Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 106 Ky. 864, 881, 51 S. W. 624, 45 L. R. A. 355; Nider v. Commonwealth, 140 Ky. 684, 687, 131 S. W. 1024, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 1246. We are referred to no decision by the courts of that state, and have found none that lays down any peculiar doctrine upon the subject of trade-mark law. There is some meager legislation, but none that affects this case (Kentucky Stats.  2572c, subsec. 7; sections 4749-4755). There was nothing to prevent the state of Kentucky (saving, of course, what Congress might do within the range of its authority) from conferring affirmative rights upon Rectanus, exclusive in that commonwealth as against others whose use of the trade- mark there began at a later time than his; but whether he had such rights, or respondent now has them, is a question not presented by the record; there being no prayer for an injunction to restrain petitioner from using the mark in the competitive field.\n It is not contended, nor is there ground for the contention, that registration of the Regis trade-mark under either the Massachusetts statute or the act of Congress, or both, had the effect of enlarging the rights of Mrs. Regis or of petitioner beyond what they would be under common-law principles. Manifestly the Massachusetts statute (Acts 1985, p. 519, c. 462) could have no extraterritorial effect. And the Act of Congress of March 3, 1881 (21 Stat. 502, c. 138), applied only to commerce with foreign nations or the Indian tribes, with either of which this case has nothing to do. See Ryder v. Holt, \n128 U.S. 525\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 145. Nor is there any provision making registration equivalent to notice of rights claimed thereunder. The Act of February 20, 1905 (33 Stat. 724, c. 592 [Comp. St. 1916,  9485 et seq.]), which took the place of the 1881 act, while extending protection to trade-marks used in interstate commerce, does not enlarge \n\n[248 U.S. 90, 100]\n\u00a0\n the effect of previous registrations, unless renewed under the provisions of its twelfth section, which has not been done in this case; hence we need not consider whether anything in this act would aid the petitioner's case.\n Undoubtedly, the general rule is that, as between conflicting claimants to the right to use the same mark, priority of appropriation determines the question. See Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 323; McLean v. Fleming, \n96 U.S. 245\n, 251; Manufacturing Co. v. Trainer, \n101 U.S. 51\n, 53; Columbia Mill Co. v. Alcorn, \n150 \nU.S. 460, 463\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 151. But the reason is that purchasers have come to understand the mark as indicating the origin of the wares, so that its use by a second producer amounts to an attempt to sell his goods as those of his competitor. The reason for the rule does not extend to a case where the same trade-mark happens to be employed simultaneously by two manufacturers in different markets separate and remote from each other, so that the mark means one thing in one market, an entirely different thing in another. It would be a perversion of the rule of priority to give it such an application in our broadly extended country that an innocent party who had in good faith employed a trade-mark in one state, and by the use of it had built up a trade there, being the first appropriator in that jurisdiction, might afterwards be prevented from using it, with consequent injury to his trade and good will, at the instance of one who theretofore had employed the same mark, but only in other and remote jurisdictions, upon the ground that its first employment happened to antedate that of the first-mentioned trader.\n In several cases federal courts have held that a prior use of a trade- mark in a foreign country did not entitle its owner to claim exclusive trade-mark rights in the United States as against one who in good faith had adopted a like trade-mark here prior to the entry of the foreigner into this market. Richter \n\n[248 U.S. 90, 101]\n\u00a0\n v. Anchor Remedy Co. (C. C.) 52 Fed. 455, 458; Richter v. Reynolds, 59 Fed. 577, 579, 8 C. C. A. 220; Walter Baker & Co. v. Delapenha (C. C.) 160 Fed. 746, 748; Gorham Mfg. Co. v. Weintraub (D. C.) 196 Fed. 957, 961.\n The same point was involved in Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, \n240 \nU.S. 403, 415\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 357, 361 (60 L. Ed. 713), where we said:\n'In the ordinary case of parties competing under the same mark in the same market, it is correct to say that prior appropriation settles the question. But where two parties independently are employing the same mark upon goods of the same class, but in separate markets wholly remote the one from the other, the question of prior appropriation is legally insignificant, unless at least it appear that the second adopter has selected the mark with some design inimical to the interests of the first user, such as to take the benefit of the reputation of his goods, to forestall the extension of his trade, or the like.'\n\n In this case, as already remarked, there is no suggestion of a sinister purpose on the part of Rectanus or the Rectanus Company; hence the passage quoted correctly defines the status of the parties prior to the time when they came into competition in the Kentucky market. And it results, as a necessary inference from what we have said, that petitioner, being the newcomer in that market, must enter it subject to whatever rights had previously been acquired there in good faith by the Rectanus Company and its predecessor. To hold otherwise-to require Rectanus to retire from the field upon the entry of Mrs. Regis' successor-would be to establish the right of the latter as a right in gross, and to extend it to territory wholly remote from the furthest reach of the trade to which it was annexed, with the effect not merely of depriving Rectanus of the benefit of the good will resulting from his long-continued use of the mark in Louisville and vicinity, and his substantial expenditures in building up his trade, but of enabling petitioner to reap substantial benefit from the publicity that Rectanus \n\n[248 U.S. 90, 102]\n\u00a0\n has thus given to the mark in that locality, and of confusing if not misleading the public as to the origin of goods thereafter sold in Louisville under the Rex mark, for, in that market, until petitioner entered it, 'Rex' meant the Rectanus product, not that of Regis.\n In support of its contention petitioner cites the same cases that were relied upon by the District Court, namely, McLean v. Fleming, \n96 U.S. 245\n; Menendez v. Holt, \n128 U.S. 514\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 143; Saxlehner v. Eisner & Mendelson Co., \n179 \nU.S. 19, 39\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 7; and Saxlehner v. Siegel-Cooper Co., \n179 U.S. 42\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 16. They exemplify the rule that, where the proof of infringement is clear, a court of equity will not ordinarily refuse an injunction for the future protection of the proprietor of a trade-mark right, even where his acquiescence and laches have been such as to disentitle him to an accounting for the past profits of the infringer. The rule finds appropriate application in cases of conscious infringement or fraudulent imitation, as is apparent from a reading of the opinions in those cases; but it has no pertinency to such a state of facts as we are now dealing with. In McLean v. Fleming, the only question raised in this court that affected the right of the appellee to an injunction was whether the Circuit Court had erred in finding that defendant's labels 'Dr. McLean's Universal Pills,' etc., infringed complainant's label 'Dr. C. McLane's Celebrated Liver Pills,' and this turned upon whether the similarity was sufficient to deceive ordinarily careful purchasers. The evidence showed without dispute that from the beginning of his use of the offending labels the defendant (McLean) had known of the McLane liver pills, and raised at least a serious question whether he did not adopt his labels for the purpose of palming off his goods as those of complainant. What he controverted was that his labels amounted to an infringement of complainant's, and when this was decided against him the propriety of the injunction was clear. In Menendez v. \n\n[248 U.S. 90, 103]\n\u00a0\n Holt, likewise, defendants (Menendez) admitted the existence of the brand in question-the words 'La Favorita' as applied to flour-and admitted using it, but denied that Holt & Co. were the owners, alleging that one Rider was a former member of that firm and entitled to use the brand, and that under him defendants had sold their flour branded 'La Favorita, S. O. Rider,' There was However, no question but that defendants adopted the brand knowing it to be already in use by others. In the Saxlehner Cases, the facts were peculiar, and need not be rehearsed; injunctions were allowed to restrain the sale of certain waters in bottles and under labels in which those of complainant were intentionally imitated. In all four cases the distinguishing features of the present case were absent.\n Here the essential facts are so closely parallel to those that furnished the basis of decision in the Allen & Wheeler Case, reported sub nom. Hanover Milling Co. v. Metcalf, \n240 U.S. 403\n, 419-420, 39 Sup. Ct. 357, as to render further discussion unnecessary. Mrs. Regis and her firm, having during a long period of years confined their use of the 'Rex' mark to a limited territory wholly remote from that in controversy, must be held to have taken the risk that some innocent party might in the meantime hit upon the same mark, apply it to goods of similar character, and expend money and effort in building up a trade under it; and since it appears that Rectanus in good faith, and without notice of any prior use by others, selected and used the 'Rex' mark, and by the expenditure of money and effort succeeded in building up a local but valuable trade under it in Louisville and vicinity before petitioner entered that field, so that 'Rex' had come to be recognized there as the 'trade signature' of Rectanus and of respondent as his successor, petitioner is estopped to set up their continued use of the mark in that territory as an infringement of the Regis trade-mark. Whatever confusion may have \n\n[248 U.S. 90, 104]\n\u00a0\n arisen from conflicting use of the mark is attributable to petitioner's entry into the field with notice of the situation; and petitioner cannot complain of this. As already stated, respondent is not complaining of it.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","188":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVAN DYKE v. ARIZONA EASTERN R.

W. 1\/4 of the S. E. 1\/4, Sec. 30, T. 1 N., R. 15 E., Gila County Arizona.\n The trial court made findings of fact which were concurred in by the Supreme Court. 18 Ariz. 220, 157 Pac. 1019. And we see no reason for not accepting them, notwithstanding plaintiffs in error urge a review of them. They are as follows:\n The railroad, as the successor of the Gila Valley Globe & Northern Railway Company, acquired its rights, including rights of way and all other assets. In March, 1906, the latter company platted a line of railroad from Globe to Miami, Arizona, about nine miles in length, passing over and across certain public land, and, November 5, 1908, filed in the local land office its map or profile of definite location as provided by the Act of Congress of March 3, 1875. Prior to that time the land covered by the map as well as the land in dispute was thrown into the Crook National Forest Reserve. April 16, 1909, written application to the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, with map of right of way attached, was made by the railroad to enter and extend its line across a portion of the forest reserve. The railroad was given permission on July 6, 1909, to enter the reservation and to locate and construct its road therein. The map and profile of its road was approved September 21, 1909, by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with the act of Congress.\n In April, 1909, the Globe Company commenced the construction of its road and completed it in September of that year, and it and the appellee company have operated trains ever since October, 1909. Before construction was commenced, to wit, in November and December, 1908, \n\n[248 U.S. 49, 51]\n\u00a0\n the Globe Company amended its line of survey and changed the course of its road upon and across the land in dispute and along its entire length to the extent of 100 feet in width on each side of the center line of its railroad and constructed its road on the amended location conforming on the ground to the staked and marked line.\n At the time of the amended location the land was held by the Miami Land & Improvement Company, a corporation, as mineral land and the Globe Company accepted a deed from it to a right of way across the land. By executive order the land in dispute was restored to the public domain December 22, 1909, on which date appellant, Cleve Van Dyke, filed upon the same under the homestead law. He had theretofore accepted it under an option to purchase as a mineral location from the Miami Improvement Company. On that date he went off the land, but immediately returned and established his residence with a view to homesteading. In due course he made final proof and on February 12, 1912, a patent without any reservation was issued to him for his homestead.\n December 30, 1909, the Globe Company filed its amended map and profile of its right of way in the local land office which was regularly and duly approved March 4, 1911\n\n\n Van Dyke attempted to show that he had established residence upon the land prior to December 22, 1909, the date upon which he filed his homestead entry. But it is clear that he did not go upon the land prior to its inclusion in the Forest Reserve. He was upon the land under the option to purchase mentioned and he attempted to show that he was there under a verbal permit from the Forest Supervisor with the intention of entering the land as a homestead and that he made application to the Forestry Department for an examination and listing thereof under the Act of June 11, 1906; application, however, was rejected. \n\n[248 U.S. 49, 52]\n\u00a0\n That he did not rely upon the settlement prior to December 22, 1909, is clearly shown by his testimony. He said:\n'It is a fact that about midnight on the 22d of December, 1909, I took up residence in the house testified to. That is, I went off the ground and back on again at midnight.'\n\n December 22d was the first time the land could have been settled upon without permission from the national government, and this permission he did not obtain.\n Upon these facts the Supreme Court said certain contentions arose: (1) It is that of the railroad that its rights were fixed and established in August and September, 1909, when it completed the construction of its railroad. (2) Opposing, plaintiffs in error assert that because the railroad changed its route as located by its original map and profile approved by the Secretary of the Interior it acquired no rights until it filed with the local land office on December 30, 1909, its amended map of location, which was too late; Van Dyke having taken the land as a homestead December 22, 1909. And to the contention of the company that if the land was public it was not bound to follow the line as shown on its map and profile, plaintiffs in error reply that the land had ceased to be public land by being thrown into the National Forest Reserve and that the railroad was hence restricted to the specific right of way shown on its approved map and profile; or, if changed to another and different route, the consent of the Interior Department was necessary and that such permission had not been given and hence the railroad acquired no rights, at least against plaintiffs in error. It is conceded, however, that the railroad company was entitled to a right of way to the extent of 50 feet on each side of the conter of its line of track acquired by deed from the Miami Land & Improvement Company, in the execution of which deed Van Dyke 'acquiesced.' Therefore, as said by the Supreme Court:\n'Fifty feet on each side of \n\n[248 U.S. 49, 53]\n\u00a0\n the center line of the track, or one hundred feet of the right of way, are not involved in this suit. The area in question being the excess of one hundred feet up to two hundred feet, amounting to 2.23 acres.'\n\n We have had occasion to consider the Act of March 3, 1875, c. 152, 18 Stat. 482 (Comp. St. 1916,  4921-4926), and what constituted a definite location of the right of way under it, and have decided that such event occurs by the actual construction of the road. Jamestown & Northern Railroad Co. v. Jones, \n177 U.S. 125\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 568; Minneapolis, etc., Ry. Co. v. Doughty, \n208 U.S. 251\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 291; Stalker v. Oregon Short Line, \n225 U.S. 142\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 636.\n It was found by the courts below that the construction of the railroad was commenced in April, 1909, and completed Suptember, 1909, and that trains have been operated on it ever since. This satisfies the condition expressed in the cited cases of the appropriation of a right of way. But it is objected that the land was not then subject to appropriation, being within a Forest Reserve. In reply the Act of Congress of March 3, 1899, c. 427, 30 Stat. 1233 (Comp. St. 1916,  4945), is adduced. It reads as follows:\n'That in the form provided by existing law the Secretary of the Interior may file and approve surveys and plats of any right of way for a wagon road, railroad, or other highway over and across any forest reservation or reservoir site when in his judgment the public interests will not be injuriously affected thereby.'\n\n Of this act we said, in Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. v. United States, \n244 \nU.S. 351, 357\n, 358 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 625, that it commits to the Secretary of the Interior the question of determining whether the public will be injuriously affected by the grant of a right of way to a railroad through a forest reserve and authorizes him to file and approve surveys and plats of the right of way. The measure of his discretion is large and only through his approval can a right of way be acquired.\n The condition was satisfied in this case. The Globe Company-to the rights of which defendant in error \n\n[248 U.S. 49, 54]\n\u00a0\n succeeded-in 1906, in preparation for the construction of its road, platted its road and filed in the local land office its map and profile of definite location under the Act of 1875, in November, 1908. Several months prior to the latter date the land of the platted line and the land in dispute were thrown into the Crook National Forest Reserve. In the following year the railroad company made application to the Commissioner of the General Land Office for permission to enter the reserve and to locate and construct its road thereon. And the application was communicated to the Department of Agriculture and approved by the Acting District Forester; the permission was granted and the map and profile of the road was approved September 21, 1909, by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Act of Congress of March 3, 1875. The road was constructed, and, as we have said, completed in September, 1909, and put in operation in October. And these successive steps were before the date on which Van Dyke attempted to initiate a homestead right. The discretion of the Secretary of the Interior was therefore exercised, and we agree with the Supreme Court that we cannot infer a rule of the Department which precluded the granting of permission upon the original map and profile.\n Plaintiffs in error contend that the railroad company had no power to construct a road from Globe to Miami, Arizona, because its charter failed to designate such a line as within the project for which it was incorporated. This was made an issue by the pleadings and the court found against it. Besides, it is not within the province of plaintiffs in error to make the objection; it was a matter for the Secretary of the Interior to determine. And, again, plaintiffs in error have not such relation to the railroad company as to complain of the exercise of power outside of its charter.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","189":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWAITE v. MACY(1918)\nNo. 255\nArgued: March 28, 1918Decided: April 22, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[246 U.S. 606, 607]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Warren, for appellants.\n Mr. Joseph H. Choate, J., of New York City, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill brought by importers of tea to prevent the appellants, a board of general appraisers known as the Tea Board, from applying to tea imported by the plaintiffs tests which, it is alleged, are illegal and if applied will lead to the exclusion of the tea. The bill was dismissed by the District Court, 215 Fed. 456, but the decree was reversed and an injunction ordered by he Circuit Court of Appeals, 224 Fed. 359, 140 C. C. A. 45.\n The case is within a narrow compass. The Act of March 2, 1897, c. 358, 29 Stat. 604, amended by the Act of May 16, 1908, c. 170, 35 Stat. 163, provides for the establishment of standards 'of purity, quality, and fitness for consumption, of all kinds of teas imported,' etc.,  3 (Comp. St. 1916,  8788), and makes it 'unlawful ... to import any merchandise as tea which is inferior in purity, quality and fitness for consumption to the standards' referred to. Section 1 (section 8786). When the tea is entered at the custom house it is compared with the standards by an examiner and if found equal to them in the above particulars it may be released by the custom house; if found inferior it is to be retained. Section 5 (section 8790). But either side may protest and have the matter referred to a board of three general appraisers such as the appellants are. If upon a final re-examination by the board 'the \n\n[246 U.S. 606, 608]\n\u00a0\n tea shall be found inferior in purity, quality and fitness for consumption to the said standards' the tea must be removed from the country within six months. Section 6 (section 8791). The tea is to be tested in the particulars mentioned 'according to the usages and customs of the tea trade; including the testing of an infusion of the same in boiling water, and, if necessary, chemical analysis.' Section 7 (section 8792). The Secretary of the Treasury is given power to enforce the provisions of the act by appropriate regulations. Section 10 (section 8795). A regulation has adopted a test for the discovery of artificial coloring matter which in brief consists in rubbing tea leaves reduced to dust upon semi-glazed paper with a spatula and examining the smear with a lens. If particles of coloring matter are found a test sheet is submitted to chemical analysis for identification of the coloring matter and as soon as it is identified the tea is to be rejected. It was said below to be undisputed that if the tea in question contains any coloring matter, whether present through design or accident, the appellants pursuing the regulation will keep it out. The standard samples of this tea contain no coloring matter but contain a far greater amount of other foreign substances than does this. This tea is worth nearly four times as much a pound as the standard and the sole cause for rejecting it is the presence of from nine to nineteen parts of Prussian blue in a million of elements otherwise not objected to. It is not contended that the Prussian blue is deleterious. These facts are found by both Courts below. Upon them the plaintiffs (the appellees) say that the Government is attempting to apply criteria not allowed by the law. The Government says that the bill is an attempt to control a board in the performance of its statutory duty and to substitute the judgment of a court for that of the board.\n No doubt it is true that this Court cannot displace the judgment of the board in any matter within its jurisdiction, but it is equally true that the board cannot en- \n\n[246 U.S. 606, 609]\n\u00a0\n large the powers given to it by statute and cover a usurpation by calling it a decision on purity, quality or fitness for consumption. Morrill v. Jones, \n106 U.S. 466\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 423. United States v. United Verde Copper Co., \n196 \nU.S. 207, 215\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 222. United States v. George, \n228 \nU.S. 14, 21\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 412. Again, it is true that Courts will not issue injunctions against administrative officers on the mere apprehension that they will not do their duty or will not follow the law. First National Bank of Albuquerque v. Albright, \n208 U.S. 548\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 349. But in this case the superior of the appellants had promulgated a rule for them to follow which is alleged to be beyond the power of the Secretary to make. It is said that the appellants are independent of the Secretary and that it is to be presumed that they will decide according to law, as they say in their answer. But if the avoidance of a direc statement as to their intent did not of itself warrant a presumption that they would obey orders, the admissions of their counsel were enough to make their intent to do so plain.\n We are brought then to the merits, and we are of opinion that the rule cannot be sustained, notwithstanding that since a former board refused to follow it as it then stood, there have been added clauses intended to save it as a chemical analysis. The regulation makes the presence of any coloring matter an absolute ground for exclusion. But the only grounds recognized by the statute are inferiority to the standard in purity, quality and fitness for consumption, words repeated over and over again in the act. It cannot be made a rule of law that any tea that has an infinitesimal amount of innocuous coloring matter is inferior in those respects to a standard that has a much greater amount of other impurities and is worth only a quarter as much. All extraneous substances are impurities, and the presence of any may be detected in any way found efficient. But one such substance cannot be picked out and accorded supremacy in evil by an absolute \n\n[246 U.S. 606, 610]\n\u00a0\n rule irrespective of any harm that it may do. We go one step further and add that in view of the facts as to the standard and this tea, the presence of the Prussian blue affords no adequate ground for keeping the tea out.\n The Secretary and the board must keep within the statute, Merritt v. Welsh, \n104 U.S. 694\n, which goes to their jurisdiction, see Interstate Commerce Commission v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., \n216 \nU.S. 538, 544\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 417, and we see no reason why the restrictions should not be enforced by injunction, as it was, for instance, in Bacon v. Rutland R. R. Co., \n232 U.S. 134\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 283. Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605, 620\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 340. Santa Fe Pacific R. R. Co. v. Lane, \n244 U.S. 492\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 714. We are satisfied that no other remedy, if there is any other, will secure the plaintiff's rights.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","190":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALLER v. TEXAS & P R. CO.(1918)\nNo. 92\nArgued: December 17, 1917Decided: January 7, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 398, 399]\n\u00a0\n Suit to compel payment of 30 bonds issued by the New Orleans, Baton Rouge & Vicksburg Railroad Company under the circumstances hereinafter detailed. It was originally brought against appellee and the New Orleans Pacific Railroad Company and the Union Trust Company of New York. The latter company was dismissed from the suit. No process was issued against the New Orleans Pacific Railroad Company.\n The bill presents the jurisdictional qualification of the parties and the following facts, which we state narratively:\n The New Orleans, Baton Rouge & Vicksburg Railroad Company, which we shall refer to as the Baton Rouge Company, was incorporated December 30, 1869, by a special act of the Louisiana Legislature and was given the usual powers to execute the purpose of its incorporation, to borrow money and issue bonds, etc., and secure their payment by a mortgage of its stock and franchises and property which it then owned or might thereafter acquire.\n The Texas & Pacific Railway Company, herein referred to as the Texas & Pacific Company, was incorporated March 3, 1871, by an act of Congress ( Act March 3, 1871, c. 122, 16 Stat. 573), and was granted certain lands to aid in the construction of its road, and by a section of the act (section 22) a grant was made to the Baton Rouge Company of the \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 400]\n\u00a0\n same kind, that is, alternate sections of public lands per mile, in the state of Louisiana, upon the condition that the company complete the whole of the road within five years of the passage of the act, the lands to be selected on each side of its road on a route to be selected by the company to connect with the Texas Pacific at the eastern terminus of the latter through the public land from New Orleans to Baton Rouge and thence by the way of Alexandria. The company was empowered to mortgage the lands.\n September 4, 1872, it exercised the power and executed a mortgage or deed of trust to the Union Trust Company of New York, transferring and conveying, among other things, all of its railroad and personal property and all the right, title, and interest it then had or it or its successors might acquire to the granted lands. The trust company accepted of record its trusteeship.\n The mortgage was intended to secure 12,000 bonds of $1,000 each, payable September 1, 1902, with interest at 7 per cent. payable semiannually. 1,250 of the bonds were issued and certified by the trustee.\n Complainants, as executors and trustees of the estate under the will of David J. Waller, who died in 1893, are the owners and holders before maturity of 30 of the bonds with 52 coupons attached thereto.\n It was covenanted in the mortgage by the trustee thereof that a sinking fund should be established and maintained and an amount equal to 1 per cent. of the company's gross earnings, after certain deductions, and the proceeds of the sales of the granted lands should be paid to the trustee for the fund for the benefit of the bondholders. The mortgage was duly recorded.\n The railroad company accepted the grant and filed a map of its general route from Baton Rouge to Shreveport and a like map showing the general route from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. The lands were then withdrawn \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 401]\n\u00a0\n from entry and sale by the order of the Secretary of the Interior. And under the terms of the grant the lands vested in the company, subject only to the construction of the road.\n January 5, 1881, the Baton Rouge Company, by deed of quitclaim, conveyed the lands to the New Orleans Pacific Railroad Company, referred to herein as the New Orleans Company, and its successors and assigns, and thereafter the Baton Rouge Company no longer maintained its separate corporate existence and became merged and consolidated with the New Orleans Company.\n The conveyance and acceptance were filed by the New Orleans Company in the Interior Department, and the Secretary of the Interior, under an opinion of the Attorney General of the United States, recognized the New Orleans Company and that the Baton Rouge Company had title to the lands and could sell and assign the same.\n On March 13, 1883, the Secretary of the Interior transmitted to the President a report of the examination of 260 miles of the road and recommended that they be accepted and that patents be issued for such lands as might have been earned by their construction by the New Orleans Company, as assignee of the Baton Rouge Company, the mortgagor thereof. The recommendation was approved and patents were issued to the New Orleans Company, but solely as the assignee of the Baton Rouge Company and as its grantee for 679,284.64 acres of lands in Louisiana. The foregoing state of facts in respect to the title of the lands were determined and adjudged in New Orleans Pacific Railway Co. v. United States, \n124 U.S. 124\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 417.\n By an act of Congress of February 8, 1887, all lands which were not forfeited thereby were relinquished, granted, conveyed, and confirmed to the New Orleans Company as assignee or Baton Rouge Company by the transfer above stated, and title confirmed to \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 402]\n\u00a0\n approximately 746,954 acres within the grant to the Baton Rouge Company. At this time the New Orleans Company was and now is consolidated with and merged into the Texas & Pacific Company.\n Within six months after the conveyance to it by the Baton Rouge Company the New Orleans Company transferred all of its property to the Texas & Pacific Company, with the object and intention to merge the former with the latter under the latter's name. The land grant acquired by the former company was expressly reserved and its corporate recognition was to be continued and maintained until further authorized corporate action. In addition to the lands patented to the amount of 679,284.64 acres to the New Orleans Company as assignee of the Baton Rouge Company other lands have been patented to it amounting in 1917 to 1,001,000 acres, and the New Orleans Company has since procured further patents and filed applications for additional lands and still continues to do so. The records of the Secretary of the Interior show that there is a balance still due of more than 1,000,000 acres.\n By the act incorporating the Texas & Pacific Company (1871) it was provided that the property and franchises acquired from each of the consolidated or purchased railroad company or companies should vest and become absolutely the property of the Texas & Pacific Company, subject, however, to all of the debts and obligations of the acquired company or companies, and that the consolidation should not impair any lien which might exist on any railroads so consolidated. It was provided that there should be no consolidation with any competing road and that the contracts and obligations of railroads consolidated should be liens upon the Texas & Pacific Company.\n From about the time of the recognition of the New Orleans Company the Texas & Pacific Company con- \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 403]\n\u00a0\n trolled it and still controls it and by the recited acts and transfers became charged with the lien of the mortgage by Baton Rouge Company to the Union Trust Company (September 4, 1872) and the other obligations of the New Orleans Company, particularly the performance of the covenants in the mortgage and the payment of the bonds secured thereby. The recognition of the companies and merger in the Texas & Pacific Company and transfer of the lands granted were all a part of a scheme to secure from the United States the grant for the purpose of raising money thereon by mortgages and bonds secured thereby to construct and equip a transcontinental railway from New Orleans to the Pacific, as appears from the act incorporating the Texas & Pacific Company (Act March 3, 1871).\n The lands patented in the name of the New Orleans Company were appropriated by the Texas & Pacific Company, it continuing the other company in name for the sole purpose of receiving patents, and controlling its corporate books, accounts and records, the New Orleans Company maintaining no corporate existence and having no officers or directors ( this on information and belief), and the Texas & Pacific, in violation of the terms of the covenants of the mortgage by the Baton Rouge Company to the Union Trust Company and the trust thereby created, has diverted the proceeds of the lands granted from the use and purpose of the mortgage and in fraud of complainants and the holders of bonds secured by the mortgage to its own use and to the use of the New Orleans Company and to other uses not authorized by the deed of trust. The persons to whom the sales of the lands have been made are so many that it is wholly impracticable to enforce the lien of the mortgage and who have by occupation under the color of title acquired an impregnable title thereto.\n The Union Trust Company and certain bondholders \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 404]\n\u00a0\n were made parties defendant in an action brought against the Baton Rouge Company by the trustees under deeds of trust of April 17, 1883, and January 5, 1884, executed by the New Orleans Company, to declare them first liens upon the lands described therein and to secure an issue of bonds authorized thereby and asked for judgment that the deed of trust from the Baton Rouge Company to the Union Trust Company (September 4, 1872) did not affect or give any lien in or to the lands and that the same be canceled. A decree pro confesso was entered so declaring and adjudging.\n The bondholders were dismissed from the case. The attorneys for the complainants were attorneys for the New Orleans Company and the Union Trust Company. There were false allegations in the bill, an the Union Trust Company, though in duty bound as trustee to defend the action and the trust created by the mortgage, failed to do so, permitted the destruction of the lien and permitted the New Orleans Company and the Texas & Pacific Company to appropriate to themselves or to other purposes the proceeds of the sales of the lands which were at least worth $5 per acre.\n The subject-matter of the suit exceeds $3,000 and the complainants are without remedy at law.\n Discovery is prayed of the quantity of lands patented, the amount of sales and the proceeds thereof and that the Union Trust Company and the Texas & Pacific Company account to complainants and to all other bondholders similarly situated for all money and property received from the enjoyment and sales of the lands to the extent of their bonds and coupons and that they be adjudged to pay complainants the amounts found due them.\n The answer of the Texas & Pacific Company qualified or denied certain of the averments of the bill and admitted others. It set up the various acts of Congress referred to in the bill and the transactions between the Texas & \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 405]\n\u00a0\n Pacific Company and the New Orleans Company, but assigned a different cause and effect to them and to the acts of Congress and to what was done under them. Its defenses may be concentrated in four propositions stated by counsel:\n'(1) That the Baton Rouge Company never acquired title to the land grant lands, and that its alleged mortgage of September 4, 1872, never became operative as a lien thereon.\n\n'(2) That prosecution of the action is barred by the decree of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana in the suit of Dillon and Alexander against the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company and others.\n\n'(3) That the Texas & Pacific Railway Company is in no way connected with the land grant or the transactions referred to in the complaint.\n\n'(4) That the suit is barred by limitations and by the laches of the complainants.'\n\n Upon the issues thus formed, if it can be said there are issues upon anything else but the characterization and legal effect of the acts of Congress, the instruments referred to and the transactions detailed, the District Court expressed opinion that it was unable 'to see how any express trust ever existed in plaintiff's favor or in favor of his decedent except that created by the mortgage to the Union Trust Company as trustee, the bounds and limitations of which are set forth in the deed itself,' which instrument, the court said, was 'in effect nothing more or less than a mortgage and to be treated as such.' The mortgage and debt, therefore, the court said, might be enforced against the property at the situs of the latter, but by this suit, the court said further, it was sought to enforce the collection of the debt, not from the property mortgaged, but from another corporation now alleged to be personally liable for it. Such liability, the court \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 406]\n\u00a0\n continued, could only result from some trust ex delicto to be implied from some state of fact shown, and not upon any direct undertaking by the New Orleans Company or the Texas & Pacific Company to pay the debt of another, to wit, the Baton Rouge Company. Therefore, the court concluded that its decision must turn upon either one or both of the affirmative defenses made by the Texas & Pacific Company, that is, either the statute of limitations or laches or both.\n Reciting that the bonds matured September 4, 1902, and this suit was commenced May 7, 1913, the court finally applied the statute of limitations of 10 years according to the law of New York and Louisiana. It, however, expressed the view that the defense of laches should be sustained and referred to O'Brien v. Wheelock, \n184 U.S. 493\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 354, and dismissed the bill.\n The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court, but rested its decision upon the defense of laches, citing therefor O'Brien v. Wheelock, supra, and saying:\n'The proposition is somewhat startling that the holder of the obligations of one corporation secured by a mortgage on its property may maintain a suit 40 years after the date of such obligation and based thereon against another corporation not a party thereto.'\n\n Mr. Jesse C. Adkins, of Washington, D. C. (Messrs. David Bennett King, W. Russell Osborn, William A. Milliken, all of New York City, and C. C. Calhoun and Daniel B. Henderson, both of Washington, D. C., on the briefs), for appellants.\n Mr. Thomas J. Freeman, of New Orleans, La., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, after stating the case as above delivered the opinion of the court.\n To establish a trust against the Texas & Pacific Company it is argued that the purpose of the act of Congress \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 407]\n\u00a0\n of 1871 was to provide for the construction of a transcontinental railroad from Texas to San Diego, cal., and from thence to San Francisco by another company, and that the Baton Rouge Company, the New Orleans Company and principally the Texas & Pacific Company were instruments of that purpose and the grant of the Baton Rouge Company, by its mortgage to the Union Trust Company, became charged with a lien for the payment of the bonds issued by the railroad company, which lien followed the conveyance of the lands to the New Orleans Company and to the Texas & Pacific Company, and that besides there was a personal trust first in the Union Trust Company and successively in the other companies. And the argument is attempted to be fortified by section 4 of the act of Congress of 1871, which authorized the Texas & Pacific Company to acquire other railroad corporations, and was by section 6 to become responsible for the debts or obligations of any company so acquired.\n To sustain this contention the provisions of the various instruments are adduced and their requirements, especially that the bonds were entitled to the benefit and security of a sinking fund to be set apart for their redemption whereby the proceeds of all lands granted to the railroad company (the Baton Rouge Company) were to be applied to the payment of interest on the bonds and to their redemption and also 1 per cent. of the gross earnings of the company, and that the railroad and its equipment were mortgaged for like purposes and all 'the lands and sections of land situated, lying and being on either side of the said railroad, as the same may be finally located and constructed in accordance with and as granted by the act of Congress' of March 3, 1871\n\n\n The mortgage to the Union Trust Company was in trust for the purposes expressed above and it was provided that, if default should be made in payment of inter- \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 408]\n\u00a0\n est or of any payment to the sinking fund and continue for the period of 6 months or in default of any requirement of the mortgage, all of the bonds outstanding, at the option of the holders of a majority in interest of such outstanding bonds, should forthwith become due and payable. And further, upon written request of the holders of at least 1000 bonds then out standing, the trustee should foreclose the equity of redemption of the property embraced in the hypothecation, and at the request of a bondholder might take possession of the road.\n Sales of the lands were provided for and the disposition of the proceeds, any balance remaining to be appropriated to the purpose of the sinking fund. There was a covenant by the company to pay on June 1, 1880, and on the 1st of June of each succeeding year a sum which should equal 1 per cent. of the gross earnings received by the road from its operation 12 months immediately preceding, which sum should be applied by the trust company or its successors to the redemption of the bonds, and that the trust company on the 1st days of January and July of each and every year should designate by lot for redemption a number of bonds sufficient to equal, as near as might be, the accumulations of the sinking fund and cause a notice to be printed of such purpose.\n It is contended that by reason of these provisions and the facts detailed a trust was created that followed the lands to whosesoever hands they reached and each possessor of them became a trustee and bound with respect to the property to the execution of the trust in the same manner as the original trustee, the Union Trust Company, was citing for this result Ketchum v. City of St. Louis, \n101 U.S. 306\n, 25 L. ed. 999.\n And by virtue of this principle the New Orleans Company is declared to have been a trustee and the lands granted to it subject to the execution of the trust and the Texas & Pacific Company has also become a trustee. \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 409]\n\u00a0\n Another ground of liability is asserted against the latter company. It has been consolidated, the contention is, with the New Orleans Company and the latter has disappeared from sight and significance, leaving the Texas & Pacific in sole responsibility. And yet the instrument of consolidation expressly excepts 'the lands and the land grants acquired or to be acquired' by the New Orleans Company from the United States, the state of Louisiana, or the Baton Rouge Company, or from any other source, other than lands necessary or needful for railway purposes. There is an express exemption and exclusion of such from the provisions of the instrument of consolidation. And it was provided that the corporate existence of the New Orleans Company should be maintained and its power to carry out the existing contracts and to mortgage any land grant it had acquired or might acquire from the Baton Rouge Company or otherwise should remain unimpaired.\n There is, therefore, some ground for the contention of the Texas & Pacific Company that there is a want of that privity of property which, according to the insistence of appellant, is necessary to make that company trustee of the Baton Rouge Company's mortgage of 1872, and that sections 4 and 6 of the act incorporating the Texas & Pacific Company have not the meaning ascribed to them, and further that the Baton Rouge Company never acquired any lands to which a lien could attach, and that the asserted trust had nothing upon which it could be exercised, neither lands to sell nor railroad to take possession of and operate, both of which-sale of lands and operation of road-were necessary to the execution of the trust, and that it was so determined in a suit against proper parties by the decree of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n To this contention complainants reply: (1) The decree was collusively obtained; (2) it did not cover the right \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 410]\n\u00a0\n of way and roadbed which, it is said, is admitted to have come to the Texas & Pacific Company from the New Orleans Company; (3) independently of the deed of trust and irrespective of it, the arrangement between those companies was an attempt to conserve the subordinate rights and interests of the stockholders of the Baton Rouge Company at the expense of its creditors; an attempt, it is insisted, always judicially condemned. Cases are cited, among others, N. P. Ry. Co. v. Boyd, \n228 U.S. 482\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 554.\n The argument to sustain or oppose the respective contentions we need not recite. They have indication in the pleadings and, it may be, in what we have already said. We rest our decision on the defense of laches which, we think, has been sustained.\n In 1872 the Baton Rouge Company executed the instrument the particular trusts of which are now attempted to be enforced. Before that time it had filed a map of general route but no map of definite location; but after that time the record discloses nothing done by it until 1880, when it conveyed the lands to the New Orleans Company.\n The activities of the New Orleans Company are shown and through and by what struggles it was enabled to construct the road. The record shows assertion of rights by some of the bondholders, but also shows that the assertion was met by challenge of legality and judicially determined against. During all that time, during all of the notoriety of the transactions detailed, the owner or owners of the bonds in suit made no claim by word or act and now, over 10 years after their maturity and 40 years after their issue, a claim of personal liability is made against the Texas & Pacific Company. It is to be borne in mind that the interest on the bonds has always been in default, certainly since 1876, and there was remedy provided for such default. At the instance of \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 411]\n\u00a0\n any holder of the bonds the trustee could have taken possession of the road, and, if of the Baton Rouge Road, then of its successors in liability, the New Orleans and the Texas & Pacific Companies, for if they were successors in liability they were successively subject to the remedy. If it be said that such remedy was extreme and inconvenient, it had potency as a threat in the hands of a diligent creditor, and, besides, if there was a successive personal liability, it accrued against the New Orleans Company in 1880 and the Texas & Pacific Company in 1883.\n The delay is attempted to be excused. It is said action for nonpayment of interest could only be taken by the holders of 1,000 or a majority of bonds outstanding, and that it appears the Texas & Pacific Company had acquired 1,183 of the 1,275 bonds which were outstanding. It is hence contended that complainants' testate could not have been guilty of laches before his death and that the present complainants could not act until the maturity of the bonds in 1902. It is further said that complainants filed a bill in 1908 in the United States District Court in Louisiana to collect the bonds and that until the filing of the answer in that case complainants were ignorant of the merger of the New Orleans and the Texas & Pacific companies or of the suit filed in 1890 to remove the cloud of the asserted lien of the mortgage of the Baton Rouge Company to the Union Trust Company of 1872.\n But what complainants' testate knew does not appear and whether he was an original holder or a purchaser, except that it was thought he owned the bonds for 7 or 8 years before his death. And the ignorance of complainants is extraordinary in view of their interest, if it was an attentive interest. If we may suppose ignorance of records we cannot suppose, certainly not indulge, an ignorance of the open activities of the companies and the possession and operation of the railroad by the Texas & Pacific Company. \n\n[245 U.S. 398, 412]\n\u00a0\n It is again said in excuse that it does not appear that the Texas & Pacific Company has changed its position, which it is said is the same as it was in 1881, and that it has even realized the benefit of the trust and so far executed it as to pay before 1890 most of the bonds. Why those bonds were paid or acquired and upon what motive do not appear, and it cannot be said that a company which has been in possession of and operating a great property for many years, having spent large sums of money upon it, in the belief of having a clear and unincumbered right, is inequitably unaffected by a claim against it, asserted as a result of remote transactions with which it had no connection. And certainly it may be urged that it would surprise and strain any condition to be suddenly called upon to pay $107,700, that sum being the amount of principal and interest (7 per cent.) of complainants' demand.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","191":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWATTERS v.

It may be assumed that much the greater part of his business was interstate commerce and free from any obligation that the ordinance imposed. But in the course of his business he did sell two cans of toilet cream that were at rest in the state before the sale, and it is admitted that this transaction was not protected from state legislation.

The ordinance makes it unlawful to engage in peddling any goods or to canvass from house to house for the sale of property on subscription without a license, which may be had on payment of specified fees. The plaintiff in error agrues that the application of this law should be determined by the general course of business, not by an isolated transaction, and the argument has force. It depends, however, on the construction of the ordinance, and as the State Court has construed it to apply to and forbid the act proved, the judgment must be affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","192":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWATTS, WATTS & CO. v.

McClay, Jr., all of New York City, for petitioner.[ Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca di Navigazione \n248 U.S. 9\n (1918) ]\n\n\n[248 U.S. 9, 15]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles S. Haight, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[248 U.S. 9, 19]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On August 4, 1914, Great Britain declared war against Germany and on August 12, 1914, against Austria-Hungary. Prior to August 4, Watts, Watts & Co., Limited, a British corporation, had supplied to Unione Austriaca di Navigazione, an Austro-Hungarian corporation, bunker coal at Algiers, a dependency of the French Republic. Drafts on London given therefor having been protested for nonpayment, the seller brought, on August 24, 1914, a libel in personam against the purchaser in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of New York. Jurisdiction was obtained by attaching one of the steamers to which the coal had been furnished. The attachment was discharged by giving a bond which is now in force. The respondent appeared and filed an answer which admitted that the case was within the admiralty jurisdiction of the court; and it was submitted for decision upon a stipulation as to facts and proof of foreign law.\n The respondent contended that the District Court, as a court of a neutral nation, should not exercise its juris dictional \n\n[248 U.S. 9, 20]\n\u00a0\n power between alien belligerents to require the transfer, by process of judgment and execution, of funds by one alien belligerent to another; an act which it alleged was prohibited alike by the municipal law of both belligerents. The libelant replied that performance of the contract by respondent-that is, the payment of a debt due-was legal by the law of the place of performance, whether that place be taken to be Algiers or London; that it was immaterial whether it was legal by the Austro-Hungarian law, since Austria-Hungary was not the place of performance; and that the enforcement of legal rights here would not infringe the attitude of impartiality which underlies neutrality. The District Court held that it had jurisdiction of the controversy, and that it was within its discretion to determine whether it should exercise the jurisdiction; since both parties were aliens and the cause of action arose and was to be performed abroad. It then dismissed the libel without prejudice, saying:\n'From the standpoint of this neutral jurisdiction the controlling consideration is that the law of both belligerent countries [Great Britain and Austria-Hungary] forbids a payment by one belligerent subject to his enemy during the continuance of war. This court, in the exercise of jurisdiction founded on comity, may not ignore that state of war and disregard the consequences resulting from it.' 224 Fed. 188, 194.\n\n The dismissal by the District Court was entered on May 27, 1915. On December 14, 1915, the decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, on the ground that it was within the discretion of the trial court to determine whether to take or to decline jurisdiction (The Belgenland, \n114 U.S. 355\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 860), and that the exercise of this discretion should not be interfered with, since no abuse was shown (229 Fed. 136, 143 C. C. A. 412). On June 12, 1916, an application for leave to file a petition for writ of mandamus to compel the Court of Appeals to review the \n\n[248 U.S. 9, 21]\n\u00a0\n exercise of discretion by the District Court was denied (Ex parte Watts, Watts & Co., \n241 U.S. 655\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 726), and a writ of certiorari was granted by this court (\n241 U.S. 677\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 726). The certiorari and return were filed July 21, 1916. On December 7, 1917, the President issued a proclamation declaring that a state of war exists between the United States and Austria-Hungary. The case was argued here on April 17, 1918\n\n\n This court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, has power not only to correct error in the judgment entered below, but to make such disposition of the case as justice may at this time require.

Then, as earlier, the proceeding was one between alien belligerents in a court of a neutral nation. Now, it is a suit by one belligerent in a court of a cobelligerent against a common enemy. A suit may be brought in our courts against an alien enemy. McVeigh v. United States, 11 Wall. 259, 267. See also Dorsey v. Kyle, 30 Md. 512, 96 Am. Dec. 617. If the libel had been filed under existing circumstances, security for \n\n[248 U.S. 9, 22]\n\u00a0\n the claim being obtained by attachment, probably no American court would, in the exercise of discretion, dismiss it and thus deprive the libelant not only of its security, but perhaps of all possibility of ever obtaining satisfaction. Under existing circumstances dismissal of the libel is not consistent with the demands of justice.\n The respondent, although an alien enemy, is, of course, entitled to defend before a judgment should be entered. McVeigh v. United States, supra. See also Windsor v. McVeigh, \n93 U.S. 274\n, 280; Hovey v. Elliott, \n167 U.S. 409\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 841. It is now represented by counsel. But intercourse is prohibited by law between subjects of Austria-Hungary outside the United States and persons in the United States. Trading with the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, c. 106,  3 ( c), 40 Stat. 412, Public-No. 91-65th Congress. And we take notice of the fact that free intercourse between residents of the two countries has been also physically impossible. It is true that, more than three years ago, a stipulation as to the facts and the proof of foreign law was entered into by the then counsel for respondent, who has died since. But reasons may conceivably exist why that stipulation ought to be discharged or modified, or why it should be supplemented by evidence. We cannot say that, for the proper conduct of the defense, consultation between client and counsel and intercourse between their respective countries may not be essential even at this stage. The war precludes this.\n Under these circumstances, we are of opinion that the decree dismissing the libel should be set aside and the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings, but that no action should be taken there (except such, if any, as may be required to preserve the security and the rights of the parties in statu quo) until, by reason of the restoration of peace between the United States and Austria-Hungary, or otherwise, it may become \n\n[248 U.S. 9, 23]\n\u00a0\n possible for the respondent to present its defense adequately.

U S(1918)\nNo. 109\nArgued: Decided: February 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 618, 619]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter Jeffreys Carlin, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Solicitor General Davis and Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a prosecution under the Act of June 30, 1906, c. 3915, 34 Stat. 768, upon a charge of shipping an article of food in interstate commerce in circumstances making the shipment a violation of the act. The information contained two counts, both charging that the article was misbranded-one because it bore a false and misleading label, and the other because it was offered for sale as lemon oil when in truth it was an imitation thereof containing alcohol and citral derived from lemon grass. In the District Court there was a conviction upon both counts, and the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the conviction as \n\n[245 U.S. 618, 620]\n\u00a0\n to the first count and affirmed it as to the second. 224 Fed. 64, 139 C. C. A. 626. The judgment upon the latter is all that is brought here for review.\n The defendant was engaged in making and selling various articles of food used by bakers, confectioners and ice cream makers, including the article with which this prosecution is concerned. On the occasion in question he shipped from one state to another a quantity of this article labeled 'Special Lemon. Lemon Terpene and Citral.' The printed record, although not purporting to contain all the evidence, shows that there was testimony tending to prove the following facts, among others: The shipment was made to fill an order solicited and taken by a traveling salesman in the defendant's employ. The salesman had been supplied by the defendant with a sample bottle of the article which was labeled simply 'Special Lemon.' In offering the article for sale and soliciting the order the salesman exhibited the sample and represented that the article was pure lemon oil obtained by a second pressing and that this pressing produced a good, if not the best, oil. In truth the article was not lemon oil, but an imitation thereof containing alcohol and citral made from lemon grass. Some of the elements of lemon oil were present in other than the usual proportions and others were entirely wanting.\n The testimony respecting the salesma 's representations was admitted over the defendant's objection; and later the court denied a request on the part of the defendant that the jury be instructed that this testimony could not be considered, but only the statement appearing on the label when the article was shipped. In that connection the court told the jury that the defendant could not be held responsible criminally by reason of any representations made by the salesman unless it appeared beyond a reasonable doubt that the same were made by the defendant's authority. \n\n[245 U.S. 618, 621]\n\u00a0\n The defendant, who is the petitioner here, complains of the admission and consideration of this testimony and insists that under the statute the question whether an article is misbranded turns entirely upon how it is labeled when it is shipped, regardless of any representations made by a salesman, or even the vendor, in offering it for sale.\n The statute, in its second section (Comp. St. 1916,  8718), makes it unlawful to ship or deliver for shipment from one state to another 'any article of food or drugs which is adulterated or misbranded, within the meaning of this act.' In its eighth section (section 8724) it declares:\n'That the term 'misbranded,' as used herein, shall apply to all drugs, or articles of food, or articles which enter into the composition of food, the package or label of which shall bear any statement, design, or device regarding such article, or the ingredients or substances contained therein which shall be false or misleading in any particular, and to any food or drug product which is falsely branded as to the state, territory, or country in which it is manufactured or produced.\n\n'That for the purposes of this act an article shall also be deemed to be misbranded:\n\n'In the case of drugs:\n\n ...\n'In the case of food:\n\n'First. If it be an imitation of or offered for sale under the distinctive name of another article.'\n\n This section contains other provisions relating to misbranding, but they are not material here, and need not be set forth or specially noticed.\n It is apparent that the statute specifies and defines at least two kinds of misbranding-one where the article bears a false or misleading label, and the other where it is offered for sale under the distinctive name of another article. The two are quite distinct, a deceptive label being an essential element of one, but not of the other. No \n\n[245 U.S. 618, 622]\n\u00a0\n doubt both involve a measure of deception, but they differ in respect of the mode in which it is practiced. Evidently each is intended to cover a field of its own, for otherwise there would be no occasion for specifying and defining both. That one article of food may be offered for sale in the distinctive name of another, and the offer accomplish its purpose, without the aid of a false or misleading label hardly needs statement.\n The statute does not attempt to make either kind of misbranding unlawful in itself, but does, as before indicated, make it unlawful to ship or deliver for shipment from one state to another an article of food which is misbranded in either way. That this is a legitimate exertion of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce is settled by our decisions. Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, \n220 U.S. 45\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 364; McDermott v. Wisconsin, \n228 \nU.S. 115, 128\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 431, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 984, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 39; Seven Cases of Eckman's Alterative v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 510, 514\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 190, L. R. A. 1916D, 164. It also is settled by our decisions that 'the negotiation of sales of goods which are in another state, for the purpose of introducing them into the state in which the negotiation is made, is interstate commerce.' Robbins v. Shelby Taxing District, \n120 \nU.S. 489, 497\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 592, 596 (30 L. Ed. 694); Crenshaw v. Arkansas, \n227 \nU.S. 389, 396\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 294.\n It follows that the testimony respecting the representations of the defendant's traveling salesman was rightly admitted in evidence nd submitted to the jury. It tended to prove that the order, to fill which the shipment was made, was obtained by offering the article for sale in the distinctive name of another article, and therefore that the article was misbranded within the meaning of the statute. To have confined the jury's attention to the label borne by the article when it was shipped, as was requested by the defendant, would have been to disregard the nature of the charge in the second count and the distinction between the two kinds of misbranding.\n In the Circuit Court of Appeals the view was expressed \n\n[245 U.S. 618, 623]\n\u00a0\n that intent was not an element of the offense charged in the second count and therefore that it was immaterial whether the representations of the salesman had the sanction of the defendant. Complaint is now made of this. But the question is not in the case, the view expressed by the Circuit Court of Appeals not being essential to an affirmance of the judgment. The District Court had expressly instructed the jury that to hold the defendant responsible criminally by reason of such representations it must appear, and appear beyond a reasonable doubt, that they were made by his authority. The record before us does not show that the defendant objected to the submission of this question to the jury in this way; neither does it purport to contain all the evidence. The verdict therefore must be taken as conclusively determining that the representations were made with the defendant's sanction.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","194":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWELLS FARGO & CO. v. NEVADA(1918)\nNo. 40\nArgued: November 14, 1918Decided: December 16, 1918\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles W. Stockton, of New York City, Henry M. Hoyt, of San Francisco, Cal., and Harry S. Marx, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. William C. Prentiss, of Washington, D. C., for the State of Nevada. \n\n[248 U.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action to enforce a tax levied in Humboldt county, Nevada, against the express company. Several objections were interposed, some presenting local and others federal questions, but all were overruled and payment of the tax directed. 38 Nev. 505, 150 Pac. 836. This writ of error was allowed prior to the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726.\n The federal questions are all that we can consider, and they are: Whether the tax was laid on the privilege or act of engaging in interstate commerce, whether the tax proceedings were without due process of law and whether they otherwise were such as to make the tax a burden on interstate commerce.\n The company is a Colorado corporation engaged in the express business in this and other countries. One of its lines extends through Humboldt and other counties in Nevada, over the Southern Pacific Railroad, and is used in both intrastate and interstate commerce, but principally the latter. The tax was for the year 1910\n\n\n As construed by the state court, the statute1 under which the tax was imposed does not provide for a privilege or franchise tax, but only for an ad valorem property tax. Acting under the statute, a state board valued the company's personal property, tangible and intangible, used in its express business within the state at $300 per mile of line; and it then became the duty of the assessor of Humboldt county to enter or list on the assessment roll at that valuation so much of the line as was in his county. In making the entry he accurately gave the length of the line in the county, the railroad over which the same was operated and the valuation fixed by the state board, but \n\n[248 U.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n inaccurately described the property as consisting of the right to carry on an express business there.\n Looking only at that entry there is strong ground for saying that the tax was laid on the privilege or act of doing an express business which was principally interstate. On the other hand, the action of the state board, on which the assessment concededly was predicated, indicates that what was taxed was the company's property in Humboldt county. The difference is vital, for, consistently with the commerce clause of the federal Constitution, the state could not tax the privilege or act of engaging in interstate commerce, but could tax the company's property within the state, although chiefly employed in such commerce. Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, \n165 \nU.S. 194, 220\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 305; s. c., \n166 \nU.S. 185, 218\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 604, 41 Ed. 965; Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n210 U.S. 217\n, 225-227, 28 Sup. Ct. 638; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450, 453\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 373.\n The company insists that the state is concluded by the entry on the assessment roll. But the state court, as shown in its opinion, rejects that view and holds, in effect, that the entry must be construed in the light of the statute and the action of the state board, and that when this is done it is apparent that the tax was not laid on the privilege or act of engaging in interstate commerce, but on the company's property within the county. We perceive no ground for disturbing that ruling. In so far as it turns on the authority of the state board and the assessor under the statute and the relative effect to be given to their acts it is not reviewable here, and in so far as it relates to what really was the subject of the tax we think it was right. See Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, supra. \n246 U.S. 454\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 373. Evidently the company at one time took this view of the tax, for in an amendment to its answer we find an allegation that the state board 'valued the property used by this defendant at the rate or sum of \n\n[248 U.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n $300 for every mile of railroad over which this defendant transacted business and apportioned said assessment or tax to the various counties of the state in accordance with the number of miles of such railroad so situated within said county, and that the tax herein sued for was not otherwise levied or assessed.'\n A want of due process of law in the sense of the Fourteenth Amendment is asserted because the valuation by the state board was made without notice to the company or according it an opportunity to be heard. Assuming that the premise is correct (as to which the record is not entirely clear), we are unable to accept the conclusion. In Nevada the mode of enforcing a tax such as this is by a judicial proceeding wherein process issues and an opportunity is afforded for a full hearing. Only after there is a judgment sustaining the tax is payment enforced. Rev. Laws 1912,  3659-3665. This, as repeatedly has been held, satisfies the requirements of due process of law. Hagar v. Reclamation District, \n111 U.S. 701\n, 4 Sup. Ct. 663; Winona & St. Peter Land Co. v. Minnesota, \n159 \nU.S. 526, 537\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 83; Gallup v. Schmidt, \n183 \nU.S. 300, 307\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 162.\n It also is asserted that the state board in valuing the property acted on inaccurate data and applied erroneous standards which resulted in a valuation so excessive as to make the tax a burden on interstate commerce. It is true that some inaccurate data and some computations following erroneous standards were presented to the board by a state officer in support of a suggestion that the property be valued at $500 or more per mile of line. But the suggestion was not adopted, and it is not shown that the board's valuation was based on the data and computations so presented. Besides, if the valuation was excessive, the company was entitled in the present suit to show the true value and to have the tax reduced accordingly. Rev. Laws 1912,  3664. An attempt at such a showing was made, but the state court concluded \n\n[248 U.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n therefrom that a valuation of $300 per mile, as fixed by the board, was not excessive. It may be that the showing was not complete, but, even if so, it was the company's showing and was all that was before the court. After examining it we think it discloses no ground for condeming the tax as a burden on interstate commerce.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revised Laws 1912,  3621, 3622, 3624, 3797-3801, 3807. \n\n\n\n\n","195":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWELLS v.

The Supreme Court sustained a \n\n[246 U.S. 335, 336]\n\u00a0\n motion to dismiss the bill, its decree to that effect was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (44 App. D. C. 276), and plaintiff appeals to this court.\n The contract was made February 14, 1913, and by it plaintiff agreed for a stated compensation to furnish, during a period of four years a number of automobiles (with chaffeurs) specially equipped according to specifications for use in collecting and delivering mail at Washington, D. C. One of its provisions (the third) was a stipulation that:\n'Any or all of the equipments contracted for herein may be discontinued at any time upon ninety days' notice from the said party of the first part,' meaning the Postmaster General.\n\n Another was:\n'18. That all acts done by the First Assistant Postmaster General in respect of this contract shall be deemed and taken, for all purposes, to be the acts of the Postmaster General, within the meaning and intent of this contract.'\n\n Plaintiff expended considerable sums of money and incurred substantial obligations in providing automobiles and other special equipment necessary for the performance of the contract, and continued to perform it for nearly two years. Then the Postmaster General, acting under a provision of an appropriation act approved March 9, 1914 (chapter 33, 38 Stat. 295, 300), by which he was authorized in his discretion to use such portion of a certain appropriation as might be necessary 'for the purchase and maintenance of wagons or automobiles for and the operation of an experimental combined screened wagon and city collection and delivery service,' determined it to be in the interest of the public service that such an experiment should be conducted at Washington, D. C., and in order to do this deemed it necessary to discontinue the service then being performed by plaintiff. Accordingly the First Assistant Postmaster General notified plaintiff in writing that it was essential for the purpose mentioned that his \n\n[246 U.S. 335, 337]\n\u00a0\n contract should be canceled, and that 'under the third stipulation of the contract the use of all the automobiles furnished thereunder will be discontinued at the close of business January 31, 1915, and the contract canceled effective on that date.' Notwithstanding protest by plaintiff, this decision was adhered to, and the present suit was commenced.\n Both courts held it to be essentially and substantially a suit against the United States and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the court, and in this view we concur. The effect of the injunction asked for would have been to oblige the United States to accept continued performance of plaintiff's contract, and thus prevent the inauguration of the experimental service contemplated by the act of 1914-a direct interference with one of the processes of government. The argument to the contrary assumes to treat defendant, not as an official, but as an individual who, although happening to hold public office, was threatening to perpetrate an unlawful act outside of its functions. But the averments of the bill make it clear that defendant was without personal interest and was acting solely in his official capacity and within the scope of his duties. Indeed, it was only because of his official authority that plaintiff's interests were at all endangered by what he proposed to do.\n That the interests of the government are so directly involved as to make the United States a necessary party and therefore to be considered as in effect a party, although not named in the bill, is entirely plain. And the case does n t fall within any of the exceptions to the general rule that the United States may not be sued without its consent, nor its executive agents subjected to the control of the courts respecting the performance of their official duties. It cannot successfully be contended that any question of defendant's official authority is involved; it is a mere question of action alleged to be inconsistent \n\n[246 U.S. 335, 338]\n\u00a0\n with the stipulation under which it purported to be taken; nor can it be denied that the duty of the Postmaster General, and of the defendant as his deputy, was executive in character, not ministerial, and required an exercise of official discretion. And neither the question of official authority nor that of official discretion is affected, for present purposes, by assuming or conceding, for the purposes of the argument, that the proposed action may have been unwarranted by the terms of the contract and such as to constitute an actionable breach of that contract by the United States. See Noble v. Union River Logging Railroad, \n147 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 271, and cases cited; Belknap v. Schild, \n161 \nU.S. 10, 17\n, 18 S., 16 Sup.

Ct. 340.\n The United States has consented to be sued in the Court of Claims and in the District Courts upon claims of a certain class, and not otherwise. Hence, without considering other questions discussed by the courts below or raised by appellant in this court, we conclude that the dismissal of the bill was not erroneous.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","196":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH CO. v.

Gen., for Public Service Commission of Massachusetts.\n\n\n[247 U.S. 105, 110]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Four cases were argued together in this Court. The first two were suits in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, one a statutory petition by the telegraph companies to have an order of the Public Service Commission annulled, the other a bill by the Commission to have the same order enforced. The cases were consolidated and reserved on the pleadings for determination by the full Court, which decreed that the petition of the plaintiffs in error should be dismissed and the order of \n\n[247 U.S. 105, 111]\n\u00a0\n the Commission obeyed. 224 Mass. 365, 113 N. E. 192. The order recited that the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company by the Western Union Telegraph Company lessee and the United Telegram Company had without just cause refused to supply to Calvin H. Foster the continuous quotations of the New York Stock Exchange by means of ticker service then supplied to others, declared the refusal an unlawful discrimination a d required the two companies to remove the discrimination forthwith.\n The material facts may be abridged as follows: The New York Stock Exchange, having a monopoly of the information collected by it on the floor of the Exchange concerning the prices quoted in transactions there, made contracts with the plaintiffs in error of the same general character as those before the Court in Board of Trade v. Christie Grain & Stock Co., \n198 \nU.S. 236, 246\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 637, and Hunt v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n205 U.S. 322\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 529. By these contracts for specified lump sums the Exchange agreed to furnish to the Telegraph Companies simultaneously full and continuous quotations of prices made in transactions upon the Exchange. The Telegraph Companies 'may' in their turn furnish quotations to their 'patrons' at intervals of more than fifteen minutes subject to discontinuance upon objection of the Exchange, and may furnish continuous service by ticker to subscribers, provided the latter sign applications in duplicate, one of which is to go to the Exchange, the application not to be effectual until the subscriber is approved by the Exchange, agreeing that the Telegraph Company may discontinue the service, 'whenever directed so to do by said new York Stock Exchange.' The application recognizes that the quotations are furnished under contract with the Exchange and agrees not to furnish the quotations to branch offices or correspondents unless first approved by the Exchange and also signing agreements, one of which is to be delivered to the Exchange. The contract states \n\n[247 U.S. 105, 112]\n\u00a0\n that the intent of the Exchange in reserving the right to disapprove, etc., is only to prevent improper and unlawful use of the facts.\n The Gold and Stock Telegraph Company's business is carried on by the Western Union Telegraph Company in the name of the former. The quotations are furnished to the latter in New York, telegraphed by it to the office of the Gold and Stock Company in Boston, translated from the Morse code into English, and thence transmitted by an operator to the tickers in the offices of the brokers who have subscribed and have been approved. The United Telegram Company, a New Jersey corporation, receives quotations for Boston alone, where is its principal office outside of New Jersey. They are furnished by the Exchange in New York, telegraphed to the Boston office over a wire of the Postal Telegraph Cable Company, and thence transmitted as in the other case. On these facts the plaintiffs in error say that the order is an unwarranted interference with commerce among the States and takes property without due process of law, setting up the Constitution of the United States.\n We shall not discuss the bearing of the Fourteenth Amendment nor yet how far an order simply to remove a discrimination could be effectual when if Mr. Foster were let in on the same terms as those now accepted as subscribers, he would agree that the Telegraph Company might discontinue its service without notice whenever directed so to do by the New York Stock Exchange. It is enough that in our opinion the transmission of the quotations did not lose its character of interstate commerce until it was completed in the brokers' offices and that the interference with it was of a kind not permitted to the States. The supposed analogy that has prevailed is that of a receiver of a package breaking bulk and selling at will in retail trade. But it appears to us misleading. We also think it unimportant that the contracts between the Ex- \n\n[247 U.S. 105, 113]\n\u00a0\n change and the Telegraph Companies emphasize the element of quasi-sale for lump sum and leave it to the interest of the Telegraph Companies to find subscribers. Neither that nor the intervention of an operator, or of another company, are in the least degree conclusive. Unlike the case of breaking bulk for subsequently determined retail sales, in these the ultimate recipients are determined before the message starts and have been accepted as the contemplate recipients by the Exchange. It does not matter if they have no contract with the Exchange, directly. It does not matter that if the Telegraph Companies did not deliver to any given one the Exchange could not complain. If the normal, contemplated and followed course is a transmission as continuous and rapid as science can make it from Exchange to broker's office it does not matter what are the stages or how little they are secured by covenant or bond.\n Thus lumber purchased in Texas for the purpose of filling foreign orders was held to be carried in interstate commerce, although no contract prevented the purchaser from giving it a different destination. Texas & New Orleans R. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., \n227 \nU.S. 111, 126\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 229. Practice, intent and the typical course, not title or niceties of form, were recognized as determining the character, and other cases to the same effect were cited. The principle was reaffirmed in Railroad Commission of Louisiana v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., \n229 U.S. 336\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 837; and is too well settled to need to be further sustained Western Oil Refining Co. v. Lipscomb, \n244 \nU.S. 346, 349\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 623. See Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 398\n, 399 S., 25 Sup. Ct. 276. It is admitted that the transmission from New York to Massachusetts by the Telegraph Company was interstate commerce. If so it continued such until it reached 'the point where the parties originally intended that the movement should finally end.' Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Louisiana R. R. Commission, \n236 \nU.S. 157, 163\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 275. \n\n[247 U.S. 105, 114]\n\u00a0\n If the transmission of the quotations is interstate commerce the order in question cannot be sustained. It is not like the requirement of some incidental convenience that can be afforded without seriously impeding the interstate work. It is an attempt to affect in its very vitals the character of a business generically withdrawn from state control-to change the criteria by which customers are to be determined and so to change the business. It is suggested that the State gets the power from its power over the streets which it is necessary for the telegraph to cross. But if we assume that the plaintiffs in error under their present charters could be excluded from the streets, the consequence would not follow. Acts generally lawful may become unlawful when done to accomplish an unlawful end, United States v. Reading Co., \n226 \nU.S. 324, 357\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 90, and a constitutional power cannot be used by way of condition to attain an unconstitutional result. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 190; Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 56\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 232; Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, \n235 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 57. The regulation in question is quite as great an interference as a tax of the kind that repeated decisions have held void. It cannot be justified 'under that somewhat ambiguous term of police powers.' Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Pendleton, \n122 \nU.S. 347, 359\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 1126; Leisy v. Hardin, \n135 U.S. 100\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 681; Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 520\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 715; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Brown, \n234 \nU.S. 542, 547\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 955. Without going into further reasons we are of opinion that the decree of the Supreme Judicial Court must be reversed.\n The other two cases were suits brought by the New York Stock Exchange against the Telegraph Companies severally and Foster. The bills set forth the respective contracts with the companies, allege that Foster made applications to them in the prescribed form, was given a full hearing before a committee of the Exchange, and that as a result the Exchange reached the conclusion that \n\n[247 U.S. 105, 115]\n\u00a0\n Foster had been conducting bucket shops and wanted the quotations in aid of such shops, and therefore disapproved the appl cations. They set forth the order of the State Commission, the decree of the State Court and the intent of the Telegraph Companies to comply with the order, and allege that it is void as beyond the jurisdiction of the State Commission under the Constitution and Acts of Congress and also as depriving the plaintiff of its property without due process of law. Injunctions are prayed against delivery of continuous quotations to Foster or receipt of them by him unless and until he shall have acquired the right by contract with the approval of the Exchange. Subsequently the members of the Public Service Commission were made parties, and then upon their motion the bills were dismissed by the District Court, the judge accepting the reasoning of the Supreme Court of the State. The decision seems to have been upon the merits, but the question is certified whether the bill presents a controversy which arises under the Constitution or laws of the United States within the meaning of section 24 of the Judicial Code (Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1091 [Comp. St. 1916,  991]). In view of the decision in the State cases probably it will not be necessary to prosecute these suits farther. But it follows from what we have said that the decision of the District Court was wrong and that the decrees in these cases also must be reversed. It is suggested, to be sure, that the Exchange would be barred by the state decree against the Telegraph Companies if it stood, because the Exchange by its contracts reserved the right to intervene in such suits. It did not intervene and therefore would not have been bound.\n Decrees reversed. \n\n\n\n","197":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLIAM E. PECK & CO. v. LOWE(1918)\nNo. 234\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles P. Spooner, of New York City, and Richard V. Lindabury, of Newark, N. J., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[247 U.S. 165, 171]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Fitts, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action to recover a tax paid under protest and alleged to have been imposed contrary to the con- \n\n[247 U.S. 165, 172]\n\u00a0\n stitutional provision (article 1,  9, cl. 5) that 'no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.' The judgment below was for the defendant. 234 Fed. 125.\n The plaintiff is a domestic corporation chiefly engaged in buying goods in the several states, shipping them to foreign countries and there selling them. In 1914 its net income from this business was $30,173.66, and from other sources $12,436.24. An income tax for that year, computed on the aggregate of these sums, was assessed against it and paid under compulsion. It is conceded that so much of the tax as was based on the income from other sources was valid, and the controversy is over so much of it as was attributable to the income from shipping goods to foreign countries and there selling them.\n The tax was levied under the Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16,  11, 38 Stat. 166, 172, which provided for annually subjecting every domestic corporation to the payment of a tax of a specified per centum of its 'entire net income arising or accruing from all sources during the preceding calendar year.' Certain fraternal and other co porations, as also income from certain enumerated sources, were specifically excepted, but none of the exceptions included the plaintiff or any part of its income. So, tested merely by the terms of the act, the tax collected from the plaintiff was rightly computed on its total net income. But as the act obviously could not impose a tax forbidden by the Constitution, we proceed to consider whether the tax, or rather the part in question, was forbidden by the constitutional provision on which the plaintiff relies.\n The Sixteenth Amendment, although referred to in argument, has no real bearing and may be put out of view. As pointed out in recent decisions, it does not extend the taxing power to new or excepted subjects, but merely removes all occasion, which otherwise might exist, for an apportionment among the states of taxes \n\n[247 U.S. 165, 173]\n\u00a0\n laid on income, whether it be derived from one source or another. Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n240 U.S. 1\n, 17-19, 36 Sup. Ct. 236, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, L. R. A. 1917D, 414; Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., \n240 U.S. 103\n, 112-113, 36 Sup. Ct. 278.\n The Constitution broadly empowers Congress not only 'to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises,' but also 'to regulate commerce with foreign nations.' So, if the prohibitory clause invoked by the plaintiff be not in the way, Congress undoubtedly has power to lay and collect such a tax as is here in question. That clause says 'no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.' Of course it qualifies and restricts the power to tax as broadly conferred. But to what extent? The decisions of this court answer that it excepts from the range of that power articles in course of exportation, Turpin v. Burgess, \n117 \nU.S. 504, 507\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 835; the act or occupation of exporting, Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 445; bills of lading for articles being exported, Fairbank v. United States, \n181 U.S. 283\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 648; charter parties for the carriage of cargoes from state to foreign ports, United States v. Hvoslef, \n237 U.S. 1\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 459, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 286; and policies of marine insurance on articles being exported-such insurance being uniformly regarded as 'an integral part of the exportation' and the policy as 'one of the ordinary shipping documents,' Thames & Mersey Ins. Co. v. United States, \n237 U.S. 19\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 496, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 1087. In short, the court has interpreted the clause as meaning that exportation must be free from taxation, and therefore as requiring 'not simply an omission of a tax upon the articles exported, but also a freedom from any tax which directly burdens the exportation.' Fairbank v. United States, supra, \n181 U.S. 292\n-293, 21 Sup. Ct. 648. And the court has indicated that where the tax is not laid on the articles themselves while in course of exportation the true test of its validity is whether it 'so directly and closely' bears on the 'process of exporting' as to be in substance a tax on the exportation. Thames & Mersey Ins. \n\n[247 U.S. 165, 174]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. United States, supra, \n237 U.S. 25\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 496, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 1087. In this view it has been held that the clause does not condemn or invalidate charges or taxes, not laid on property while being exported, merely because they affect exportation indirectly or remotely. Thus a charge for stamps which each package of manufactured tobacco intended for export was required to bear before removal from the factory was upheld in Pace v. Burgess, \n92 U.S. 372\n, and Turpin v. Burgess, \n117 U.S. 504\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 835; and the application of a manufacturing tax on all filled cheese to cheese manufactured under contract for export, and actually exported, was upheld in Cornell v. Coyne, \n192 \nU.S. 418, 427\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 383, 384 (48 L. Ed. 504). In that case it was said:\n'The true construction of the constitutional provision is that no burden by way of tax or duty can be cast upon the exportation of articles, and does not mean that articles exported are relieved from the prior ordinary burdens of taxation which rest upon all property similarly situated. The exemption attaches to the export and not to the article before its exportation.'\n\n While fully assenting and adhering to the interpretation which has been put on the clause in giving effect to its spirit as well as its letter, we are of opinion that to broaden that interpretation would be to depart from both the spirit and letter.\n The tax in question is unlike any of those heretofore condemned. It is not laid on articles in course of exportation or on anything which inherently or by the usages of commerce is embraced in exportation or any of its processes. On the contrary, it is an income tax laid generally on net incomes. And while it cannot be applied to any income which Congress has no power to tax (see Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., supra, 240 U. S. p. 113, 36 Sup. Ct. 278), it is both nominally and actually a general tax. It is not laid on income from exportation because of its source, or in a discriminative way, but just as it is laid on other income. The words of the act are 'net income arising or accruing \n\n[247 U.S. 165, 175]\n\u00a0\n from all sources.' There is no discrimination. At most, exportation is affected only indirectly and remotely. The tax is levied after exportation is completed, after all expenses are paid and losses adjusted, and after the recipient of the income is free to use it as he chooses. Thus what is taxed-the net income-is as far removed from exportation as are articles intended for export before the exportation begins. If articles manufactured and intended for export are subject to taxation under general laws up to the time they are put in course of exportation, as we have seen they are, the conclusion is unavoidable that the net income from the venture when completed, that is to say, after the exportation and sale are fully consummated, is likewise subject to taxation under general laws. In that respect the status of the income is not different from that of the exported articles prior to the exportation.\n For these reasons we hold that the objection urged against the tax is not well grounded.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","198":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWM FILENE'S SONS CO. v. WEED(1918)\nNo. 93\nArgued: Decided: February 4, 1918\n\n\n\n\n[245 U.S. 597, 598]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George R. Nutter, James Butler Studley, and Louis D. Brandeis, all of Boston, Mass., and Francis B. James, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Frederick H. Nash and Charles F. Choate, Jr., both of Boston, Mass., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes to this Court by writ of certiorari upon a bill for instructions filed by the receivers of William S. Butler and Company, incorporated. The receivers were appointed upon the prayer of a creditor, assented to by the corporation, in a bill brought for continuing the business until the assets could be applied in satisfaction of the com- \n\n[245 U.S. 597, 599]\n\u00a0\n pany's debts. Instructions are asked as to the amount to be paid to the petitioner, Wm. Filene's Sons Company, under a lease of the premises that William S. Butler & Co. occupied. The lease covered five parcels of land held by the petitioner, also as lessee, and ran for the terms, less one day, of the respective original leases, which expired at different dates, from December 30, 1917, to February 28, 1921. It provided for a reentry in case of a failure to perform any covenant, of bankruptcy, etc., or of a receiver being appointed and not discharged within ninety days. These proceedings were begun on November 7, 1912. On December 5, 1912, the receiver elected not to assume the lease and left the rent due December 1, unpaid; on December 9 the petitioner reentered in pursuance of leave granted by the Court, and on December 17 made demand upon the receiver for the sum that it alleges to be due. The receiver filed this petition for instructions on April 7, 1913. On September 30, 1913, the petitioner filed a formal claim, the time for proving claims not yet having expired.\n The lease is made in consideration of the lessee's covenant to pay twenty thousand dollars a year until February 27, 1921 (the day before the longest of the original leases expired,) and of the other covenants therein contained by the lessee to be performed. The reddendum requires the payment as rental of all sums payable by the lessor under the leases to it at the times specified in their leases, 'together with a further sum of twenty thousand dollars yearly, payable in equal monthly instalments until February 27, 1921.' The lessor agrees, at the joint request of the lessee and the overlessors in all the original leases in force at the time, to cancel the overleases and abate the rent in respect of them upon payment of a sum equal to $20,000 a year for the residue of the term plus one day, 'less a discount at the rate of five per cent. per annum on payments so anticipated.' There is a proviso \n\n[245 U.S. 597, 600]\n\u00a0\n for an abatement of rent and other payments in case of fire, the taking of part of the premises, etc., 'except said payment of twenty thousand dollars per year'; and there is a further stipulation that if the overlease of any part of the demised premises is terminated, the payment of twenty thousand d llars per year shall continue without any abatement. Finally it is agreed that upon a termination of the lease as provided for the lessee will pay to the lessor, upon demand, a sum equal to twenty thousand dollars per year and at the same rate for a fractional part of a year, for so much of the period up to February 27, 1921, as remains unexpired, with one day added (less the five per cent. discount, as aforesaid), and will further make one of three several payments at the election of the lessor, of which it is only necessary to mention the second. This was to pay to the lessor as damages, the difference between the rental value and the rent and other payments named in the lease for the residue of the term, deducting, however, such sum as has been paid for the same period under the clause requiring the payment of twenty thousand dollars a year.\n The substance of the petitioner's claim as argued before us is for a sum equal to twenty thousand dollars a year in monthly payments from December 9, 1912, to February 28, 1921, less a discount at the rate of five per centum per annum on the payments anticipated, and for whatever sum may represent its damages estimated in the manner that we have just stated as stipulated in the lease. The Courts below were of opinion that the twenty thousand dollars were simply an addition to the rent, that the provisions for payment upon termination of the lease were an attempt to secure a preference by accelerating the instalments and also were in the nature of a penalty, that the analogy of bankruptcy applied, and that the claim for the above-mentioned items could not be allowed. The Circuit Court of Appeals seems to have considered also \n\n[245 U.S. 597, 601]\n\u00a0\n that the filing of the bill had the same effect as a petition in bankruptcy in stopping claims that like this were not provable at that date. 230 Fed. 31, 144 C. C. A. 329.\n We are driven to different conclusions. In the first place, whether a letter showing that the payment of $20,000 a year was a substitute for a bonus of $340,000 was admissible or not, United States v. Bethlehem Steel Co., \n205 \nU.S. 105, 120\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 450, we are of opinion that on the face of the lease and the figures it was dealt with as a separate item and as the inducing consideration for the sublease, the right to the whole of which was earned when the sublease was made. The summary of the clauses referring to it that we have given shows that the whole amount was to be paid in any event, whether the overleases were cancelled, or a part of the rent was abated, or the leases were terminated, as well as if they ran their full course. It is true that in the reddendum the words 'as rental' might be construed to embrace the later clause 'together with a further sum of $20,000,' but the sentence does not compel that construction and the dominant intent and obvious fact seems to us to override any argument upon that ground. See Cox v. Harper, \n\n[245 U.S. 597, 1910]\n\u00a0\n 1 ch. 480. Rent issues from the land, is not due until the rent day, and is due in respect of the enjoyment of the premises let. The twenty thousand dollars a year was to be paid whether the premises were enjoyed or not, upon a personal covernant that created a present debt, with no contingency except those possibly and lawfully accelerating the time in which it was to be paid.\n We perceive no ground that would justify the rejection of the petitioner's proof for the whole sum subject to the discount agreed. Certainly the fact that the termination of the lease happened after the filing of the bill has no such effect, although the sum was not presently payable until then. When a statutory system is administered the only \n\n[245 U.S. 597, 602]\n\u00a0\n question for the Courts is what the statutes prescribe. But when the Courts without statute take possession of all the assets of a corporation under a bill like the present and so make it impossible to collect debts except from the Court's hands, they have no warrant for excluding creditors, or for introducing supposed equities other than those determined by the ontracts that the debtor was content to make and the creditors to accept. In order to make a distribution possible they must of necessity limit the time for the proof of claims. But they have no authority to give to the filing of the bill the effect of the filing of a petition in bankruptcy so as to exclude any previously made and lawful claim that matures within a reasonable time before distribution can be made. Pennsylvania Steel Co. v. New York City Ry. Co., 198 Fed. 721, 740, 741, 117 C. C. A. 503. Of course it does not matter that the claim was perfected by the petitioner's act, after a default in the rent. The receivers would not, and Butler & Company could not pay it, so that all agree that the petitioner's course was the prudent and only possible course to take, as it was the course that was contemplated by the covenant in the lease. Wilder v. McDonald, 63 Ohio St. 383, 397, 59 N. E. 106.\n We agree with the petitioner that the discount on payments so anticipated should be a simple discount on the payments as they would fall due, that is, monthly, making the total according to the Master's report, $ 137,348.88.\n The rest of the claim is for damages ultra the twenty thousand dollars a year-the difference between the rental value at the date of entry and the rent reserved, less the amount received under the twenty thousand dollar clause. This also was contracted for and we see no reason why it should not be paid. The contract was not that all the rent for the term should become presently due, it was not for rent at all, but was a personal covenant that liquidated the damages upon a footing that was familiar and fair.

The claim divides itself into two items: One from January 1, 1913, until April 1, 1913, when the whole premises were relet, put by the master at $39,829.80; the other from April 1, 1913, to the end of the term, put at $34,433.47. The other disputed item for expenses of reletting is disallowed.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS having been of counsel took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","199":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nYORK MFG CO. v. COLLEY(1918)\nNo. 200\nArgued: March 18, 1918Decided: May 20, 1918\n\n\n\n Mr. N. C. Abbott, of Houston, Tex., for plaintiff in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The York Manufacturing Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, sued for the amount due upon a contract for the purchase of ice-manufacturing machinery and to foreclose a lien upon the same. By answer the defendants alleged that the plaintiff was a foreign corporation; that \n\n[247 U.S. 21, 22]\n\u00a0\n it maintained an office and transacted business in Texas without having obtained a permit therefor and was hence under Texas statutes not authorized to prosecute the suit in the courts of the state and a dismissal was prayed. In reply the plaintiff averred that the contract sued on was interstate commerce and that the state statute if held to apply was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. At the trial it was shown without dispute that the contract covered an ice plant guaranteed to produce three of ice a day, consisting of gas compression pumps, a compressor, ammonia condensers, freezing tank and cans, evaporating coils, a brine agitator and other machinery and accessories, including apparatus for utilizing exhaust steam for making distilled water for filling the ice cans. These parts of machinery, it was provided, were to be shipped from Pennsylvania to the point of delivery in Texas and were there to be erected and connected. This work, it was stipulated, was to be done under the supervision of an engineer to be sent by the York Manufacturing Company for whose services a fixed per diem charge of $6 was to be paid by the purchasers and who should have the assistance of mechanics furnished by the purchasers, the supervision to include not only the erection but the submitting of the machinery to a practical test in operation before the obligation to finally receive it would arise. It was moreover undisputed that these provisions were carried out; that about three weeks were consumed in erecting the machinery and about a week in practically testing it, when after a demonstration of its successful operation it was accepted by the purchasers.\n The trial court, not doubting that the contract of sale was interstate commerce, nevertheless concluding that the stipulation as to supervision by an engineer to be sent by the seller was intrastate commerce and wholly separable from the interstate transaction, held that the seller by car- \n\n[247 U.S. 21, 23]\n\u00a0\n rying out that provision had engaged in local business in the state, and, as the permit required by the state statutes had not been secured, gave effect to the statutes and dismissed the suit. The case is here to review the action of the court below sustaining such conclusion, its judgment being that of the court of last resort of the state in consequence of the refusal of the Supreme Court of the state to allow a writ of error.\n Referring to a previous ruling (Leschen & Sons Rope Co. v. Moser [Tex. Civ. App.] 159 S. W. 1018), in which it had held that the performance by a contractor of the duty of supervising the construction of a compley system of tramways did not constitute a doing of business within the state because it was relevant to and a part of the main contract for the material from which the road was to be constructed which was interstate commerce, the court below concluded that that case had been by it mistakenly decided, and therefore should be overruled and not applied in this. The conclusion as to previous error committed, the court said, was persuasively the result of the ruling in Browning v. Waycross, \n233 U.S. 16\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 578, which it treated as here conclusively determining that the performance of the contract for the supervision by the engineer was purely intrastate commerce and subject to be treated as such although it formed a part of the stipulatio  of the principal contract of sale conceded to be interstate commerce.\n But we are of opinion this decision was erroneous whether it be examined from the point of view of what was assumed to be the controlling effect of the ruling in the Waycross Case or whether it be tested by the elementary doctrines as to what constitutes interstate commerce. In the first place the Waycross Case concerned merely the right of the city of Waycross to collect a charge against a person who was carrying on a business of erecting lightning rods as the agent of one who had sold the rods in another state and shipped them to Waycross under an \n\n[247 U.S. 21, 24]\n\u00a0\n agreement after their arrival to erect them, The case turned exclusively upon the nature and character of the business of erecting lightning rods and the relevant or appropriate relation to interstate commerce of a stipulation in an interstate contract of sale of such rods providing for their erection when delivery under the sale was made. As it was determined that the business of erecting lightning rods bore no relevant or appropriate relation to the contract made for the sale of such rods, it was decided that the contract for the erection of the rods did not lose its local character simply because it was made a part of an interstate commerce contract for the sale of the rods any more than would a contract for materials with which to build a house cause the building of the house to be a transaction of interstate commerce and not local business. But the broad distinction which is established by the statement just made between what was decided in the Waycross Case and the question here presented does not rest alone upon the implication resulting from what was under consideration in that case, but moreover expressly results from the fact that in the Waycross Case through abundance of precaution attention was directed to the fact that the ruling there made was not controlling as to a case where the service to be done in a state as the result of an interstate commerce sale was essentially connected with the subject-matter of the sale, that is, might be made to appropriately inhere in the duty of performance. \n233 U.S. 23\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 578.\n As, in the second place, since the ruling in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, there has been no doubt that the interstate commerce power embraced that which is relevant or reasonably appropriate to the power granted, so also from such doctrine there can be no doubt that the right to make an interstate commerce contract includes in its very terms the right to incorporate into such contract provisions which are relevant and appropriate to the con- \n\n[247 U.S. 21, 25]\n\u00a0\n tract made. The only possible question open therefore is: Was the particular provision of the contract for the service of an engineer to assemble and erect the machinery in question at the point of destination and to practically test its efficiency before complete delivery relevant and appropriate to the interstate sale of the machinery? When the controversy is thus brought in last analysis to this issue there would seem to be no room for any but an affirmative answer. Generically this must be unless it can be said that an agreement to direct the assembling and supervision of machinery whose intrinsic value largely depends upon its being united and made operative as a whole is not appropriate to its sale. The consequence of such a ruling if made in this case would be particularly emphasized by a consideration of the functions of the machinery composing the plant which was sold, of its complexity, of the necessity of its aggregation and unison with mechanical skill and precision in order that the result of the contract of sale-the ice plant purchased-might come into existence. In its essential principle therefore the case is governed by Caldwell v. North Carolina, \n184 U.S. 622\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 229, Rearick v. Pennsylvania, \n203 U.S. 507\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 159, and Dozier v. Alabama, \n218 U.S. 124\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 49, 28 L. R. A. (N. S.) 264. In fact those cases were relied upon in the Waycross Case as supporting the contention that a mere agreement for the erection of lightning rods in a contract made concerning the shipment of such rods in interstate commerce caused the act of erection to be itself interstate commerce. But the basis upon which the cases were held to be not apposite, that is, the local characteristic of the work of putting up lighting rods, not only demonstrates beyond doubt the mistake concerning the ruling as to the Waycross Case which was below committed, but serves unerringly to establish the soundness of the distinction by which the particular question before us is brought within the reach of interstate commerce.\n Of course we are concerned only with the case before \n\n[247 U.S. 21, 26]\n\u00a0\n us, that is, with a contract inherently relating to and intrinsically dealing with the thing sold, the machinery and all its parts constituting the ice plant. This view must be borne in mind in order to make it clear that what is here said does not concern the subject passed on in General Railway Signal Co. v. Virginia, \n246 U.S. 500\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 360, 62 L. Ed . --, since in that case the work required to be done by the contract over and above its inherent and intrinsic relation to the subject-matter of the interstate commerce contract involved the performance of duties over which the state had a right to exercise control because of their inherent intrastate character. In fact the case last referred to when looked at from a broad point of view is but an illustration of the principle applied in the Waycross Case to the effect that that which was inherently intrastate did not lose its essential nature because it formed part of an interstate commerce contract to which it had no necessary relation. And this truth by a negative pregnant states the obverse view that that which is intrinsically interstate and immediately and inherently connected with interstate commerce is entitled to the protection of the Constitution of the United States resulting from that relation.\n It follows therefore that the judgment must be and it is reversed, and the case remanded to the court below for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n And it is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY dissents. \n\n\n\n"}}
