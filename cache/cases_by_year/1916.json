States Supreme Court\nABBOTT v. BROWN(1916)\nNo. 611\nArgued: April 13, 1916Decided: June 12, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 606, 607]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles B. Parkhill for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Wallace for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a final order discharging a writ of habeas corpus and remanding appellant to the custody of the United States marshal. The facts are as follows: Appellant was indicted in the United States district court for the southern district of Florida, at Tampa, \n\n[241 U.S. 606, 608]\n\u00a0\n for a violation of a section of the Criminal Code, and in the month of March, 1912, was tried and found guilty. On the 12th day of the same month he was sentenced to confinement in the penitentiary at Atlanta for the term of one year and six months. On the same day, and after passing the sentence, the court entered the following order: 'Ordered that court be adjourned in accordance with general rule No. 1, and all orders and other matters be entered as of the term. Thereupon court is adjourned as ordered.' After the entry of this order, Judge Locke, the district judge, went to Jacksonville, in the same district, and the deputy clerk noted on the minutes from day to day that court was open in accordance with general rule No. 1, after which he entered orders made from time to time by the court in vacation. On May 24, 1912, appellant filed a motion for a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, with several affidavits in support of it. On June 26 Judge Locke, at Jacksonville, granted this motion, and made a proper order, pursuant to which appellant was brought to trial on February 11, 1913, when the jury disagreed. He was again tried on March 13, 1914, and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Thereafter, and in February, 1915, the persons who had made the affidavits in support of the motion for a new trial were indicted for perjury, and appellant was indicted for subornation of perjury. Appellant demurred to this indictment and moved to quash it upon the ground that Judge Locke had no jurisdiction to grant a new trial because the motion was not filed within four days after the verdict. The demurrer and motion to quash were heard by the then presiding judge, who sustained the demurrer and quashed the indictment upon the ground that Judge Locke had no power or authority, after the making of the adjournment order of March 12, 1912, to vacate or set aside the sentence passed upon appellant on that date. \n\n[241 U.S. 606, 609]\n\u00a0\n Thereafter, and on March 20, 1915, the government procured a commitment to be issued upon the original judgment of conviction, and it is under this writ that appellant is now held in custody.\n Two questions arise: (1) Were the order for a new trial, and the trial proceedings had thereunder, null and void? (2) If not, should they nevertheless be so regarded as against appellant, because of what he did in obtaining the quashing of the indictment for subornation of perjury?\n Under the first head, counsel for appellee cites a rule of the district court, reading thus: 'Motions for new trials shall be made within four days after the entry of the verdict, during which time no judgment shall be entered, except by leave of court,' etc. We find in the record no evidence that there was such a rule; but, assuming we may take judicial notice of its existence, it was a mere regulation of practice, and a breach of it would be, at the utmost, a mere error of procedure, not affecting the jurisdiction.\n The principal insistence, and the ground upon which the court rested the decision that is now under review, is that the adjournment order of March 12 brought the term to an end, so far as criminal business was concerned, and left the court without jurisdiction to entertain the motion of May 24, or grant a new trial thereon, because a court of law cannot set aside or alter its final judgment after the expiration of the term at which it was rendered, except pursuant to an application made within the term. United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 67\n, 59 S. L. ed. 129, 135, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 16.\n The order of March 12 must be read in connection with the general rule to which it refers, and this must be interpreted in the light of the law regulating the terms and the business of the court. General rule No. 1 is as follows:\n'The law requiring the court to be always open for the transaction of certain kinds of business which may be \n\n[241 U.S. 606, 610]\n\u00a0\n transacted under the statutes, and under the orders of the judge, who may at the time be absent from the place in which the court is held, and which business can be transacted by the clerk under the orders of the judge, and is transacted from day to day in the court, it is ordered that, pending the temporary absence of the presiding judge of this district from the district, or the division of the district in which business is presented to be transacted, the clerk be present, either by himself or his deputy, daily, for the transaction of business, and upon such days as there is business to be transacted the court be opened, and that a record of the same be entered upon each of said days upon the minutes.'\n\n The provisions of law referred to are to be found in the Judicial Code (act of March 3, 1911, chap. 231, 36 Stat. at L. 1087, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1061), of which  76 divides the state of Florida into two districts, northern and southern, and provides: 'Terms of the district court for the southern district shall be held at Ocala on the third Monday in January; at Tampa on the second Monday in February; at Key West on the first Mondays in May and November; at Jacksonville on the first Monday in December; at Fernandina on the first Monday in April; and at Miami on the fourth Monday in April. The district court for the southern district shall be open at all times for the purpose of hearing and deciding causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.'\n Other sections to be considered are: Sec. 9 ( 574 and 638, Rev. Stat.), which declares that the district courts, as courts of admiralty and as courts of equity, shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing pleadings, issuing and returning process, and making interlocutory motions, orders, etc., preparatory to the hearing upon the merits;  10 ( 578, Rev. Stat.), requiring such courts to hold monthly adjournments of their regular terms for the trial of criminal causes when the business requires it; \n\n[241 U.S. 606, 611]\n\u00a0\n and  11 ( 581, Rev. Stat.), which declares that a special term of the district court may be held at the same place where any regular term is held, or at such other place in the district as the nature of the business may require, and at such time and upon such notice as may be ordered by the district judge, and that any business may be transacted at such special term which might be transacted at a regular term.\n The provision of  76, which requires the district court to be open at all times for the purpose of hearing and deciding admiralty causes, traces its origin to the act of February 23, 1847 (chap. 20, 9 Stat. at L. 131, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1061), which established the southern district of Florida, evidently for the especial purpose of disposing of admiralty business; and this particular provision was carried into the Revised Statutes as  575. It covers the hearing and deciding of admiralty causes, while the provision now found in  9, Judicial Code ( 574 and 638, Rev. Stat.), which originated in an act of August 23, 1842 (chap. 188,  5, 5 Stat. at L. 517, Comp. Stat. 1913,  976), relates to interlocutory proceedings 'preparatory to the hearing.'\n The statutory provisions referred to are designed to render the district courts readily accessible to applicants for justice in all branches of the jurisdiction; and while they require those courts to be always open only as courts of admiralty and as courts of equity, they permit 'special terms' to be held at any time for the transaction of any kind of business.\n The celebrated remark of Lord Eldon: 'The court of chancery is always open' (Temple v. Bank of England, 6 Ves. Jr. 770, 771), evidenced the great adaptability of the practice of that court to the needs of litigants; and modern legislation has shown a strong tendency to reform the practice of common-law courts by facilitating the transaction of their business in vacation. The sections we have quoted from the Judicial Code indicate a policy of avoiding the hardships consequent upon a closing \n\n[241 U.S. 606, 612]\n\u00a0\n of the court during vacations. The general rule in question was evidently designed to carry out this policy, and should receive a liberal interpretation consonant with its spirit: that is, as keeping the term alive, by adjournments from day to day, pending the temporary absence of the presiding judge, so that court might and should be actually opened upon such days as there was business of any character to be transacted. Thus interpreted, its effect was not different from that of the rule which this court, in Harlan v. McGourin, \n218 \nU.S. 442, 449\n, 450 S., 54 L. ed. 1101, 1105, 1106, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44, 21 Ann. Cas. 849, construed as keeping the court open from the beginning of one statutory term until the beginning of the next. Judge Locke so construed the general rule and the adjournment order made under it, when he entertained and granted the motion for new trial filed May 24, 1912, and we are satisfied that he committed no jurisdictional error in so doing. It is obvious that the order for a new trial necessarily vacated the sentence of March 12, 1912, and that the subsequent acquittal of appellant exhausted the power of the court under the first indictment.\n Nor is appellant, in our opinion, estopped to assert the jurisdiction of Judge Locke to entertain the motion for a new trial. The estoppel is sought to be based upon the position he is said to have taken in demurring to and moving to quash the indictment for subornation of perjury. The record shows, however, that the demurrer and motion were based upon the ground that the motion for new trial was not filed within four days after verdict. This was true in fact, but the court in effect held it not well founded in law; for it proceeded to sustain the demurrer and quash the indictment upon another ground, and one not taken by appellant, viz., that the adjournment order of March 12, 1912, brought the term to a conclusion and deprived Judge Locke of power to set aside the final judgment and sentence passed upon ap- \n\n[241 U.S. 606, 613]\n\u00a0\n pellant on that day. The fundamental ground of an estoppel is wanting, and we need not weigh other considerations that might operate against it.\n The judgment of conviction having been vacated by an order of the court, made within the scope of its power and jurisdiction, there remains no legal foundation for the commitment issued on March 20, 1915, and appellant is entitled to be discharged from custody.\n Final order reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Leave granted to present petition for rehearing herein within sixty days if counsel are so advised, on motion of Mr. Solicitor General Davis for the United States.\n June 12, 1916. \n\n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nACKERLIND v.

It is demanded by the claimant upon the following facts: The terms of such contracts are settled by the Bureau of Equipment. A requisition embodying the transaction is then sent to the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, which prepares a formal contract in writing in accordance with Rev. Stat.  3744, Comp. Stat. 1913,  6895. This section makes it the duty of the Secretaries of War, of the Navy, and of the Interior 'to cause and require every contract made by them severally on behalf of the government, or by their officers under them appointed to make such contracts, to be reduced to writing, and signed by the contracting parties.' In the present case the printed specifications upon which proposals were asked contained the clause: 'And further that in the event of a cargo arriving before the preceding cargo is discharged, twenty-four (24) hours' notice of arrival shall be given after discharge of each cargo before lay days commence in case of that next arriving.' The contractor \n\n[240 U.S. 531, 534]\n\u00a0\n objected to this clause upon satisfactory grounds, and it was agreed that it should be omitted. Through a clerical inadvertence, however, the clause was left in the requisition sent to the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, and the contract was drawn embodying it, and signed by the contractor on March 2, 1905, without careful reading, the precise form having been settled, as we have said. This mistake was discovered upon the arrival of several vessels at Cavite, on June 17, 1905, the attention of the Bureau of Equipment was called to it, and the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts was requested to make the necessary change, on June 23. That Bureau notified the contractor that the contract was amended by the omission of the clause. The government refuses to recognize the amendment, the court of claims dismissed the claim for reformation (49 Ct. Cl. 635), and the claimant appealed to this court.\n It hardly is denied and cannot be denied successfully that in a proper case reformation of a contract may be required against the United States notwithstanding the statute that we have quoted, as it may be required notwithstanding the provisions of the statute of frauds. William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Bldg. Co. v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 221, 230\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 70. It is the contract that has been made through the agent authorized to make it that is to be reduced to writing, and if a clerk or some other agent makes a mistake we perceive no reason why the writing should not be made to conform to the fact. The contract is not unlawful in the preliminary stage, or even void in a strict sense, but simply not to be enforced against the United States. United States v. New York & P. R. S. S. Co. \n239 U.S. 88\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 41. The contract is made with the principal and the several steps are to be regarded as if they all had been taken by him. Here the United States made the contract by the Bureau of Equipment, and by its mouth requested the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts to put it on paper and sign it. \n\n[240 U.S. 531, 535]\n\u00a0\n What the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts understood is immaterial; it simply followed the requisition of the Bureau of Equipment. There was a mistake made by a clerk in not striking out a printed clause from that requisition. It is as if a principal, after making the agreement, had taken a printed form and forgotten to draw his pen through the words. The failure of the contractor to read before signing an instrument the terms of which he had seen in print is not enough to debar him from seeking relief. Equitable Safety Ins. Co. v. Hearne, 20 Wall. 494, 22 L. ed. 398.\n The only ground for hesitation is the purely technical one that the court of claims, acting before the decision of William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Bldg. Co. v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 221, 232\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 70, and probably uncertain whether to send up facts or evidence, has not found in terms certain of the facts that we have stated. It has found that the acting chief of the Bureau of Equipment wrote an official letter stating them, and it has assumed them to be true in the decision that it delivered. We understand that they are not controverted if material, and therefore think it unnecessary to send the case back for further findings. The decree of the court of claims upon this part of the case will be reversed.\n The next question that arises concerns the amount of demurrage to be allowed under the contract as reformed. Undisputed terms of the instrument were: '6. The government guarantees but twenty (20) feet of water at coaling wharf, Sangley Point. 7. Cargo to be discharged at the rate of four hundred (400) tons per day for such part of cargo as may be necessary to discharge in the bay to enable a vessel of deep draft to go to the wharf, and six hundred (600) tons per day at wharf, Sundays and legal holidays excepted in each instance, or the government pays demurrage at the rate of eight (8) cents per ton per day on the net registered tonnage of the vessel for any detention caused by the government (through fault of \n\n[240 U.S. 531, 536]\n\u00a0\n its own) not discharging at the above-named rates, it being understood that twenty-four (24) hours' notice of arrival of each cargo under this charter shall be given the commandant before lay days commence.' (Then followed the clause stricken out by reformation.) '13. While an average daily discharge of four hundred (400) tons in the stream and six hundred ( 600) tons at the wharf is guaranteed, the commandant will be instructed to discharge the cargo as expeditiously as practicable with a view of exceeding these rates without working overtime.' It is found that one vessel went to the wharf drawing 22 feet and 6 inches, and it is argued that if one could, another could, and that, under paragraph 13, just quoted, the other vessels should have been docked at that draft, and thus have been enabled to deliver 200 tons more a day,-that being the difference between wharf and stream. If the argument is correct, it would give the claimant $2,217.44 demurrage under the contract as reformed. But as to this, it is enough to say that the court of claims stated that is did not find the fact of generally available depth of over 20 feet, and therefore it stands unproved in this court.\n The only other point argued is that the vessels concerned should not have been required to pay tonnage dues because the Philippine Tariff act of March 3, 1905, chap. 1408,  15, 33 Stat. at L. 928, 976, exempts from them 'a vessel belonging to or employed in the service of the government of the United States.' But it is a sufficient answer that the words do not mean every vessel that carries a ton or a cargo of coal for the government, but only one that is under the control of the United States, as explained in New Orleans-Belize Royal Mail & C. A. S. S. Co. v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 202, 206\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 76. The ground of the exemption is to prevent interference with government agencies. But an independent carrier, such as the contractor was in this case, is not such an agency, and is not employed in the service of the \n\n[240 U.S. 531, 537]\n\u00a0\n government within the meaning of the law. See Baltimore Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 \nU.S. 375, 382\n, 49 S. L. ed. 242, 244, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50. Upon the last two points the judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN WELL WORKS CO. v. LAYNE & BOWLER CO.(1916)\nNo. 376\nArgued: Decided: May 22, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 257, 258]\n\u00a0\n Mr. David A. Gates for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Paul Synnestvedt, Coke K. Burns, and J. M. Moore for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit begun in a state court, removed to the United States court, and then, on motion to remand by the plaintiff, dismissed by the latter court, on the ground that the cause of action arose under the patent laws of the United States, that the state court had no jurisdiction, and that therefore the one to which it was removed had none. There is a proper certificate and the case comes here direct from the district court.\n Of course the question depends upon the plaintiff's declaration. The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co. \n228 \nU.S. 22, 25\n, 57 S. L. ed. 716, 717, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410. That may be summed up in a few words. The plaintiff alleges that it owns, manufactures, and sells a certain pump, has or has applied for a patent for it, and that the pump is known as the best in the market. It then alleges that the defendants have falsely and maliciously libeled and slandered the plaintiff's title to the pump by stating that the pump and certain parts thereof are infringements upon the defendant's pump and certain parts thereof, and that without probable cause they have brought suits against some parties who are using the plaintiff's pump, and that they are threatening suits against all who use it. The allegation of the defendants' libel or slander is repeated in slightly varying form, but it all comes to statements to various people that the plaintiff was infringing the defendants' patent, and that the defendant \n\n[241 U.S. 257, 259]\n\u00a0\n would sue both seller and buyer if the plaintiff's pump was used. Actual damage to the plaintiff in its business is alleged to the extent of $50, 000, and punitive damages to the same amount are asked.\n It is evident that the claim for damages is based upon conduct; or, more specifically, language, tending to persuade the public to withdraw its custom from the plaintiff, and having that effect to its damage. Such conduct, having such effect, is equally actionable whether it produces the result by persuasion, by threats, or by falsehood (Moran v. Dunphy, 177 Mass. 485, 487, 52 L.R.A. 115, 83 Am. St. Rep. 289, 59 N. E. 125), and it is enough to allege and prove the conduct and effect, leaving the defendant to justify if he can. If the conduct complained of is persuasion, it may be justified by the fact that the defendant is a competitor, or by good faith and reasonable grounds. If it is a statement of fact, it may be justified, absolutely or with qualifications, by proof that the statement is true. But all such justifications are defenses, and raise issues that are no part of the plaintiff's case. In the present instance it is part of the plaintiff's case that it had a business to be damaged; whether built up by patents or without them does not matter. It is no part of it to prove anything concerning the defendants' patent, or that the plaintiff did not infringe the same-still less to prove anything concerning any patent of its own. The material statement complained of is that the plaintiff infringes,-which may be true notwithstanding the plaintiff's patent. That is merely a piece of evidence. Furthermore, the damage alleged presumably is rather the consequence of the threat to sue than of the statement that the plaintiff's pump infringed the defendants' rights.\n A suit for damages to business caused by a threat to sue under the patent law is not itself a suit under the patent law. And the same is true when the damage is caused by a statement of fact,-that the defendant has a \n\n[241 U.S. 257, 260]\n\u00a0\n patent which is infringed. What makes the defendants' act a wrong is its manifest tendency to injure the plaintiff's business; and the wrong is the same whatever the means by which it is accomplished. But whether it is a wrong or not depends upon the law of the state where the act is done, not upon the patent law, and therefore the suit arises under the law of the state. A suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action. The fact that the justification may involve the validity and infringement of a patent is no more material to the question under what law the suit is brought than it would be in an action of contract. If the state adopted for civil proceedings the saying of the old criminal law: the greater the truth, the greater the libel, the validity of the patent would not come in question at all. In Massachusetts the truth would not be a defense if the statement was made from disinterested malevolence. Rev. Laws, chap. 173,  91. The state is master of the whole matter, and if it saw fit to do away with actions of this type altogether, no one, we imagine, would suppose that they still could be maintained under the patent laws of the United States.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna dissents, being of opinion that the case involves a direct and substantial controversy under the patent laws. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARMOUR & CO. v.

Every lot of lard compound or of lard substitute, unless sold in bulk, shall be put up in pails or other containers holding one (1), three (3), or five (5), pounds net weight, or some whole multiple of these numbers, and not any fractions thereof. If the container be found deficient in weight additional lard, compound, or substitute, shall be furnished to the purchaser to make up the legal weight. The face label shall show the true name and grade of the product, the true net weight together with the true name and address of the producer or jobber. If other than leaf lard is used then the label shall show the kind, as 'Back Lard,' or 'Intestinal Lard.' Every lard substitute or lard compound shall also show, in a manner to be prescribed by the food commissioner, the ingredients of which it is composed, and each and every article shall be in conformity with, and further labeled in accordance with the requirements under the food laws of this state.' [Laws 1911, p. 355.]\n\n Violations of the act are made misdemeanors with a minimum and a maximum fine increased for subsequent offenses.\n In pursuance of the statute the state's attorney for the county of Cass filed an information against plaintiff in error for unlawfully offering for sale and selling to one E. F. Ladd a quantity of lard not in bulk, which was put up by the company and sold and delivered to Ladd in a pail which held more than 2 pounds and less than 3 \n\n[240 U.S. 510, 512]\n\u00a0\n pounds net weight of lard, to wit, 2 pounds and 6 ounces, which pail or container did not have or display on the face label thereof the true net weight of the lard in even pounds or whole multiples thereof, but expressed the weight of the lard in pounds and ounces.\n A demurrer to the information was overruled and the Armour Company pleaded not guilty. A stipulation was entered into waiving a jury trial and that the issues be tried by the court.\n The company was found guilty and adjudged to pay a fine of $100. The judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state and this writ of error was then allowed by its chief justice.\n The assignments of error attack the validity of the statute, specifying as grounds of the attack that the statute offends the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and also the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n Armour & Company is a New Jersey corporation. It is a packer of certain pork products and has packing plants where it produces lard as an incident to its business in Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska. It has no plant in North Dakota, but has a branch office establishment in the city of Fargo, in that state, to which its goods are shipped in carload lots to be distributed therefrom. The branch at Fargo is under the charge of a local manager.\n In October, 1911, the state food commissioner went to the company's establishment at Fargo and asked to purchase 3 pounds of lard. He was sold a pail containing 2 pounds and 6 ounces. It was upon this sale as a violation of the statute that the information was filed, and for which the Armour Company was convicted and sentenced.\n The supreme court considered the statute as but a development of other laws passed in the exercise of the \n\n[240 U.S. 510, 513]\n\u00a0\n police power of the state to secure to its inhabitants pure food and honest weights, questions which the court thought were 'inseparably allied and any argument advanced upon one applies equally to the other.' And the court said the law was drafted by the Pure Food Commission, it might be reasonably assumed, 'after twelve years of observation and study,' and, further, that 'the expert who drafted the law, the legislature who passed it, and the governor who approved it, all thought necessity existed for such a measure. If we did not agree with all those, we might well hesitate to say that there was absolutely no doubt upon the question, but in fact a majority of this court believes the law not only reasonable, but necessary, and this belief is founded upon the evidence in this case and upon facts of which this court can take judicial cognizance.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The court, by these remarks, expressed the test of a judicial review of legislation enacted in the exercise of the police power, and in view of very recent decisions it is hardly necessary to enlarge upon it. We said but a few days ago that if a belief of evils is not arbitrary, we cannot measure their extent against the estimate of the legislature, and there is no impeachment of such estimate in differences of opinion, however strongly sustained. And by evils, it was said, there was not necessarily meant some definite injury, but obstacles to a greater public welfare. Nor do the courts have to be sure of the precise reasons for the legislation, or certainly know them, or be convinced of the wisdom or adequacy of the laws. Rast v. Van Deman & L. Co.; Tanner v. Little, \n240 U.S. 342\n, --, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 370, 379. It only remains to apply to the present case the principles so announced.\n Lard is a very useful product and its many purposes are set forth in the testimony. It was originally sold in the state only in tierces and tubs; that is, in bulk. A demand arose for smaller and more convenient packages and the \n\n[240 U.S. 510, 514]\n\u00a0\n Armour Company and other packers responded to that demand and put their lard in 3, 5, and 10-pound pails, gross weight, the net weight of lard at first having no indication, but subsequently, in obedience to the state laws, being indicated by labels, and in the present case by a small label at 2 pounds and 6 ounces. The practice of selling by gross weight is a continuation of the practice of selling by bulk.\n The Armour Company asserts an inviolable right in the practice as convenient and useful and free from deception. But experience does not justify such unqualified praise. The practice has its advantages, no doubt, but it is the observation of the officers of the state that it conceals from buyers their exact purchases,-there is confusion as to what the price paid compensates, whether lard or tin container.\n The Armour Company contests this conclusion and contends that the label upon the package, put on in observance of a law of the state passed in 1907,2 shows the net weight of the lard, and protects the consumer from imposition while it preserves to the company a useful method of packing and a necessary freedom of business with the public. To this we reply the law of 1907 was deemed necessary to protect the purchaser against the concealment in the method of the packers, the amount of lard not being indicated. Supposedly the requirement was not adequate, and the law of 1911 was passed. However, with a comparison of the laws we have nothing to \n\n[240 U.S. 510, 515]\n\u00a0\n do, nor need we even consider, as the supreme court considered, with some reluctance, that the label used by the company was a scant compliance with the law of 1907, if not an evasion of it. We need only deal with the law under review and the justification for its adoption. Evils attended the method of the company which the Food Commission of the state thought should be redressed, and which the legislature reasonably believed were definite, and not fanciful, and in this belief passed the law. And the belief being of that character removes the law, as we have already said, from judicial condemnation; and besides, there is nothing in the testimony inconsistent with it.\n The testimony of the company was directed at great length to show the advantages of selling in containers over selling in bulk, and the expense to the company of the former, and the additional expense which the law would require. And meeting the objection that the company fixed the price of the lard by the gross weight of the package,-in other words, as through there were 3 pounds instead of 2 pounds, 6 ounces, it was replied that by so doing there was no profit to the company and only a reimbursement of the cost of the tin container and extra cost of putting up the lard in that style of package.\n But this does not justify the practice of the company nor establish the invalidity of the law of the state. The advantages are in a sense made a snare, and the testimony means no more than that the packer has built up a trade on a system of gross weight which enables it to practice a kind of deception on the purchaser that he is getting 3 pounds of lard when he is only getting 2 pounds, 6 ounces, and enables the packer to pay for the container. The evil of the transaction is not in the latter, but in the former,-that is, in the deception. The correction of the statute is that the lard and the container shall be unequivocally distinguished, and the purchaser have the \n\n[240 U.S. 510, 516]\n\u00a0\n direct assurance of the quantity of lard he is receiving, knowledge of its price and the cost of the container to him,-a means of estimating his purchase free from disguises or the necessity of an arithmetical estimate of what he is getting or paying for upon the market fluctuations of lard and tin. This may involve a change of packing by the company and the cost of that change, but this is a sacrifice the law can require to protect from the deception of the old method. The law is allied in principle, as the supreme court of the state observed, to regulations in the interest of honest weights and measures. It involves no giving up of what the company has a right to retain, and the cost of the container as well after change as now can be cast upon the purchaser, he, however, being able to determine if it is worth the price he has to pay for it.\n There are advantages undoubtedly in packing lard in pails,-advantages to the packer and the consumer; but the advantages are not on account of selling by gross instead of by net weight. In other words, all of the advantages will be retained by a compliance with the provisions of the law; that is, by putting up the lard in 1, 3, or 5-pound packages, net weight, or some multiple of those numbers. It is in the testimony that the packing company furnishes lard in net-weight pails to Park & Tilford, of New York city; that is, in weights of 3, 5, and 10 pounds, and has been doing so for a few years.\n The equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment is invoked by the Armour Company and the specification is that the law under review 'arbitrarily and without reasonable ground therefor singles out lard from all food products' which are sold in packages, such as 'prints of butter, packages of coffee, boxes of crackers, and the endless number of other products sold in package form are not included, and no natural and reasonable \n\n[240 U.S. 510, 517]\n\u00a0\n ground for excluding them and in singling out lard has been suggested.'\n The range of discretion that a state possesses in classifying objects of legislation we may be excused from expressing, in view of very recent decisions. The power may be determined by degrees of evil, or exercised in cases where detriment is specially experienced. Carroll v. Greenwich Ins. Co. \n199 \nU.S. 401, 411\n, 50 S. L. ed. 246, 250, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66; Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, \n226 \nU.S. 157, 161\n, 57 S. L. ed. 164, 169, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66. The law of Dakota does not exceed this power.\n It is objected that the law violates the commerce clause of the Constitution. This is certainly not true of the sale to Ladd. It was distinctly by retail and in the package of retail, not in the package of importation. And it is to such retail sales the statute is directed. It does not attempt to regulate the transportation to the state.\n Nor do we think that the law is repugnant to the pure food and drugs act of June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 768, chap. 3915, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8717). That act is directed against the adulteration and misbranding of articles of food transported in interstate commerce. The state statute has no such purpose; it is directed to the manner of selling at retail, which is in no way repugnant to the Federal law (Rast v. Van Deman & L. Co. \n240 U.S. 342\n, 60 L. Ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 370), and the operation of that law is in no way displaced or interfered with.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] [This quotation is taken from the original opinion of the state court in this case.

A draft for the purchase price of the corn was mailed to Kansas City, Missouri, accompanied with the bill of lading, indorsed over to the order of the Fisher Grain Company, and on the presentation of this draft to the Grain Company at Kansas City, Missouri, while the car was yet in transit, it \n\n[241 U.S. 371, 373]\n\u00a0\n paid the same and became the possessor and owner of the bill of lading. On the 24th of September the Grain Company surrendered to an agent of the Santa Fe at Kansas City, Missouri, the Yanka bill of lading which it had thus acquired, and took in exchange for it another bill, consigning the identical car to their own order at Elk Falls, Kansas, a place on the Santa Fe road, with a direction, however, to notify at Elk Falls the Nevling Elevator Company. This bill of lading was dated the same day as the original bill for which it was exchanged; that is, September 21st, although it was in fact only signed and issued on the 24th of that month; and although on its face it treated the car as being at Kansas City, in reality the car was in transit from yanka, not having yet reached Topeka.\n Harold, the defendant in error, a grain dealer at Wichita, Kansas, who had sold on September 15th a carload of corn to Shoe & Jackson at Elk Falls, to be shipped or delivered in a stated number of days, bought the carload of corn described by the bill of lading issued at Kansas City, and, paying a draft for the purchase price drawn by Fisher Grain Company, with the bill annexed, he became the owner of the bill, and directed that delivery of the corn be made to Shoe & Jackson. The car from Yanka had then not yet been delivered to the Santa Fe at Topeka, having reached that point only on the 28th of September, on which day it was offered to the Santa Fe for carriage and delivery at Elk Falls. Finding that the car was in bad order, the delivery was declined, and the car turned back to the Union Pacific. That road, discovering that the damage was such that the car could not be repaired while it was loaded, sent it to an elevator, transferred the grain to another car, S. P. No. 85,721, and turned that car over to the Santa Fe. The new car, however, did not contain the exact quantity of grain originally shipped from Yanka, as one of the defects in the old car was a leaky door, and \n\n[241 U.S. 371, 374]\n\u00a0\n several hundred pounds of the corn had been lost in transit. The car was promptly carried by the Santa Fe to Elk Falls and offered for delivery, but as the period for the fulfilment by Harold of his contract with Shoe & Jackson had elapsed, and there had been a decline in the market price of corn, the latter refused to take the car. Thereupon this suit against the Santa Fe was commenced by Harold to recover the loss which he had suffered by the alleged unreasonable delay in delivery at Elk Falls, consisting of three items: first, the difference between the price at which the corn had been contracted to be sold to Shoe & Jackson and the market price at the date the car was offered for delivery; second, the amount of the freight paid on the corn which had been lost; and third, a reasonable attorney's fee which it was alleged a statute of the state of Kansas authorized to be recovered in case of delay of a carrier in the delivery of grain.\n In its defense the company alleged the shipment over the Union Pacific from Yanka, averred that the corn was received by it at Topeka in order to complete the transportation to Elk Falls, and charged that, by a condition of the bill of lading issued at Kansas City, as the delay had been wholly caused by the Union Pacific, there was no liability on the part of the Santa Fe, and that, besides, that company was not liable, because of a failure to give a notice of claim in compliance with a condition which was also contained in the Kansas City bill of lading. There was judgment in the trial court for the plaintiff, and the judgment of the court below, affirming such action, is the one now under review.\n The court, after referring to the bill of lading sued on (the one issued at Kansas City), and after stating that 'the shipment intended to be described in the bill of lading originated at Yanka, Nebraska, on the Union Pacific Railway,' proceeded to state the facts which we have recapitulated, and which had been admitted in \n\n[241 U.S. 371, 375]\n\u00a0\n evidence without objection. In substance conceding that if the facts stated were made the test of the rights of the parties the judgment under review was wrong, because there had been, as a matter of fact, no unreasonable delay in delivering the corn by the Santa Fe, it was held that the judgment rendered was right, since the plaintiff below, as the purchaser of a bill of lading for value, had a right to rely upon the face of the bill, to treat the corn as having been received by the carrier at Kansas City on the date the bill of lading was issued, and therefore to recover for the unreasonable delay in delivery which necessarily would result from excluding from view the facts concerning the movement of the corn from Yanka, Nebraska, and the date of its delivery at Topeka to the Santa Fe. The essence of the opinion was aptly summed up in the syllabus which preceded it, drawn by the court, which is as follows:\n'1. The rule which invests the innocent holder of a bill of lading with rights not available to the shipper, declared in Wichita Sav. Bank v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. 20 Kan. 519; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Hutchings, 78 Kan. 758, 99 Pac. 230; and Hutchings v. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. (Sealy v. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co.) 84 Kan. 479, 41 L.R.A.(N.S.) 500, 114 Pac. 1079, is followed in a case where the plaintiff purchased corn described in a bill of lading, and paid the shipper's draft attached to the bill in the usual course of business.' [93 Kan. 456, 144 Pac. 823.]\n\n In addition, the allowance of the attorney's fees under the Kansas statute was upheld on the ground that the statute was within the legitimate police power of the state to enact, and not repugnant to the state or Federal Constitution.\n The motion to dismiss, referred to at the outset, is based on the ground that the action of the court involved no question of interstate, but purely one of intrastate, commerce. But this disregards the fact that the bill of lading which was sued upon was an interstate commerce bill \n\n[241 U.S. 371, 376]\n\u00a0\n covering a shipment from Kansas City, Missouri, to Elk Falls, Kansas. True, it is urged that that bill of lading is not the test of whether there is jurisdiction, because it was shown that in reality the shipment was an intrastate one from Topeka, Kansas, to Elk Falls in that state. But this assumes that although the judgment rests upon the conception that the previous movement of the corn from Yanka could not be considered as against the plaintiff because he was an innocent third holder of the bill of lading issued at Kansas City, nevertheless, for the purpose of determining whether jurisdiction exists, the facts as to the shipment from Yanka must be treated as relevant. Leaving aside, however, this contradiction, and considering the facts as to the movement of the grain from its inception, we are of opinion that, from that point of view, it was clearly established that the grain moved in a continuous interstate commerce shipment from the date of its departure from Yanka to the termination of the transit at Elk Falls, and that the delivery of the car to the Santa Fe at Topeka for further movement was therefore not a new and distinct shipment in intrastate commerce. We reach this conclusion in view of the place of business of the Fisher Grain Company (Kansas City, Missouri), of the fact that there was no person at Topeka to whom the grain was consigned, of the indorsement of the bill of lading to the Fisher Grain Company, and the annexing to it of a draft drawn on that company at Kansas City for the purchase price, and because the order on the face of the bill of lading to 'notify C. V. Fisher Grain Company, care of Santa Fe for shipment' made it apparent that it was not contemplated that the interstate shipment should terminate at Topeka, but that the car should move on as the result of such direction as might be given while it was in transit by the Fisher Grain Company at Kansas City, Missouri.\n But, further, it is said that granting there was a Federal \n\n[241 U.S. 371, 377]\n\u00a0\n question, as it was not asserted of relied upon until application for a rehearing, it is not open for consideration. The answer, however, is that the court considered and disposed of the question by holding that the facts which were otherwise pertinent and controlling must be put out of view because the interstate commerce bill of lading in the hands of Harold, the purchaser, was in fact negotiable paper, giving greater rights to such purchaser than could be enjoyed by the shipper, or by the one from whom he had acquired the bill. It is obvious, therefore, that this was a decision of a Federal question which we have power to dispose of as such, and we come to consider it.\n That the local rule applied by the court below was in direct conflict with the general commercial law on the subject, as repeatedly settled by this court, is plain. Shaw v. North Pennsylvania R. Co. (Shaw v. Merchants' Nat. Bank) \n101 U.S. 557\n, 25 L. ed. 892; Pollard v. Vinton, \n105 U.S. 7\n, 26 L. ed. 998; St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Knight, \n122 U.S. 79\n, 30 L. ed. 1077, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1132; Friedlander v. Texas & P. R. Co. \n130 U.S. 416\n, 32 L. ed. 991, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 570; Missouri P. R. Co. v.

Rep. 803.\n Nothing could better point out the irreconcilable conflict between the local doctrine applied by the court below and the general law, as illustrated in the cases cited, than does the following statement in the opinion in the Roses Case, last cited (p. 665):\n'A pledgee to whom a bill of lading is given as security gets the legal title to the goods and the right of possession only if such is the intention of the parties, and that intention is open to explanation. Inquiry into the transaction in which the bill originated is not precluded because it came into the hands of persons who may have innocently paid value for it.'\n\n Whether, in the absence of legislation by Congress, the attributing to an interstate bill of lading of the exceptional and local characteristic applied by the court below, in \n\n[241 U.S. 371, 378]\n\u00a0\n conflict with the general commercial rule, constituted a direct burden on interstate commerce, and was therefore void, need not now be considered. This is so because, irrespective of that question, and, indeed, without stopping to consider the general provisions of the act to regulate commerce, it is not disputable that what is known as the Carmack amendment to the act to regulate commerce (act of June 29, 1906, chap. 3591,  7, 34 Stat. at L. 593, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8592) was an assertion of the power of Congress over the subject of interstate shipments, the duty to issue bills of lading, and the responsibilities thereunder, which, in the nature of things, excluded state action. Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 \nU.S. 491, 505\n, 506 S., 57 L. ed. 314, 319, 320, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Harriman, \n227 \nU.S. 657, 671\n, 672 S., 57 L. ed. 690, 697, 698, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397; Boston & M. R. Co. v. Hooker, \n233 \nU.S. 97, 110\n, 58 S. L. ed. 868, 875, L.R.A. 1915B, 450, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 593; Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Robinson, \n233 \nU.S. 173, 180\n, 58 S. L. ed. 901, 905, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 556; Cleveland, & St. L. R. Co. v.

Rep. 541.\n Indeed, in the argument it is frankly conceded that, as the subject of a carrier's liability for loss or damage to goods moving in interstate commerce under a bill of lading is embraced by the Carmack amendment, state legislation on that subject has been excluded. It is insisted, however, that this does not exclude liability for error in the bill of lading purporting to cover an interstate shipment, because 'Congress has legislated relative to the one, but not relative to the other.' But this ignores the view expressly pointed out in the previous decisions dealing with the Carmack amendment, that its prime object was to bring about a uniform rule of responsibility as to interstate commerce and interstate commerce bills of lading,-a purpose which would be wholly frustrated if the proposition relied upon were upheld. The principal subject of responsibility embraced by the act of Congress carried with it necessarily the incidents thereto. See the subject aptly and clearly illustrated by St. Louis & S. \n\n[241 U.S. 371, 379]\n\u00a0\n F. R. Co. v. Woodruff Mills, 105 Miss. 214, 62 So. 171, where a statute of the state of Mississippi, accomplishing the very result applied by the court below, was decided to be no longer applicable to interstate commerce because of the taking possession by Congress of the field by virtue of the amendment referred to.\n As it follows from what we have said that the court below erred in applying the local law to the interstate commerce shipment under consideration, its judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATLANTIC CITY R. CO. v. PARKER(1916)\nNo. 111\nArgued: November 16, 1916Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 56, 57]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas E. French, Samuel H. Richards, and Charles Heebner for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 56, 58]\n\u00a0\n Mr. David O. Watkins for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action brought by the defendant in error to recover for the loss of an arm crushed while he was coupling a tender to a car. There is no dispute that the case is governed by the acts of Congress-the Safety Appliance Act of March 2, 1893, chap. 196,  2, 8, 27 Stat. at L. 531, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8606, 8612, \n\n[242 U.S. 56, 59]\n\u00a0\n and the Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, chap. 149,  3, 4, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8659, 8660. The facts material here are few. The engine had backed for the purpose of coupling with the car and had failed to couple automatically by impact. Thereupon the plaintiff, noticing that the drawhead was not in line with the one on the engine, put in his arm for the purpose of straightening it and thus making the coupling possible, and was caught. An exception was taken to the refusal of a ruling that no negligence was shown on the part of the railroad company, but the court of errors and appeals affirmed the judgment of the court below. 87 N. J. L. 148, 93 Atl. 574.\n If there was evidence that the railroad failed to furnish such 'couplers coupling automatically by impact' as the statute requires ( Johnson v. Southern P. Co. \n196 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 19 S., 49 L. ed. 363, 369, 370, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158, 17 Am. Neg. Rep. 412), nothing else needs to be considered. We are of opinion that there was enough evidence to go to the jury upon that point. No doubt there are arguments that the jury should have decided the other way. Some lateral play must be allowed to drawheads, and, further, the car was on a curve, which, of course, would tend to throw the coupler out of line. But the jury were warranted in finding that the curve was so slight as not to affect the case, and in regarding the track as, for this purpose, a straight line. If couplers failed to couple automatically upon a straight track, it at least may be said that a jury would be werranted in finding that a lateral play so great as to prevent coupling was not needed, and that, in the absence of any explanation believed by them, the failure indicated that the railroad had not fully complied with the law.

Stat. 1913,  1215, on the ground that it involves the construction and application of the Constitution of the United States. The plaintiff in error was indicted for placing letters in the mail for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud devised by him, in violation of  215 of the Criminal Code, act of March 4, 1909, chap. 321, 35 Stat. at L. 1088, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,385. There were twelve counts, on seven of which, each relating to a different letter, he was found guilty. He was sentenced to five year's imprisonment on each count, the periods being concurrent, not cumulative, and also to a fine of $1,000 on each or $7,000 in all. The grounds for coming to this court are, first, that  215 of the Criminal Code is beyond the power of Congress, as applied to what may be a mere incident of a fraudulent scheme that itself is outside the jurisdiction of Congress to deal with; and second, that if it makes the deposit of each letter a separate offense, subject to such punishment as it received in this case, it imposes cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines.\n These contentions need no extended answer. The overt act of putting a letter into the postoffice of the United States is a matter that Congress may regulate. Ex parte Jackson, \n96 U.S. 727\n, 24 L. ed. 877. Whatever the limits to the power, it may forbid any such acts done in furtherance of a scheme that it regards as contrary to public policy, whether it can forbid the scheme or not.

Hunter Boyd, Jr., for plaintiff in error. \n\n[240 U.S. 620, 621]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. H. Conaway for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 620, 622]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Hostetter, the defendant in error, a resident of West Virginia, sued in a justice's court in that state for wages due him by the railroad company, now plaintiff in error. The defense was that the wages had been paid by the railroad company as the result of a garnishment proceeding taken against it in the state of Virginia, where it was suable, to enforce a judgmenrt rendered in Virginia against Hostetter when he resided in that state, and after a domiciliary service on him. The case went from the justice's court for a de novo trial to the intermediate court of Marion county, where, as the result of a verdict against the railroad company, it was condemned to pay again, the court holding that the Virginia garnishment proceeding was not entitled to be enforced as against Hostetter under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States because he was not served with process in such proceeding, he then residing in West Virginia, although extrajudicial notice was given him by the railroad company of the proceeding. The case is here on writ of error to review the judgment of the court below, affirming that of the intermediate court, and whether proper force was given to the full faith and credit clause is the question for decision.\n It is true that in the argument for the defendant in error various suggestions are made as to the insufficiency of the record concerning the existence of the Virginia judgment upon which reliance on the full faith and credit \n\n[240 U.S. 620, 623]\n\u00a0\n clause was placed, on the ground that the record contains mere recitals with reference to the judgment, etc., etc. For the sake of brevity we do not stop to review these suggestions, although we have considered them all, since we think they are not only without merit, but many of them are in effect frivolous, because in our opinion the record suffices to establish the facts which were stated by the court below as the basis for its judgment, and which we briefly recapitulate as follows:\n The plaintiff in July 1911, resided in Clifton Forge, Virginia, and was indebted to one Wagner in the sum of $35, for which debt Wagner obtained a judgment against him in a justice's court of Virginia, based upon a summons served 'on said plaintiff . . . by delivering a copy thereof to the wife the plaintiff at his usual place of abode. . . . Said record further shows . . . that on the 17th day of September, 1912, a garnishee summons was issued by H. H. Harlow, a justice of the peace in the city of Staunton, Virginia, . . . which garnishee summons was directed against the said Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company . . . charging that it had money, or other personal estate, in its possession or control belonging to the said Hostetter, and requiring the said railroad company to appear . . . to answer said garnishment or suggestion; . . . and that on the 3d day of October, 1912, said justice last above named rendered a judgment against the said Hostetter and the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company in favor of the said Wagner in the sum of $38.40, with interest . . . In this garnishment or suggestion proceeding, no notice or process of any kind was given to or served upon the said Hostetter, he then being a resident of this state [West Virginia], and had been such resident for more than a year previous to the date of the institution of the garnishment proceeding. From this said last-named judgment the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company \n\n[240 U.S. 620, 624]\n\u00a0\n appealed to the corporation court of the city of Staunton, and this appeal was heard and passed upon by said court on the 27th day of February, 1913. So far as the record shows, no notice of such proceeding in the courts of Virginia was given to the defendant until on or about the 14th day of February, 1913, when the said railroad company did notify, in writing, the said Hostetter, of the pendency of the said garnishment proceedings on appeal in said corporation court. . . . It is not contended that any formal notice was given to said Hostetter of the garnishment proceedings for the reason that the statute of Virginia under which said proceedings was instututed does not require notice to be given a nonresident of that state of the pendency of the garnishment or suggestion.'\n Although the railroad had paid in virtue of the judgment rendered in the garnishment proceeding taken as above stated, the court, agreeing in opinion, as we have said, with the trial court, held that the garnishment proceeding and the judgment in it were no protection to the railroad company because there was no power in the Virginia courts to garnishee in that state in the hands of the railroad a sum of money due by it to an employee domiciled in another state without service on such employee in Virginia, and that the full faith and credit clause imposed no duty to enforce a judgment in garnishment proceedings affected with the want of power stated.\n In view of the decisions of this court dealing with the exact situation here presented and expressly holding that the principles upon which the court below based its action were erroneous and could not be upheld consistently with the duty to apply and enforce the full faith and credit clause, we need do no more than cite the cases referred to.

Hamilton for plaintiff in error. \n\n[242 U.S. 295, 296]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Morse Ives for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action for personal injuries, brought under the Hours of Service Act, March 4, 1907, chap. 2939,  2, 34 Stat. at L. 1415, 1416, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8677, 8678, and the Employers' Liability Act, April 22, 1908, chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657. There is a count alleging an improper construction of tracks, and there are others, which alone are of importance here, alleging that the plaintiff was kept on duty for more than sixteen hours, and subsequently (we may take it in fact to have been fourteen hours later) put on duty again and injured be- \n\n[242 U.S. 295, 297]\n\u00a0\n cause he was so exhausted as to be unable to protect himself in the work that he was attempting to perform. At the trial the judge instructed the jury that if they found that the defendant had been guilty of the breach of duty alleged, and that the breach proximately contributed to the plaintiff's injury, then they should not consider negligence, if any, on the part of the plaintiff, in determining the amount of the plaintiff's damages, if any. In other words, under  3 of the Employers' Liability Act, he allowed a violation of a statute enacted for the safety of employees to be found to exclude contributory negligence, although at the time of the accident the violation was fourteen hours old.\n It is not important to give the particulars of the accident. The plaintiff was a freight conductor, and was intending to cut a car with a hot box out of a train. He stood on the running board at the rear of an engine on a side track until it drifted abreast of the car standing on the main track, when he stepped off and was very badly hurt.\n The first step in the railroad's real defense was that the plaintiff was not kept on duty more than sixteen hours,-a proposition that there was substantial evidence to maintain. But that having been overthrown by the verdict, it contends that the injury must happen during the violation of law, or at least that the Hours of Service Law fixes the limit of possible connection between the overwork and the injury at ten hours by the provision that an employee, after being continuously on duty for sixteen hours, shall have at least ten consecutive hours off. It also objects that the plaintiff, if feeling incompetent to work, should have notified the defendant. But no reason can be given for limiting liability to injuries happening while the violation of law is going on, and as to the ten hours, the statute fixes only a minimum, and a minimum for rest after work no longer than allowed. It has nothing to do with the \n\n[242 U.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n question of the varying rest needed after work extended beyond the lawful time. In this case there was evidence that whether technically on duty or not, the plaintiff had been greatly overtaxed before the final strain of more than sixteen hours, and that, as a physical fact, it was far from impossible that the fatigue should have been a cause proximately contributing to all that happened. If so, then by the Employers' Liability Act,  3 and 4, questions of negligence and assumption of risk disappear.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALTIMORE & O.R.

He brought suit under the Federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908 (chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657), in a state court and recovered a verdict. Exceptions were taken to certain refusals to rule. The court of appeals of Maryland affirmed the judgment of the court below. 124 Md. 411, 92 Atl. 1060\n\n\n It appeared at the trial that, although the pit was of modern construction and well adapted to the purpose for which it was canstructed, it was not protected by a guard rail. There was testimony that at the time of the accident certain lights alleged to have been provided about the pit were not lighted; that it had been raining; and that the top of the water was covered to some extent with ashes, which made it constructed, it was not protected by a guard pit from solid ground. It was admitted that Whitacre was engaged in interstate commerce. The defenses relied upon were assumption of risk and denial of negligence.\n The defendant (plaintiff in error) requested a peremptory instruction in its favor, on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence to entitle the plaintiff to recover. The appellate court was unanimous in holding that the trial court had properly left the case to the jury. No \n\n[242 U.S. 169, 171]\n\u00a0\n clear and palpable error is shown which would justify us in disturbing that ruling. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Padgett, \n236 \nU.S. 668, 673\n, 59 S.

It was brought in the district court for the northern district of Texas December 27, 1915, was dismissed by that court for want of jurisdiction, and is here upon a direct appeal under  238 of the Judical Code [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1215].\n The bill alleges that the plaintiff, the trustee under the mortgage, is a New York corporation and 'a citizen of said state;' that the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, one of the defendants, is a corporation created and existing under the laws of the United States, has its principal place of business and its principal operating and general offices in the northern district of Texas, and 'is a resident and inhabitant' of that district; that the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company, the other de- \n\n[241 U.S. 295, 302]\n\u00a0\n fendant, is a Louisiana corporation and 'a citizen of said state;' that one of the acts of Congress under which the Texas & Pacific Railway Company was created and now exists (act March 3, 1871, chap. 122,  1, 16 Stat. at L. 573) provides that such company 'by that name . . . shall be able to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, defend and be defended, in all courts of law and equity within the United States;' that under that act and designated amendatory and supplemental acts of Congress (May 2, 1872, chap. 132, 17 Stat. at L. 59; March 3, 1873, chap. 257, 17 Stat. at L. 598; June 22, 1874, chap. 406, 18 Stat. at L. 197) said company came to own and hold on February 1, 1888, certain railroad properties and interests in Texas and Louisiana; that on that date said company, 'acting in pursuance of due authority conferred upon it by said acts of Congress,' the relevant portions of which are copied into the bill, and the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company, acting in pursuance of authority conferred upon it by the laws of Louisiana, executed and delivered the mortgage in suit covering these railroad properties and interests, a substantial part of which is situate in the northern district of Texas; that the mortgage was duly filed and recorded in the Department of the Interior pursuant to such acts of Congress; that the mortgagors have defaulted in the performance of the terms and conditions of the mortgage, and that the suit involves the requisite jurisdictional amount and 'arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States.'\n By a motion to dismiss, the Texas & Pacific Railway Company challenged the jurisdiction of the district court upon the grounds that the act of January 28, 1915, chap. 22,  5, 38 Stat. at L. 803, provides: 'No court of the United States shall have jurisdiction of any action or suit by or against any railroad company upon the ground that said railroad company was incorporated under an act of Congress;' and that, apart from the Texas & Pacific Rail- \n\n[241 U.S. 295, 303]\n\u00a0\n way Company's incorporation under congressional enactments, the suit is not one arising under the Constitution or any law of the United States, and is not one between citizens of different states. The motion was sustained and the bill was dismissed as to both defendants.\n The plaintiff insists that, in refusing to entertain the suit, the district court erred because (1) the provision before quoted from  1 of the act of March 3, 1871, enables the Texas & Pacific Railway Company to sue and be sued in any court of law or equity within the United States; (2) the bill shows that the suit is one arising under the laws of the United States apart from the incorporation of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company under acts of Congress, and therefore the act of January 28, 1915, is not controlling, and (3) the bill shows that the suit is between citizens of different states.\n\n 1. \nUpon reading  1 of the act of 1871 it is plain that the words 'by that name . . . shall be able to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, defend and be defended, in all courts of law and equity within the United States' were not intended in themselves to confer jurisdiction upon any court. As the context shows, Congress was not then concerned with the jurisdiction of courts, but with the faculties and powers of the corporation which it was creating; and evidently all that was intended was to render this corporation capable of suing and being sued by its corporate name in any court of law or equity-Federal, state, or territorial-whose jurisdiction as otherwise competently defined was adequate to the occasion. Had there been a purpose to take suits by and against the corporation out of the usual jurisdictional restrictions relating to the nature of the suit, the amount in controversy, and the venue, it seems reasonable to believe that Congress would have expressed that purpose in altogether different words. The case of Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, 61, 85, 3 L. ed. 38, 44, is well in point. A \n\n[241 U.S. 295, 304]\n\u00a0\n provision in the act incorporating the bank (chap. 10,  3, 1 Stat. at L. 191), much like that here relied upon, was invoked as in itself entitling the bank to sue in a circuit court of the United States, but that view was rejected in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall, wherein it was said:\n'That act creates the corporation, gives it a capacity to make contracts and to acquire property, and enables it 'to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in courts of record, or any other place whatsoever.' This power, if not incident to a corporation, is conferred by every incorporating act, and is not understood to enlarge the jurisdiction of any particular court, but to give a capacity to the corporation to appear, as a corporation, in any court which would, by law, have cognizance of the cause, if brought by individuals. If jurisdiction is given by this clause to the Federal courts, it is equally given to all courts having original jurisdiction, and for all sums, however small they may be.'\n\n Afterwards, when the second bank of the United States was established, a provision was inserted in the incorporating act (chap. 44,  7, 3 Stat. at L. 266), enabling the bank to sue and be sued 'in all state courts having competent jurisdiction, and in any circuit court of the United States;' and in Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 6 L. ed. 204, it was held (pp. 816-818) that this provision, unlike that in the prior act, amounted to an express grant of jurisdiction to the circuit courts, and (pp. 823 et seq.) was within the power of Congress under the Constitution. It was in the light of these differing precedents in legislation and of the resulting difference in their interpretation that Congress framed the act of 1871. While that act does not literally follow either precedent, its words have the same generality and natural import as did those in the earlier bank act, and this strengthens the conclusion that Congress intended thereby to give to the Texas & \n\n[241 U.S. 295, 305]\n\u00a0\n Pacific Railway Company only a general capacity to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity whose jurisdiction as otherwise defined was appropriate to the occasion, and not to establish an exceptional or privileged jurisdiction.\n\n 2. \nUnder the Constitution Congress undoubtedly possesses power to invest the subordinate Federal courts with original jurisdiction of all suits at law or in equity arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, and, if the act of February 13, 1801, chap. 4,  11, 2 Stat. at L. 89, be not noticed because of its early repeal ( chap. 8,  1, 2 Stat. at L. 132), it is true, as sometimes has been said,1 that this power was broadly exercised for the first time by the act of March 3, 1875, chap. 137,  1, 18 Stat. at L. 470. By that act Congress in express terms gave the circuit courts original jurisdiction, concurrent with the courts of the several states, of all suits of that nature, where the value of the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, was in excess of $ 500, and this jurisdiction remained with the circuit courts until January 1, 1912, when they were abolished, save as the act of March 3, 1887, chap. 373,  1, 24 Stat. at L. 552, required that the value of the matter in dispute, exclusive of interest and costs, be in excess of $2,000. Upon the discontinuance of the circuit courts this jurisdiction was transferred to the district courts by  24 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1091, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  991], subject to a restriction that thereafter the value of the matter in controversy should exceed $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\n As long ago as Osborn v. Bank of United States, supra, it was settled that a suit by or against a corporation chartered by an act of Congress is one arising under a law of the United States, and this because, as was said in that case, pp. 823, 825: 'The charter of incorporation \n\n[241 U.S. 295, 306]\n\u00a0\n not only creates it [the corporation], but gives it every faculty which it possesses. The power to acquire rights of any description, to transact business of any description, to make contracts of any description, to sue on those contracts, is given and measured by its charter, and that charter is a law of the United States. This being can acquire no right, make no contract, bring no suit, which is not authorized by a law of the United States. It is not only itself the mere creature of a law, but all its actions and all its rights are dependent on the same law. Can a being, thus constituted, have a case which does not arise literally, as well as substantially, under the law? Take the case of a contract, which is put as the strongest against the bank. . . . The act of Congress is its foundation. The contract could never have been made, but under the authority of that act. The act itself is the first ingredient in the case, is its origin, is that from which every other part arises. That other questions may also arise, as the execution of the contract, or its performance, cannot change the case, or give it any other origin than the charter of incorporation. The action still originates in, and is sustained by, that charter.'\n After the act of March 3, 1875, extended the jurisdiction of the circuit courts to cases arising under the laws of the United States, the ruling just quoted was uniformly followed and applied in suits by and against Federal corporations (Pacific R. Removal Cases, \n115 U.S. 1\n, 29 L. ed. 319, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1113; Petri v. Commercial Nat. Bank, \n142 \nU.S. 644, 648\n, 35 S. L. ed. 1144, 1145, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 325; Butler v.

Rep. 299), save where the particular suit was withdrawn or excluded from that jurisdiction by some specific enact- \n\n[241 U.S. 295, 307]\n\u00a0\n ment, like that of July 12, 1882, chap. 290,  4, 22 Stat. at L. 162, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9665, placing most of the suits by and against national banks in the same category with suits by and against banks not organized under the laws of the United States. Leather Mfrs. Nat.

Rep. 54.\n It results that if the general jurisdictional provision, now embodied in  24 of the Judicial Code, respecting suits arising under the laws of the United States, were alone to be considered, it would have to be held that the district court had jurisdiction of the present suit as one falling within that class by reason of the incorporation of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company under a law of the United States. But  5 of the act of January 28, 1915, must also be considered. It is a later enactment, is shown by the title to be amendatory of the Judicial Code, and, as has been seen, declares that 'no court of the United States shall have jurisdiction of any action or suit by or against any railroad company upon the ground that said railroad company was incorporated under an act of Congress.' These are direct and comprehensive words, and, when read in the light of the settled course of decision just mentioned, must be taken as requiring that a suit by or against a railroad company incorporated under an act of Congress be not regarded, for jurisdictional purposes, as arising under the laws of the United States, unless there be some adequate ground for so regarding it other than that the company was thus incorporated. Plainly, there was a purpose to effect a real change in the jurisdiction of such suits. Counsel for plaintiff concede that this is so. But they urge that all that is intended is to eliminate the mere creation of a railroad corporation under an act of Congress as a ground for regarding the suit as arising under the laws of the United States. In this there is an evident misapprehension of what constitutes incorporation, as \n\n[241 U.S. 295, 308]\n\u00a0\n also of the real basis of the jurisdiction affected. A corporation is never merely created. Being artificial, possessing no faculties or powers save such as are conferred by law, and having in legal contemplation no existence apart from them, its incorporation consists in giving it individuality and endowing it with the faculties and powers which it is to possess. It is upon this theory that the decisions have proceeded. The ruling has been that a suit by or against a Federal corporation arises under the laws of the United States, not merely because the corporation owes its creation to an act of Congress, but because it derives all of its capacities, faculties, and powers from the same source. This is shown in the quotation before made from Osborn v. Bank of United States, supra, and also in the following excerpt from Shoshone Min. Co. v. Rutter, \n177 \nU.S. 505, 509\n, 510 S., 44 L. ed. 864, 866, 867, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 726: 'A corporation has no powers and can incur no obligations except as authorized or provided for in its charter. Its power to do any act which it asumes to do, and its liability to any obligation which is sought to be cast upon it, depend upon its charter, and when such charter is given by one of the laws of the United States there is the primary question of the extent and meaning of that law. In other words, as to every act or obligation the first question is whether that act or obligation is within the scope of the law of Congress; and that being the matter which must be first determined, a suit by or against the corporation is one which involves a construction of the terms of its charter; in other words, a question arising under the law of Congress.' And so, when due regard is had for the terms of the amendatory section of 1915 and for the real basis of the jurisdiction affected, the conclusion is unavoidable that what is intended is to make the fact that a railroad company is incorporated under an act of Congress,-that is to say, derives its existence, faculties, and powers from such an act,-an entirely negligible factor in determining whether a suit by or \n\n[241 U.S. 295, 309]\n\u00a0\n against the company is one arising under the laws of the United States.\n Upon examining the bill in the present suit, it is certain that it does not arise under those laws apart from the incorporation of the Texas & Pacific Company under acts of Congress. We say 'acts' of Congress, because the original act was amended and supplemented by three others, and the four constitute the company's charter. Portions thereof are copied into the bill as showing that the mortgage sought to be enforced was given under a power conferred by Congress, but this does not help the jurisdiction. As, under the amendatory section, the fact that the company derives its existence and all of its faculties and powers from a Federal charter cannot avail to give jurisdiction, it is obvious that to dwell upon the fact that any particular power comes from the common source must be equally unavailing.\n The case of Male v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. \n240 U.S. 97\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 351, does not make for a different conclusion, because it was not a suit by or against a railroad company incorporated under an act of Congress, and because it arose and was pending in this court prior to the amendatory act of 1915, and by  6 of that act was excepted from its provisions.\n\n 3. \nWhether this is a suit between citizens of different states turns upon whether the Texas & Pacific company is a citizen of Texas. It is doubtful that the pleader intended to state a case of diverse citizenship, but, be this as it may, we are of opinion that the company is not a citizen of any state. It was incorporated under acts of Congress, not under state laws; and its activities and operations were not to be confined to a single state, but to be carried on, as in fact they are, in different states. Of course it is a citizen of the United States in the sense that a corporation organized under the laws of one of the states is a citizen of that state, but it is not within the \n\n[241 U.S. 295, 310]\n\u00a0\n clause of the 14th Amendment which declares that native born and naturalized citizens of the United States shall be citizens of the state wherein they reside. Nor has Congress said that it shall be regarded as possessing state citizenship for jurisdictional purposes, as is done in respect of national banks by  24, 16, of the Judicial Code. In short, there is no ground upon which the company can be deemed a citizen of Texas, and this being so, the suit is not one between citizens of different states.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Tennessee v.

The defendants (plaintiffs in error here) filed separate answers, the pertinent parts of which may be summarized as follows: They denied the title of the state, the location of the lands as alleged, or their relation to the cities of San Pedro and Wilmington, or that they were not susceptible of reclamation for agricultural purposes, or that they had been withheld from sale by the state.\n For an affirmative defense it was alleged that one Phineas Banning, in February, 1866, made application to the \n\n[240 U.S. 142, 146]\n\u00a0\n state under an act of its legislature for the disposition of state lands to purchase the lands in controversy; that he possessed the qualifications to apply to purchase the lands, and on February 15, 1866, did apply to purchase them under an act of the legislature providing for their sale, approved April 27, 1863, and in conformity to his application and the provisions of  7 of that act caused a survey of the lands to be made and a plat and field notes thereof to be completed by the county surveyor of Los Angeles county, and paid a large sum of money to such surveyor April 2, 1866, for legal fees; that he caused a copy of his application and affidavit to be filed in the office of the surveyor general of the state February 15, 1866; that on said date he subscribed the oath required by  28 of the act of 1863, and complied with  29; that by reason of such proceedings he acquired the title to the lands and a contract was created between him and the state whereby the state agreed to sell him the lands upon the terms provided in the act of 1863. That he complied with all other provisions of the act and of other acts, and that a patent was duly issued to him and the title thereby conveyed to him, and by him conveyed to defendants. That the state by this action is attempting to impair the obligation of the contract between the state and Banning, in violation of article 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States.\n That subsequently other applications were made to purchase other lands in the vicinity of location No. 57, which overlapped and conflicted with that made by Banning; that one of said applicants, to wit, one William McFadden, made a demand upon the surveyor general of the state that, in pursuance of  3413 of the Political Code of the state, the contest between the applicants be referred to the proper court for judicial determination of the question as to which of the applicants was entitled to a patent from the state. That, in accordance with \n\n[240 U.S. 142, 147]\n\u00a0\n the requests, the surveyor general referred the contest to the district court of the seventeenth judicial district of the state in and for the county of Los Angeles, and in pursuance thereof McFadden commenced an action against Banning and certain other parties, and it was therein adjudged that Banning was entitled to purchase and to have a patent issued to him, and that Banning was entitled to the approval of his survey and application as to all of the lands described in his amendatory application of January 2, 1878, except a certain described tract, and was entitled to comply with the further provisions of the law to purchase and receive a patent therefor.\n That Banning, on April 5, 1880, paid the first instalment on the purchase price of the land, and, on April 10, 1880, a certificate of purchase was issued to him whereby it was certified that he had in all respects complied with the law and was entitled to receive a patent; that subsequently, on December 14, 1881, another certificate was issued certifying that full payment had been made to the state and that the decree of the court in the contest proceedings had been fully complied with, and that he was entitled to a patent, and thereafter on December 16, 1881, a patent was duly issued in accordance with the certificate and the decree of the district court, and duly recorded in the office of the recorder of Los Angeles county.\n That the defendants have succeeded to the rights of Banning and have become vested with a fee-simple title to the lands paramount to the claim of the state or of any person; that the state is estopped by the judgment of the district court and the proceedings from claiming any right, title, or interest in them or any of them, and that the patent and proceedings are a bar to the claim of the state or of anyone.\n As a third defense,  312, 315-319 \n\n[240 U.S. 142, 148]\n\u00a0\n of the Code of Procedure of the state were pleaded as a bar to the action.\n The trial court found to be true the allegations of the state as to the character of the lands, their location within the inner harbor of San Pedro, and that, since 1870, they have been within 2 miles of the city of San Pedro and Wilmington, being partly within the limits of those cities.\n The court also found the fact of the application of Banning as alleged, the conflict with McFadden, its reference to the district court for decision, the decision and judgment rendered, and the subsequent proceedings had, the payment of the purchase price of the lands, and the issue of patent to Banning. It further found that the patent was void, that no title vested thereby to any land below ordinary high tide, that the state was not estopped by the judgment or the subsequent proceedings, and that they did not bar the claims of the state, nor constitute an adjudication of the matters in controversy against the state, or debar it from prosecuting this action. The court also decided against the bar of the sections of the Code of Procedure.\n From these findings the court concluded and decreed that the state was the owner of the lands, and that the defendants had not nor had either of them any estate or title in them. A motion for new trial was made and denied, and on appeal the supreme court affirmed the judgment and order denying the new trial.\n There is no dispute about the facts. Banning complied with the act of 1863 and subsequent acts concerning the sale of the lands, and acquired title if they had the efficacy to convey it, or were not suspended in their operation by subsequent legislation and by the Constitution of the state, adopted in 1879.1 The supreme court denied in \n\n[240 U.S. 142, 149]\n\u00a0\n some respects such efficacy, and decided that all of the right of Banning to acquire title to the lands was taken away by the Constitution of 1879, and the legislation to which we shall presently refer.\n We need not encumber the opinion with a detail of the statutes. It is conceded and the supreme court has decided that title could be acquired to the tide lands of the state under the act of 1863, and it is conceded that Banning proceeded regularly under that statute and acquired the title if other statutes or the Constitution of 1879 did not intervene to prevent. It is upon the efficacy of the later statutes and the Constitution that the questions in the case depend.\n The specific contention of plaintiffs in error is that, by the application to purchase the lands under the act of 1863, the expenditure of money in accordance with its provisions for a survey of the lands, the statute of 1868 and the Political Code, and the judgment in the McFadden contest, a contract between Banning and the state was made which the Constitution of 1879 or subsequent statutes could not impair.\n The opposing contention is that no inviolable right of purchase vested in Banning or contract occurred until the payment by him of the purchase price of the lands, and that such payment was after the adoption of the Constitution and legislation withdrawing the lands from sale. In other words, that the lands were withdrawn from sale before any right became consummated. \n\n[240 U.S. 142, 150]\n\u00a0\n Some dates are necessary to be given: Banning's application was made in February, 1866. It was allowed to repose without attention until the contest initiated by McFadden in April, 1878, on account of McFadden's application that overlapped and conflicted with Banning's. Judgment was entered in this contest November 26, 1879. This judgment decided Banning's to be the prior right. He made a first payment on the lands March 5, 1880. The certificate was issued April 10, 1880, and a patent executed December 16, 1881. The Constitution was adopted in 1879, as we have seen. And further, in 1872, the town of Wilmington was incorporated, and the supreme court held that by an act passed April 4, 1870, all lands within 2 miles of \"any town or village\" (Statutes of 1869-70,  877) were excluded from sale. This provision was repeated in the Political Code of 1872,  3488. The act of incorporation of Wilmington was repealed in 1887 (Stats. 1887, 108, 109), but the court said: 'If, in point of law, Wilmington was an incorporated town . . . during the interval between the passage and the repeal of the law, then all proceedings to purchase the lands in question taken in that interval would be invalid with respect to land within the 2- mile limit.' [People ex rel. Webb v. California Fish Co. 166 Cal. 603, 138 Pac. 79.] This being the law, and the lands lying within 2 miles of the limits of Wilmington as incorporated by the act of 1872, the court said: 'The patent is void and all claims of any of the defendants thereunder are invalid.' [166 Cal. 632, 138 Pac. 100.]\n We accept this construction of the act incorporating Wilmington and the effect of the act of April 4, 1870, and of  3488 of the Political Code and the exclusion thereby of tide lands within 2 miles of Wilmington from sale; and we are brought to the short point of the effect of the application and proceedings under it by the payment of the first instalment of the purchase price of the lands and the other acts relied on, whether they consummated \n\n[240 U.S. 142, 151]\n\u00a0\n a contract between the state and Banning, protected by the Constitution of the United States.\n To support such conclusion plaintiffs in error cite McConnaughy v. Pennoyer, 43 Fed. 196, in which Judge Deady expressed the view of an Oregon statute which offered the lands of that state for sale, that such an application was 'a written acceptance of the offer of the state, in relation to the land of the state described therein,' and they cite the same case in this court (\n140 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 35 S. L. ed. 363, 368, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 699), where that view was pronounced forcible and might have been conclusive but for the opposing consideration that suggested itself that the bare application itself, unaccompanied by the payment of any consideration, partook of the nature of a preemption claim under the laws of the United States, with reference to which it had been held that the occupancy and improvement of the land by the settler and the filing of the declaratory statement of such fact conferred no vested right as against the government of the United States until all of the preliminary steps prescribed by law, including the payment of the price, were complied with. Yosemite Valley Case (Hutchings v. Low), 15 Wall. 77, 21 L. ed. 82, and Frisbie v. Whitney, 9 Wall. 187, 19 L. ed. 668, were cited. The court found it unnecessary to determine between those views.\n The cited cases were approved in Campbell v. Wade, \n132 \nU.S. 34, 38\n, 33 S. L. ed. 240, 242, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 9, and their principle applied to statutes of the state of Texas, one offering land for sale and the other withdrawing it before the performance of the conditions which gave a right of purchase. These conditions were an application to the surveyor of the county in which the land was situated to survey the land and within sixty days after survey to file it in the General Land Office. Within sixty days after such filing, it was provided by the statute, it should be the right of the applicant to pay the purchase money, and upon doing so to receive patent for the land. 'But for this declaration of the act,' this \n\n[240 U.S. 142, 152]\n\u00a0\n court said, by Mr. Justice Field, 'we might doubt whether a right to purchase could be considered as conferred by the mere survey so as to bind the state.'\n Considering the same statute in Telfener v. Russ, \n145 \nU.S. 522, 532\n, 36 S. L. ed. 800, 805, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 930, it was said that the right was 'designated in the decision of the supreme court of the state as a vested right that could not be defeated by subsequent legislation.'\n Plaintiffs in error cite Northern P. R. Co. v. DeLacey, \n174 U.S. 622\n, 43 L. ed. 1111, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 791, an in some way modifying the doctrine of the Yosemite Valley Case and of Frisbie v. Whitney. That case involved the question whether a claim of pre-emption had, under the circumstances stated in the case, so far attached to the land in controversy that it did not pass under a grant to the railroad company as land to which the United States had 'full title, not reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, and free from preemption, or other claims or rights.' It was held to have so passed; in other words, that the claim had not attached to the land, DeLacy not having performed the conditions of its pre-emption. The case has no value in the solution of the questions presented by the case at bar. Nor have the other cases cited by plaintiffs in error for the proposition that an offer made by a state, though no particular person be designated, and accepted, constitutes a contract which will be protected by the Federal Constitution. The proposition in its generality may be admitted. Its illustration and application in the cited cases it would protract this opinion unnecessarily to detail. It is enough to say that the cases are not apposite. The offer and acceptance must have the characteristics of a bargain, must be conventional counterparts, as in the cited cases, and of which we may say generally franchises were offered on one part and accepted on the other by the undertaking of works costly to construct and costly to maintain, and from which the public derived great benefit. \n\n[240 U.S. 142, 153]\n\u00a0\n But even in such case it was pointed out in Wisconsin & M. R. Co. v. Powers, \n191 \nU.S. 379, 386\n, 48 S. L. ed. 229, 231, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 107, that the offer of a state does not necessarily imply a contract. It may be of encouragement merely, 'holding out a hope, but not amounting to a covenant.' The offer of the state was an exemption from taxation, and the asserted acceptance of the offer which was said to consummate a contract was the building of a railroad, and it was observed that the 'building and operating of the railroad was a sufficient detriment or change of position to constitute a consideration if the other elements were present. But the other elements are that the promise and the detriment are the conventional inducements each for the other. No matter what the actual motive may have been, by the express or implied terms of the supposed contract, the promise and consideration must purport to be the motive each for the other, in whole or at least in part. It is not enough that the promise induces the detriment or that the detriment induces the promise, if the other half is wanting.' The 'offer' and 'acceptance' we held not to constitute a contract. This comment is applicable to the case at bar, and the supreme court of the state has decided, as we shall presently see, that the filing of the application does not constitute a binding contract upon the part of the applicant and the state.\n But plaintiffs in error say that this court is not bound, against the invocation of the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States, by the decision of the supreme court of the state of California as to the construction and effect of the act of 1863, and subsequent legislation supplementing its provisions. Louisiana R. & Nav. Co. v. Behrman, \n235 U.S. 164\n, 59 L. ed. 175, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 62; New York Electric Lines Co. v. Empire City Subway Co. \n235 U.S. 179\n, 59 L. ed. 184, L.R.A. --, --, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 72, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 906. And they insist that the language of the act explicitly offered the lands for sale, which offer was accepted by Banning through his application, the oath taken by him, and the expenditures \n\n[240 U.S. 142, 154]\n\u00a0\n made by him, and that this construction has supporting strength from the judicial contest authorized by the act, and that the judgment rendered in such contest was effective not only against the losing contestant, but against the state as well.\n If we apply the analogy of the pre-emption laws we shall have to reject immediately the contention based on the proceedings aside from the judgment rendered upon a conflict of applications, and against the asserted effect of such judgment we have also the analogy of a conflict of claims under the mining laws of the United States. In other words, the state made an offer to sell, which might have been perfected into an inviolable right, and provided for a contest of conflicting claims, not as against itself, but as to the rights of the contending parties. The rightful claimant being determined and his right of purchase perfected, the state is then bound by its offer, and is then, and not until then, precluded from legislation withdrawing it. And the right of purchase is perfected only by the payment of some instalment of the purchase price of the land. It is only then that the state has received anything of value from the applicant. What he has done prior, the expenditures he has made, are but the qualifications to become a purchaser, not binding him to proceed, nor binding the state to wait for that which may never be done before it determines on other uses or disposition of the lands. And to wait might mean serious embarrassment. We have seen in the case at bar that Banning applied first in 1866. His application was permitted to repose in the files of the county or state officers until 1878, when activity upon it was provoked by another application.\n Plaintiffs in error have been unable to cite a single decision in sanction of their contention. The supreme court refers to one (Hinckley v. Fowler, 43 Cal. 63), decided in 1872, as possibly being urged to support it. \n\n[240 U.S. 142, 155]\n\u00a0\n If we may venture to express our understanding of that case, we should say that it is seriously disputable if it so decides. However, the court said that the case, so far as it announced such view, that is, 'so far as it announces the rule that the filing of the application creates a contract binding on the state before any part of the price is paid, must be considered as overruled by the later decisions.' Messenger v. Kingsbury, 158 Cal. 615, 112 Pac. 65, and cases cited. Also Polk v. Sleeper, 158 Cal. 632, 112 Pac. 179. And these cases have become rules of property and factors in decision,-indeed, would determine it, even if we had doubt of the construction of the applicable statutes, under the ruling of Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 U.S. 20\n, 27 L. ed. 359, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10, and many subsequent cases.\n A somewhat confused contention is made that by the act of March 28, 1868, and under the Political Code the rights of plaintiffs in error were preserved, and yet it seems to be contended that, though both act and Code contain a provision excluding from their operation tide lands within 2 miles of any town or village, such provision is not applicable to lands theretofore applied for. The contentions we may suppose were rejected by the supreme court. And plaintiffs in error say that a decision either way cannot affect their 'prior contention, that a binding contract of sale was created by the acceptance of the state's offer, through the filing in 1866 of an application to purchase under the act of 1863.' Further discussion of the contentions is therefore unnecessary. Nor is further discussion of the effect of the judgment in the contest proceedings necessary. If, by the incorporation of Wilmington in 1872, the act of April, 1870, and the Political Code of 1872, which excluded all tide lands within 2 miles of Wilmington, became effective, the lands were withdrawn from sale, and plaintiffs in error could have acquired no rights by proceedings subsequent to such incorporation. This, we have seen, was the judgment of \n\n[240 U.S. 142, 156]\n\u00a0\n the supreme court of the state. The court had decided in prior cases that the state was not a party to the contest (Cunningham v. Crowley, 51 Cal. 128, 133); that the contest decided only the rights of the opposing parties (Berry v. Cammet, 44 Cal. 347; Polk v. Sleeper, supra).\n The judgment undoubtedly is conclusive between the parties, determines their rights, as between themselves, and establishes the privilege to purchase the lands acquired by the prior application, even against the state, 'so long as the statute remained in force,' to use the language of Hinckley v. Fowler, supra. This explanation may be given of all the cases cited by plaintiffs in error upon the effect of the judgment. 1 As long as the statute existed, rights could be acquired under it. Upon its repeal or limitation, such opportunity was taken away.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'No individual, partnership or corporation, claiming or possessing the frontage or tidal lands of a harbor, bay, inlet, estuary, or other navigable water in this state, shall be permitted to exclude the right of way to such water whenever it is required for any public purpose, nor to destroy or obstruct the free navigation of such water; and the legislature shall enact such laws as will give the most liberal construction to this provision, so that access to the navigable waters of this state shall be always attainable for the people thereof.'

Ellsworth and John Knauf for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Charles Donnelly, Charles W. Bunn, and Emerson Hadley for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n In Jamestown & N. R. Co. v. Jones, \n177 U.S. 125\n, 44 L. ed. 698, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 568, there came under consideration the construction of the act of Congress of March 3, 1875, entitled, 'An Act Granting to Railroads the Right of Way through the Public Lands \n\n[240 U.S. 484, 485]\n\u00a0\n of the United States,' chap. 152, 18 Stat. at L. 482, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4921. The case involved a controversy between the railroad which was entitled to the benefit of the act and Jones, a homestead entryman holding a patent of the United States in consequence of rights initiated after the railroad had constructed its line, but before it had filed a map of its right of way in the appropriate local land office. The railroad claimed that its right of way across the land covered by Jones's patent was paramount, and Jones asserted that his right under the patent was dominant. Giving sanction to a previous course of administrative construction dealing with unsurveyed public land, it was held that an appropriation of the right of way by a construction of the road under the statute gave the railroad the paramount right, and that the provision of the statute concerning the filing of a map and profile in the local land office was intended not to deprive of the power to fix and secure the right of way by construction in advance of filing such map and profile, but simply to afford the means of securing the right of way in advance of construction. The two methods of securing the right, the one by construction of the road, and the other in anticipation of construction by filing a map, were decided to in no wise conflict the one with the other, as both afforded a means of securing the right which statute gave. The opinion pointed out that although the previous administrative rulings were concerned only with unsurveyed lands, they were equally applicable under the statute to surveyed lands, and it was thus concluded: 'It follows from these views that the grant to plaintiff in error (the railroad company) by the act of 1875 became definitely fixed by the actual construction of its road, and that the entry of the defendant in error (Jones) was subject thereto.'\n In Minneapolis, St. P. & S. Ste. M. R. Co. v. Doughty, \n208 U.S. 251\n, 52 L. ed. 474, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 291, the controversy was between the railway company and a settler holding a patent of the United \n\n[240 U.S. 484, 486]\n\u00a0\n States whose right had been initiated before the construction of the railroad, but after a preliminary survey which had been made by the railroad as a means of ultimately determining upon what line it would build its road, the stakes of such survey being, at the time the settler initiated his right, across the land in question. The claim of the settler was that a mere entry of the railroad for the purpose stated was not a construction within the meaning of the Jones Case, while that of the railroad was 'that an entry upon the land to locate the road is as necessary as an entry on the land to build the road, and, being there, the railroad 'could not become a trespasser, either as to the government or as to the plaintiff.\" It was decided that as a mere preliminary step for the purpose of determining where the road should be located was not, in and of itself, the equivalent of a definite location of the line and a permanent appropriation of the right of way, the case was not covered by the rule of the Jones Case and the right of the settler was paramount.\n Which of these rulings is here controlling is the single question arising for decision on this record, as will be at once seen by the following statement of the case:\n The suit was commenced by the railroad to quiet its title to its right of way across a quarter section of land which had been patented by the United States to the defendant. The latter not only by answer, but by counterclaim, asserted the paramount nature of his right. The court below, affirming the action of the trial court, held that the rights of the railroad were paramount upon the conclusion that the facts found clearly brought the case within the rule established in the Jones Case. 26 N. D. 159, 143 N. W. 903. The facts as thus established were these:\n\"On the said 22d day of July, A. D. 1883, intending to make entry of the said land herein described when the same was surveyed, and to acquire title to the same by \n\n[240 U.S. 484, 487]\n\u00a0\n virtue of compliance with the pre-emption laws of the United States, said Frederick G. Barlow [the predecessor in title of the plaintiff in error] settled upon said land and took up his residence thereon. At the time of such settlement there was not a railroad track or line of railroad in operation across said land at any place, nor had plat or profile of the section of railroad extending across said land hereinbefore referred to been filed in the United States district land office at Fargo.' We find from the evidence that although Varlow entered upon the land upon the 22d day of July A. D. 1883, the grading of the road across said land was completed prior to May 31, 1883; that is to say, nearly two months before his settlement. We also find the rails were laid upon the grade between August 10 and 15, 1883, and that trains were operated on said road and across said land soon after.'\n\n That under these facts the court below was right in holding that the controversy was foreclosed by the ruling in the Jones Case we think is too clear for anything but statement. The contention that the case is controlled by the Doughty, and not the Jones Case, because the road was not complete and operating when the entryman initiated his rights, although it was then graded and was virtually ready for the ties and rails, if acceded to, would render the statute inefficacious, and dominate the substance of things by the mere shadow. The first, because as it is impossible to conceive of the completion of the road by the placing of ties and the laying of rails without presupposing the prior doing of the work of grading, it would follow that the recognition of the right of an entryman to appropriate adversely to the railroad after the grading had been done, and before the laying of the ties and rails, would render the performance of the latter useless, and would deprive the railroad, therefore, of all practical power to appropriate. The second, because, as pointed out in Stalker v. Oregon \n\n[240 U.S. 484, 488]\n\u00a0\n Short Line R. Co. \n225 U.S. 142\n, 56 L. ed. 1027, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 636, the decision in the Jones Case rested not upon the ground that the work of construction had reached the absolutely completed stage so as to enable the road to be operated, but on the fact that the work was of such a character as to manifest that the railroad company had exercised its judgment as to where its line was to be established, and had done such work of construction as 'necessarily fixes the position of the route and consummates the purpose for which the grant of a right of way is given.' ( p. 150.) And it is obvious that this standard, when complied with, would serve not only to demonstrate the fixed intention of the railroad to appropriate, but also to give tangible and indubitable evidence to others of the right of way appropriated, thus preventing injury to innocent persons which might result from their selection of land in ignorance of the fact of its prior appropriation. The sistinction between the doctrine of the Jones Case and that of the Doughty Case is therefore that which necessarily must obtain between permanent work of construction of a railroad on a line definitely selected and fixed by it, and mere tentative work of surveying, done by a railroad for the purpose of enabling the line which it was proposed to construct to be ultimately selected. The broad distinction between this case and the Doughty Case, both as to the fundamental rights given by the statute and the protection to innocent parties, was thus lucidly pointed out by the court below in its opinion:\n'There can be no doubt, indeed, that the route was fixed, both on account of the physical construction and the difficulty of a subsequent removal, . . . The entryman in the case of Stalker v. Oregon Short Line for complaint than could the entryman in the case of Stalker v. Oregon Short Line R. Co. supra. It would be absurd to hold that one who enters upon land and sees upon it a railroad grade which is only eighteen days from physical completion, and, as we have a right to believe, but a link in miles of \n\n[240 U.S. 484, 489]\n\u00a0\n foad stretching across the same prairie, was not aware of this prior railroad occupation.'\n\n We have not stopped to consider an intimation contained in the argument that the court erred in its finding of fact as to the state of construction of the road at the time the entry by Barlow was made, because without at all questioning our power to review the facts in so far as necessary to dispose of the Federal contention, we consider the suggestion wholly without merit, first, because we would not in any event disregard the finding of fact of the court below except upon conviction of clear error committed, for which the record here affords no ground whatever; and second, because as the finding of the court below was also the finding of the trial court, the request invites us to disregard the findings of both courts on a matter of fact in the absence of any ground for a conviction that error of fact was clearly committed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBASSO v. U S(1916)\nNo. 142\nArgued: January 6, 1916Decided: January 17, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 602, 603]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry M. Ward for appellant.\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 602, 604]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Appellant is a Spanish subject who resided, at the time his alleged cause of action accrued and at the time his petition was filed in the court of claims, in the island of Porto Rico.\n Porto Rico was ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris, ratifications of which were exchanged April 11, 1899 [30 Stat. at L. 1754]. The island was occupied by the military forces of the United States prior to January 1, 1899, and February 1, 1899, the President of the United States, by order, promulgated the 'Amended Customs Tariff and Regulations for Ports in Porto Rico,' which fixed and provided for the collection of duties upon all articles imported into \n\n[239 U.S. 602, 605]\n\u00a0\n Porto Rico. And duties were collected thereafter in accordance with such tariff and the amendments thereto made from time to time until May 1, 1900\n\n\n Certain officers of the Army were designated to act and did act as collectors of customs under such tariff at the several ports of entry in Porto Rico, and enforced such tariff upon merchandise brought into Porto Rico from the United States and from foreign countries.\n Under authority of general order No. 88 the general commanding in the island established a provisional court of the United States for the department of Porto Rico.\n On or about July 13, 1899, by information filed by the prosecuting officer of the provisional court, appellant was charged before that court with the crime of having imported from the United States into Porto Rico certain merchandise without having made entry of the same in the customhouse, and without having paid duty thereon. He was arraigned, pleaded not guilty, and the case was set for trial.\n At the trial he entered a plea that  2865 and 3082 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Comp. Stat. 1913,  5548, 5785) were without force or effect in Porto Rico, that the latter was part of the United States, and that there was no warrant in law for imposing duties on goods brought from the United States into the island.\n The defenses were not allowed, he was found guilty, sentenced to imprisonment, and was imprisoned for twenty-seven days.\n He alleged the foregoing facts in his petition, and that he suffered damages thereby in the sum of $10,000, $7,500 general and $2,500 special damages. That he is advised by counsel that the act for which he was accused and condemned did not then constitute a crime; that the said sections of the Revised Statutes of the United States under which the provisional court claimed authority to act were not in force in Porto Rico, and the court was \n\n[239 U.S. 602, 606]\n\u00a0\n wholly without jurisdiction in the premises, and its sentence was null and void, and that, by reason of such accusation, trial, conviction, sentence, and imprisonment, he was deprived of his liberty without due process of law in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n Judgment was prayed for the sum of $10,000.\n The United States filed a general traverse of the petition, but subsequently moved to dismiss upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to consider it, it presenting 'an action for damages in a case sounding in tort.'\n The motion was sustained and judgment entered dismissing the petition for want of jurisdiction. This appeal was then taken.\n Appellant concedes that 'the cause of action not merely 'sounds in tort,' but is based wholly upon the tortious actions of the agents of the United States.' He, however, contends that the court of claims has jurisdiction under the Tucker act over claims ex delicto founded upon the Constitution of the United States. And this, he further contends, is supported by the recent decisions of this court, and relies especially upon Dooley v. United States, \n182 U.S. 222\n, 45 L. ed. 1074, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 762.\n But that case did not overrule Schillinger v. United States, \n155 U.S. 163\n, 39 L. ed. 108, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 85, which, counsel says, holds directly contrary to his contention, and that he has not the ingenuity to suggest how the court can now decide the case at bar in appellant's favor without at least by implication overruling the Schillinger Case. We are not disposed to overrule the case, either directly or by implication. The court found nothing in it antagonistic to the reasoning and conclusion reached in the Dooley Case.\n In United States v. Lynah, \n188 U.S. 445\n, 47 L. ed. 539, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 349, the Schillinger Case was treated as subsisting authority, and Mr. Justice Brown, who wrote the opinion in the Dooley Case, in his concurring opinion in the Lynah Case, considered it as correctly declaring the law. \n\n[239 U.S. 602, 607]\n\u00a0\n The Dooley Case and cases subsequent to it which are relied upon by appellant concerned the exaction of duties or taxes by the United States or its officers, or property taken by the government for public purposes. \n1\n In such cases jurisdiction in the court of claims for the recovery of the duties and taxes or for the value of the property taken was declared.\n In the case at bar (assuming as true all that is charged) there was a wrong inflicted, if a wrong can be said to have been inflicted by the sentence of a court legally constituted, after judgment upon issues openly framed by the opposing parties, both of fact and the applicable law, whether that law was  2865 and 3082 of the Revised Statutes or the Constitution of the United States (Comp. Stat. 1913,  5548, 5785). But, conceding that a wrong was inflicted through these judicial forms, the case nevertheless is of different character from the Dooley Case, as was also the Schillinger Case. The latter case passed upon the jurisdiction of the court of claims in actions founded on tort, and declared the general principle to be, based on a policy imposed by necessity, that governments are not liable 'for unauthorized wrongs inflicted on the citizen by their officers, though occurring while engaged in the discharge of official duties.' And it was further said: 'Congress has wisely reserved to itself the right to give or withhold relief where the claim is founded on wrongful proceedings of an officer of the government.' Gibbons v. United States, 8 Wall. 269, 275, 19 L. ed. 453, 454; Morgan v. United States, 14 Wall. 531, 534, 20 L. ed. 738, 739.\n The Schillinger Case was cited in the New Orleans-Belize Royal Mail & C. A. S. S. Co. v. United States, \n239 U.S. 202\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 76, in rejection of a contention that the United States was liable for services imposed by their officers outside of a contract \n\n[239 U.S. 602, 608]\n\u00a0\n with the Royal Mail Company, in the performance of which the vessel owned by the company was damaged.\n We repeat, therefore, that the Schillinger Case being subsisting authority, and appellant conceding that, if such be its value, it is controlling, further discussion is unnecessary.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

Gowen for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action for damages under the Federal employers' liability act [35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657, 36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143], brought in the circuit court of Norfolk county, state of Virginia, by plaintiff in error (we shall call him plaintiff), administrator of the estate of Richard T. Baugham.\n The ground of action was that the railroad company, an interstate carrier, caused by its negligence the death of plaintiff's intestate while he was employed and engaged in such commerce.\n Richard T. Baugham was between the ages of eighteen and twenty years, and was engaged by the railroad company to act as brakeman in its yard at Port Norfolk, Virginia. On the second day of his employment, while mounting a freight car that was being transferred from the wharf of the company to a barge moored at the wharf, \n\n[241 U.S. 237, 239]\n\u00a0\n he was killed by being crushed between that car and other cars which were upon the barge.\n There were four tracks on the barge. Between the outside and center tracks, of which there were two, there was sufficient space for an employee to mount in safety cars moving between those tracks. There was also sufficient space between the center tracks for some distance from where they entered the barge from the wharf. But these tracks gradually converged until the space between them so diminished that cars being moved on one center track would almost touch those standing on the other center track. The roofs of the cars would sometimes touch.\n By reason of this proximity of the cars it is alleged that serious and deadly injury would be inflicted upon the servants and employees of the company if they should be caught between the cars. Plaintiff's intestate was so caught and received injuries from which he died.\n It was the duty of the company, it was alleged, to have admonished and warned the deceased of the difficulties, dangers, and perils attendant upon his service and duties as brakeman, so that he might safely have performed them; but that the company wholly failed to do so, and that in consequence the deceased, in the performance of his duties as brakeman on trains being transferred from the wharf to the barge, and while ascending on of the cars, was caught and confined between the eaves of the roof of the car which he was ascending and the eaves of the roof or roofs on another car or cars and fatally injured.\n Damages were prayed in the sum of $50,000.\n The company pleaded not guilty, and, as special defenses, that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence, and that he 'assumed, when he entered the employment of the company, the risk of being injured in the manner charged in the declaration.'\n The case was tried to a jury. Upon the conclusion of \n\n[241 U.S. 237, 240]\n\u00a0\n the testimony the company demurred to the evidence, and plaintiff joined in the demurrer; whereupon, the jury being required to say what damages the plaintiff sustained if judgment should be given for plaintiff upon the evidence, responded, 'that if, upon the demurrer to the evidence, the law be for the plaintiff, then we find for the plaintiff, and assess the damages which he ought to recover at $10,000.'\n The demurrer to the evidence was sustained, and it was adjudged that plaintiff take nothing by his suit. The judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of appeals.\n The tracks on the barge and the operation of the cars can easily be visualized. there were four tracks, two center ones and two outside ones, the former converging as they approached until they came so close together that any one caught between cars moving upon them would be crushed. The deceased, while ascending a moving car, was caught between it and a car standing on the barge and fatally injured. The inquiry is-and upon it resta the determination of the case-What knowledge had the deceased of this situation, and what was the effect of that knowledge upon the liability, if any, of the company?\n Plaintiff makes two contentions: (1) That the company failed to warn deceased of the danger to which he was exposed, and that such failure was negligence on the part of the company. (2) That the convergence of the tracks on the barge was a defect or insufficiency due to the negligence of the company in its track, roadbed, barge, and equipment.\n The railroad company opposes plaintiff's contentions and insists that the deceased assumed the risk of the danger which resulted in his injury and death. A detemination of these contentions depends upon the evidence, and, considering it, the state courts, trial and appellate, decided against the contentions of plaintiff, and in so doing in effect held that the conditions of the assumption \n\n[241 U.S. 237, 241]\n\u00a0\n of risk by deceased were satisfied.

BRADLEY(1916)\nNo. 592\nArgued: Decided: June 5, 1916\n\n\n\n Mr. William Dillon for appellant. \n\n[241 U.S. 511, 512]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Benjamin S. Minor, Almon W. Bulkley, Clair E. More, Hugh B. Rowland, and Colley W. Bell for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a final order of the district court, denying an application for a writ of habeas corpus in an extradition case. The facts are to be gathered from the petition for the writ and the exhibits therein referred to and made a part of it, which include a sworn complaint by the British Consul General at Chicago, applying on behalf of the government of the Dominion of Canada for the extradition of appellant to Montreal, certain ex parte affidavits taken in Montreal, and a complaint made and warrant issued against appellant in that city, and abstract of the oral testimony taken before the United States Commissioner at Chicago, and the warrant of commitment issued by the Commissioner, under which appellant is held in custody.\n The complaint of the Consul General sets forth on information and belief that appellant, in the month of February, 1915, was guilty of the crime of receiving and retaining in his possession money to the amount of $ 1,500 in bills of the Bank of Montreal, the property of that bank, knowing the same to have been stolen; that a warrant has been issued by the police magistrate of the city of Montreal for the apprehension of appellant for the crime memtioned; that appellant is guilty of the indictable offense of receiving money knowing it to have been stolen, and is a fugitive from justice from the district of Montreal, province of Quebec, and Dominion of Canada, and is now within the territory of the United States; that the offense of which he is charged is an offense within the treaties between the United States and Great Britain; and that deponent's information is based upon duly au- \n\n[241 U.S. 511, 513]\n\u00a0\n thenticated copies of a warrant issued by the police magistrate of Montreal and of the complaint or information upon which that warrant was issued, and upon certain depositions of witnesses submitted to be filed with the present complaint. The reference is to the Montreal affidavits, which set forth in substance that in the month of September, 1911,a branch of the Bank of Montreal at New Westminister, British Columbia, was broken into and a large sum of money ($271,721) stolen from the bank, including a considerable number of $5 bills of the Bank of Montreal, seventy-eight of these being identified by their numbers; that on February 10, 1915, in the city of Montreal, appellant purchased a diamond ring from one Eaves, a jeweler, and paid for it $250, of which $245 was composed of new Bank of Montreal $5 bills, more than thirty of these being identified by the numbers as among those stolen; that on February 9, 1915, one Wakefield purchased in Montreal some travelers' checks, paying for them in part with fifty new $5 bills of the Bank of Montreal, of which twenty or more were identified as being a part of the stolen money; and that on February 10, 1915, Wakefield procured from a firm of bankers in Montreal an exchange of Canadian bills for American currency, the exchange including fifty new $5 bills of the Bank of Montreal, of which fifteen or more were identified as being a part of those stolen.\n Appellant having been apprehended, a hearing was had before the United States Commissioner, at which the above-mentioned documents were introduced and testimony was given tending to show that appellant and Wakefield were together in Montreal on the 9th and 10th of February, 1915, cooperating in the exchange of the stolen bills for travelers' checks and United States currency; and that on the evening of February 10th they left Montreal together in a manner indicating an intent to evade detection, and went to Chicago, where almost \n\n[241 U.S. 511, 514]\n\u00a0\n immediately they began systematic efforts to procure the exchange of Bank of Montreal bills for United States currency.\n The Commissioner deeming the evidence sufficient to sustain the charge, the warrant of commitment was issued, the proceedings and evidence being certified in due course to the Secretary of State, pursuant to  5270, Rev. Stat. (Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,110).\n Under the applicable provisions of our treaties with Great Britain ( treaty of 1842, art. 10, 8 Stat. at L. 572, 576; treaty of 1889, art 1, 26 Stat. at L. 1508, 1509), there is included among the extraditable offenses that of 'receiving any money, valuable security, or other property, knowing the same to have been embezzled, stolen, or fraudulently obtained.'\n In behalf of appellant it is objected that while the Criminal Code of Canada defines as indictable offenses (a) the receiving or retaining in possession anything obtained by any offense punishable on indictment knowing it to have been so obtained, and (b) the receiving or retaining in possession any money or valuable security or other thing, the stealing whereof is declared to be an indictable offense, knowing the same to have been stolen, the offense charged in the complaint filed and in the warrant issued in Montreal and in the Consul General's complaint is that of receiving and retaining in his possession money, etc., knowing it had been stolen. The argument is that the Canadian statute treats receiving and retaining as distinct offenses, connecting them with the disjunctive 'or,' while the complaints treat the two acts as together constituting one offense. Properly interpreted, however, they charge the commission of both offenses; and if only one, that of receiving, etc., is extraditable by the treaty, this does not render appellant's detention unlawful, since it is not to be presumed that the demanding government will suffer him to be tried or punished for any offense other than that for which he is surrendered, in violation \n\n[241 U.S. 511, 515]\n\u00a0\n of article 3 of the treaty of 1889. Kelly v. Griffin, \n241 \nU.S. 6, 15\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 487.\n It is insisted that the Consul General's complaint does not allege that the offense was committed in Canada, that the evidence relied upon raises no presumption that appellant committed anywhere the offense of receiving stolen property knowing it to be stolen (the offense specified in the treaty), and that it raises no presumption that appellant committed the offense in Montreal or anywhere in the Dominion of Canada.\n The criticism upon the complaint is unsubstantial. It is fairly to be inferred from what is stated that the crime was committed in Canada, and it is distinctly averred that appellant is a fugitive from justice from the district of Montreal, in that Dominion, and that the offense with which he is charged is an offense within the treaties between the United States and Great Britain. Besides this, it is stated that deponent's information is based upon authenticated copies of a warrant issued by the police magistrate of Montreal, and of the complaint upon which that warrant was issued, and upon certain depositions submitted and to be filed with the present complaint; the depositions being those taken in Montreal. It is clear that the intent was to charge that the offense was committed in Canada.\n As to the effect of the evidence: The Commissioner doubtless held that the fact of possession, taken in connection with the other facts of the case, raised a presumption either that appellant was a party to the burglary or that he afterwards obtained possession of the bills with guilty knowledge. Appellant disputes the inference, and, assuming it to be well founded, insists that there is nothing in the law of probabilities to sustain an inference that 'possession by a man during a visit of a few days to Montreal of goods that were stolen more than three years previously in British Columbia makes it more probable \n\n[241 U.S. 511, 516]\n\u00a0\n that he received the goods in Canada than that he received them in the United States.' There is nothing in the evidence to require the inference that appellant was paying a brief visit to Montreal. It appears that he has a brother who is in business in Chicago, and that he himself was in that city in the summer of 1914, and, on three occasions, with intervals of several weeks, exchanged Canadian money there for United States currency. This is consistent with the inference that he was then exchanging part of the stolen money, but does not require the inference that he had a fixed place of abode in Chicago. The stolen bills that were in appellant's possession in Montreal in February, 1915, are not shown to have been removed from the Dominion after the time they were stolen from the bank in September, 1911. As it was a reasonable inference-they being 'new bills'-that they had never before been used in exchange, and because so many of them were found together in the hands of appellant and his confederate three and a half years after the burglary, it was further inferable that they had been retained during the intervening period with the purpose of awaiting such opportunity for passing them as might come from relaxed vigilance on the part of the authorities; and since the Dominion of Canada is the natural and convenient market for bills of the Bank of Montreal, it was inferable that the bills had not been taken out of the Dominion since the time they were stolen; and, if not, it followed that appellant must have been within the Dominion when he received them. That they were received with knowledge that they had been stolen, might be inferred from the fact of the burglary, coupled with the suspicious circumstances (only a part of which we have referred to) attending the efforts to exchange them for other forms of property.\n The Commissioner deemed the evidence sufficient to sustain the charge ( Rev. Stat.  5270, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,110), and since he had jurisdiction of the subjectmatter and of the accused, and \n\n[241 U.S. 511, 517]\n\u00a0\n the offense is within the treaty, his finding cannot be reversed on habeas corpus if he acted upon competent and adequate evidence. McNamara v. Henkel, \n226 \nU.S. 520, 523\n, 57 S. L. ed. 330, 332, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 146.\n It is insisted that the Montreal affidavits, essential to show that the alleged offense was committed within the Dominion, were incompetent because taken ex parte, in the absence of appellant, and without opportunity for cross-examination. The treaty of 1842 provides in article 10 that extradition shall only be had 'upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or offense had there been committed.' Sec. 5271, Rev. Stat. (Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,111), as amended by act of August 3, 1882,  5 and 6 (chap. 378, 22 Stat. at L. 216, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,116), provides that any depositions, warrants, or other papers or copies thereof shall be admissible in evidence at the hearing if properly authenticated so as to entitle them to be received for similar purposes by the tribunals of the foreign country, and that the certificate of the principal diplomatic or consular officer of the United States resident in the foreign country shall be proof of such authentication. The Montreal affidavits, complaints, warrant, etc., are properly authenticated in accordance with this provision. It is one of the objects of  5271 to obviate the necessity of confronting the accused with the witnesses against him; and a construction of this section, or of the treaty, that would require the demanding government to send its citizens to another country to institute legal proceedings, would defeat the whole object of the treaty. Rice v. Ames, \n180 \nU.S. 371, 375\n, 45 S. L. ed. 577, 581, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 406, 12 Am. Crim. Rep. 356; Yordi v. Nolte, \n215 \nU.S. 227, 231\n, 54 S. L. ed. 170, 172, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90.\n All of the objections savor of technicality. And since the jurisdiction of the Commissioner is clear, and the evidence abundantly sufficient to furnish reasonable ground for the belief that appellant has committed within \n\n[241 U.S. 511, 518]\n\u00a0\n the Dominion of Canada a crime that is an offense under the laws of the Dominion, as well as under those of Illinois (Jones & A. Anno. Stat. [Ill .]  3892), and is covered by the terms of the treaty, and that he is a fugitive from justice, a fair observance of the obligations of the treaty requires that he be surrendered. Glucksman v. Henkel, \n221 \nU.S. 508, 512\n, 55 S. L. ed. 830, 833, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 704.\n Final order affirmed. \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRAZEE v.

But it did not specifically rule concerning the validity of limitations upon charges for services specified by  5.\n Considering our former opinions it seems clear that without violating the Federal Constitution a state, exercising its police power, may require licenses for employment agencies, and prescribe reasonable regulations in respect of them, to be enforced according to the legal discretion of a commissioner. The general nature of the business is such that, unless regulated, many persons may be exposed to misfortunes against which the legislature can properly protect them. Williams v.

PACIFIC COAST COAL CO.(1916)\nNo. 303\nArgued: March 14, 1916Decided: June 12, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. H. R. Lea, Charles F. Consaul, and Charles C. Heltman for petitioner.\n Messrs. C. H. Farrell, W. B. Stratton,\n J. H. Kane, and Stanley J. Padden for respondent. \n\n[241 U.S. 571, 572]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action for personal injuries caused to the petitioner, the plaintiff, a miner, by an explosion of gas in a coal mine, in consequence, it is alleged, of the defendant's neglect of its duty so to ventilate the mine as to make an explosion impossible. The trial judge left to the jury questions of the plaintiff's contributory negligence or assumption of risk, but instructed them that the law required the defendant to provide a sufficient amount of ventilation; that the duty of the inspection, prevention, and removal of any accumulation of gas was a personal duty of the defendant that could not be delegated; and that an employee, one of whose duties was to test for gas, was not a fellow servant of the miners so far as he was engaged in the performance of that duty. There was a verdict for the plaintiff, which was set aside by the circuit court of appeals. 128 C. C. A. 247, 211 Fed. 869; 130 C. C. A. 625, 214 Fed. 255.\n The duty of the fire boss who exploded the gas was to test for gas as well as to fire the shots in blasting, which last he was about to do. It is unnecessary to go into further details, as the only matter that requires discussion is whether the circuit court of appeals was right in reversing the judgment on the ground that this man was a fellow servant of the plaintiff, and that the defendant's duty to secure ventilation was not absolute. The statute of 1897, which was in force at the time of the accident, September 7, 1910, enacts that the owner or operator of every coal mine 'shall provide in every coal mine a good and sufficient amount of ventilation for such persons and animals as may be employed therein,' fixing a minimum amount, 'and said air must be made to circulate through the shafts, levels, stables, and working places of each mine and on the traveling roads to and from all \n\n[241 U.S. 571, 573]\n\u00a0\n such working places.' Then the division of mines into districts or splits, and the number of men to be employed in each, are provided for, and then the act goes on: 'Each district or split shall be ventilated by a separate and distinct current of air, conducted from the down-cast through said district, and thence directed to the up-cast. . . . In all mines where fire damp is generated, every working place shall be examined every morning with a safety lamp by a competent person, and a record of such examination shall be entered by the person making the same in a book,' etc. Laws of 1897, chap. 45,  4; Bal. Whsh. Code,  3165; Rem. & Bal. Code,  7381\n\n\n In the case of a similar accident occurring under the same law, the supreme court said: 'The duty of inspection, prevention, and removal of any accumulation of gas is imposed on the coal company. This duty is personal, and cannot be delegated. . . . The gas tester, under the facts in this case, was not a fellow servant with the plaintiff. He was the representative of principal duties of the defendant.' The refusal of the instruction that the gas tester was a fellow servant with the plaintiff, a miner, was upheld. Costa v. Pacific Coast Co. 26 Wash. 138, 142, 143, 66 Pac. 398. The language of this case was quoted and the same principle applied in Czarecki v. Seattle & S. F. R. & Nav. Co. 30 Wash. 288, 294, 295, 70 Pac. 750. And the same words were repeated by the judge to the jury in the present case.\n When this case came before the circuit court of appeals, it seems to have been thought that Costa v. Pacific Coast Co. arose under an earlier statute. Upon a petition for rehearing, the court merely stated that no decision of the supreme court had been found that held the person required to examine the working places every morning to be the representative of the master, and that the fire boss must be regarded as a fellow servant with the plaintiff. We are unable to reconcile this view with the \n\n[241 U.S. 571, 574]\n\u00a0\n language that we have quoted. It now is suggested that there is a distinction between the point decided there and here, the failure there having been to warn the miner, and that the remarks of the court were obiter dicta. We shall go into no nice inquiry upon this point. The statements were statements of the principle of the decision, and it was the duty of the circuit court of appeals to follow them. Still less does it matter in a case like this, if, as is said, the latter court had decided otherwise at an earlier time.\n Concerning the facts to which the ruling here dealt with applied, it is enough to say that the evidence warranted a finding by the jury that the defendant had neglected the duties absolutely imposed upon it, without now going into the details of the different views that might have been taken. The other matters that have been argued here, as to the plaintiff's contributory negligence, etc., need not be mentioned further than to say that we see no ground in them for a different result from that which we have reached.\n Judgment reversed.\n Judgment of District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRUSHABER v. UNION PACIFIC R. CO.(1916)\nNo. 140\nArgued: Decided: January 24, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Julien T. Davies, Brainard Tolles, Garrard Glenn, and Martin A.

Because of constitutional questions duly arising the case is here on direct appeal from a decree sustaining a motion to dismiss because no ground for relief was stated.\n The right to prevent the corporation from returning and paying the tax was based upon many averments as to the repugnancy of the statute to the Constitution of the United States, of the peculiar relation of the corporation to the stockholders, and their particular interests resulting from many of the administrative provisions of the assailed act, of the confusion, wrong, and multiplicity \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n of suits and the absence of all means of redress which would result if the corporation paid the tax and complied with the act in other respects without protest, as it was alleged it was its intention to do. To put out of the way a question of jurisdiction we at once say that in view of these averments and the ruling in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. \n157 U.S. 429\n, 39 L. ed. 759, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673, sustaining the right of a stockholder to sue to restrain a corporation under proper averments from voluntarily paying a tax charged to be unconstitutional on the ground that to permit such a suit did not violate the prohibitions of  3224, Revised Statutes (Comp. Stat. 1913,  5947), against enjoining the enforcement of taxes, we are of opinion that the contention here made that there was no jurisdiction of the cause, since to entertain it would violate the provisions of the Revised Statutes referred to, is without merit. Before coming to dispose of the case on the merits, however, we observe that the defendant corporation having called the attention of the government to the pendency of the cause and the nature of the controversy and its unwillingness to voluntarily refuse to comply with the act assailed, the United States, as amicus curiae, has at bar been heard both orally and by brief for the purpose of sustaining the decree.\n Aside from averments as to citizenship and residence, recitals as to the provisions of the statute, and statements as to the business of the corporation, contained in the first ten paragraphs of the bill, advanced to sustain jurisdiction, the bill alleged twenty-one constitutional objections specified in that number of paragraphs or subdivisions. As all the grounds assert a violation of the Constitution, it follows that, in a wide sense, they all charge a repugnancy of the statute to the 16th Amendment, under the more immediate sanction of which the statute was adopted.\n The various propositions are so intermingled as to cause it to be difficult to classify them. We are of opinion, however, \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n that the confusion is not inherent, but rather arises from the conclusion that the 16th Amendment provides for a hitherto unknown power of taxation; that is, a power to levy an income tax which, although direct, should not be subject to the regulation of apportionment applicable to all other direct taxes. And the far-reaching effect of this erroneous assumption will be made clear by generalizing the many contentions advanced in argument to support it, as follows: (a) The Amendment authorizes only a particular character of direct tax without apportionment, and therefore if a tax is levied under its assumed authority which does not partake of the characteristics exacted by the Amendment, it is outside of the Amendment, and is void as a direct tax in the general constitutional sense because not apportioned. (b) As the Amendment authorizes a tax only upon incomes 'from whatever source derived,' the exclusion from taxation of some income of designated persons and classes is not authorized, and hence the constitutionality of the law must be tested by the general provisions of the Constitution as to taxation, and thus again the tax is void for want of apportionment. (c) As the right to tax 'incomes from whatever source derived' for which the Amendment provides must be considered as exacting intrinsic uniformity, therefore no tax comes under the authority of the Amendment not conforming to such standard, and hence all the provisions of the assailed statute must once more be tested solely under the general and pre-existing provisions of the Constitution, causing the statute again to be void in the absence of apportionment. (d) As the power conferred by the Amendment is new and prospective, the attempt in the statute to make its provisions retroactively apply is void because, so far as the retroactive period is concerned, it is governed by the pre-existing constitutional requirement as to apportionment.\n But it clearly results that the proposition and the contentions \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n under it, if acceded to, would cause one provision of the Constitution to destroy another; that is, they would result in bringing the provisions of the Amendment exempting a direct tax from apportionment into irreconcilable conflict with the general requirement that all direct taxes be apportioned. Moreover, the tax authorized by the Amendment, being direct, would not come under the rule of uniformity applicable under the Constitution to other than direct taxes, and thus it would come to pass that the result of the Amendment would be to authorize a particular direct tax not subject either to apportionment or to the rule of geographical uniformity, thus giving power to impose a different tax in one state or states than was levied in another state or states. This result, instead of simplifying the situation and making clear the limitations on the taxing power, which obviously the Amendment must have been intended to accomplish, would create radical and destructive changes in our constitutional system and multiply confusion.\n But let us by a demonstration of the error of the fundamental proposition as to the significance of the Amendment dispel the confusion necessarily arising from the arguments deduced from it. Before coming, however, to the text of the Amendment, to the end that its significance may be determined in the light of the previous legislative and judicial history of the subject with which the Amendment is concerned, and with a knowledge of the conditions which presumptively led up to its adoption, and hence of the purpose it was intended to accomplish, we make a brief statement on those subjects.\n That the authority conferred upon Congress by  8 of article 1 'to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises' is exhaustive and embraces every conceivable power of taxation has never been questioned, or, if it has, has been so often authoritatively declared as to render it necessary only to state the doctrine. And it has also never \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n been questioned from the foundation, without stopping presently to determine under which of the separate headings the power was properly to be classed, that there was authority given, as the part was included in the whole, to lay and collect income taxes. Again, it has never moreover been questioned that the conceded complete and all-embracing taxing power was subject, so far as they were respectively applicable, to limitations resulting from the requirements of art. 1,  8, cl. 1, that 'all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States,' and to the limitations of art I.,  2, cl. 3, that 'direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states,' and of art 1,  9, cl. 4, that 'no capitation, or other direct, tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken.' In fact, the two great subdivisions embracing the complete and perfect delegation of the power to tax and the two correlated limitations as to such power were thus aptly stated by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. 157 U. S. supra, at page 557: 'In the matter of taxation, the Constitution recognizes the two great classes of direct and indirect taxes, and lays down two rules by which their imposition must be governed, namely: The rule of apportionment as to direct taxes, and the rule of uniformity as to duties, imposts, and excises.' It is to be observed, however, as long ago pointed out in Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 541, 19 L. ed. 482, 485, that the requirements of apportionment as to one of the great classes and of uniformity as to the other class were not so much a limitation upon the complete and all-embracing authority to tax, but in their essence were simply regulations concerning the mode in which the plenary power was to be exerted. In the whole history of the government down to the time of the adoption of the 16th Amendment, leaving aside some conjectures expressed of the possibility of a tax lying intermediate between the two great classes and embraced \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n by neither, no question has been anywhere made as to the correctness of these propositions. At the very beginning, however, there arose differences of opinion concerning the criteria to be applied in determining in which of the two great subdivisions a tax would fall. Without pausing to state at length the basis of these differences and the consequences which arose from them, as the whole subject was elaborately reviewed in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. \n157 U.S. 429\n, 39 L. ed. 759, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673, \n158 U.S. 601\n, 39 L. ed. 1108, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 912, we make a condensed statement which is in substance taken from what was said in that case. Early the differences were manifested in pressing on the one hand and opposing on the other, the passage of an act levying a tax without apportionment on carriages 'for the conveyance of persons,' and when such a tax was enacted the question of its repugnancy to the Constitution soon came to this court for determination. Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171, 1 L. ed. 556. It was held that the tax came within the class of excises, duties, and imposts, and therefore did not require apportionment, and while this conclusion was agreed to by all the members of the court who took part in the decision of the case, there was not an exact coincidence in the reasoning by which the conclusion was sustained. Without stating the minor differences, it may be said with substantial accuracy that the divergent reasoning was this: On the one hand, that the tax was not in the class of direct taxes requiring apportionment, because it was not levied directly on property because of its ownership, but rather on its use, and was therefore an excise, duty, or impost; and on the other, that in any event the class of direct taxes included only taxes directly levied on real estate because of its ownership. Putting out of view the difference of reasoning which led to the concurrent conclusion in the Hylton Case, it is undoubted that it came to pass in legislative practice that the line of demarcation between the two great classes of direct taxes on the one hand and excises, duties, and \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n imposts on the other, which was exemplified by the ruling in that case, was accepted and acted upon. In the first place this is shown by the fact that wherever (and there were a number of cases of that kind) a tax was levied directly on real estate or slaves because of ownership, it was treated as coming within the direct class and apportionment was provided for, while no instance of apportionment as to any other kind of tax is afforded. Again the situation is aptly illustrated by the various acts taxing incomes derived from property of every kind and nature which were enacted beginning in 1861, and lasting during what may be termed the Civil War period. It is not disputable that these latter taxing laws were classed under the head of excises, duties, and imposts because it was assumed that they were of that character inasmuch as, although putting a tax burden on income of every kind, including that derived from property real or personal, they were not taxes directly on property because of its ownership. And this practical construction came in theory to be the accepted one, since it was adopted without dissent by the most eminent of the text writers. 1 Kent, Com. 254, 256; 1 Story, Const.  955; Cooley, Const. Lim. 5th ed. *480; Miller, Constitution, 237; Pom. Const. Law,  281; 1 Hare, Const. Law, 249, 250; Burroughs, Taxn. 502; Ordronaux, Constitutional Legislation, 225.\n Upon the lapsing of a considerable period after the repeal of the income tax laws referred to, in 1894 [28 Stat. at L. 509, chap. 349], an act was passed laying a tax on incomes from all classes of property and other sources of revenue which was not apportioned, and which therefore was of course assumed to come within the classification of excises, duties, and imposts which were subject to the rule of uniformity, but not to the rule of apportionment. The constitutional validity of this law was challenged on the ground that it did not fall within the class of excises, duties, and imposts, \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n but was direct in the constitutional sense, and was therefore void for want of apportionment, and that question came to this court and was passed upon in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. \n157 U.S. 429\n, 39 L. ed. 759, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673, \n158 U.S. 601\n, 39 L. ed. 1108, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 912. The court, fully recognizing in the passage which we have previously quoted the allembracing character of the two great classifications, including, on the one hand, direct taxes subject to apportionment, and on the other, excises, duties, and imposts subject to uniformity, held the law to be unconstitutional in substance for these reasons: Concluding that the classification of direct was adopted for the purpose of rendering it impossible to burden by taxation accumulations of property, real or personal, except subject to the regulation of apportionment, it was held that the duty existed to fix what was a direct tax in the constitutional sense so as to accomplish this purpose contemplated by the Constitution. ( \n157 U.S. 581\n.) Coming to consider the validity of the tax from this point of view, while not questioning at all that in common understanding it was direct merely on income and only indirect on property, it was held that, considering the substance of things, it was direct on property in a constitutional sense, since to burden an income by a tax was, from the point of substance, to burden the property from which the income was derived, and thus accomplish the very thing which the provision as to apportionment of direct taxes was adopted to prevent. As this conclusion but enforced a regulation as to the mode of exercising power under particular circumstances, it did not in any way dispute the all-embracing taxing authority possessed by Congress, including necessarily therein the power to impose income taxes if only they conformed to the constitutional regulations which were applicable to them. Moreover, in addition, the conclusion reached in the Pollock Case did not in any degree involve holding that income taxes generically and necessarily came within the class \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n of direct taxes on property, but, on the contrary, recognized the fact that taxation on income was in its nature an excise entitled to be enforced as such unless and until it was concluded that to enforce it would amount to accomplishing the result which the requirement as to apportionment of direct taxation was adopted to prevent, in which case the duty would arise to disregard form and consider substance alone, and hence subject the tax to the regulation as to apportionment which otherwise as an excise would not apply to it. Nothing could serve to make this clearer than to recall that in the Pollock Case, in so far as the law taxed incomes from other classes of property than real estate and invested personal property, that is, income from 'professions, trades, employments, or vocations' (\n158 U.S. 637\n), its validity was recognized; indeed, it was expressly declared that no dispute was made upon that subject, and attention was called to the fact that taxes on such income had been sustained as excise taxes in the past. Id. p. 635. The whole law was, however, declared unconstitutional on the ground that to permit it to thus operate would relieve real estate and invested personal property from taxation and 'would leave the burden of the tax to be borne by professions, trades, employments, or vacations; and in that way what was intended as a tax on capital would remain, in substance, a tax on occupations and labor' ( id. p. 637),-a result which, it was held, could not have been contemplated by Congress.\n This is the text of the Amendment:\n'The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.'\n\n It is clear on the face of this text that it does not purport to confer power to levy income taxes in a generic sense,-an authority already possessed and never questioned, \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n -or to limit and distinguish between one kind of income taxes and another, but that the whole purpose of the Amendment was to relieve all income taxes when imposed from apportionment from a consideration of the source whence the income was derived. Indeed, in the light of the history which we have given and of the decision in the Pollock Case, and the ground upon which the ruling in that case was based, there is no escape from the conclusion that the Amendment was drawn for the purpose of doing away for the future with the principle upon which the Pollock Case was decided; that is, of determining whether a tax on income was direct not by a consideration of the burden placed on the taxed income upon which it directly operated, but by taking into view the burden which resulted on the property from which the income was derived, since in express terms the Amendment provides that income taxes, from whatever source the income may be derived, shall not be subject to the regulation of apportionment. From this in substance it indisputably arises, first, that all the contentions which we have previously noticed concerning the assumed limitations to be implied from the language of the Amendment as to the nature and character of the income taxes which it authorizes find no support in the text and are in irreconcilable conflict with the very purpose which the Amendment was adopted to accomplish. Second, that the contention that the Amendment treats a tax on income as a direct tax although it is relieved from apportionment and is necessarily therefore not subject to the rule of uniformity as such rule only applies to taxes which are not direct, thus destroying the two great classifications which have been recognized and enforced from the beginning, is also wholly without foundation since the command of the Amendment that all income taxes shall not be subject to apportionment by a consideration of the sources from which the taxed income may be derived \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n forbids the application to such taxes of the rule applied in the Pollock Case by which alone such taxes were removed from the great class of excises, duties, and imposts subject to the rule of uniformity, and were placed under the other or direct class. This must be unless it can be said that although the Constitution, as a result of the Amendment, in express terms excludes the criterion of source of income, that criterion yet remains for the purpose of destroying the classifications of the Constitution by taking an excise out of the class to which it belongs and transferring it to a class in which it cannot be placed consistently with the requirements of the Constitution. Indeed, from another point of view, the Amendment demonstrates that no such purpose was intended, and on the contrary shows that it was drawn with the object of maintaining the limitations of the Constitution and harmonizing their operation. We say this because it is to be observed that although from the date of the Hylton Case, because of statements made in the opinions in that case, it had come to be accepted that direct taxes in the constitutional sense were confined to taxes levied directly on real estate because of its ownership, the Amendment contains nothing repudiation or challenging the ruling in the Pollock Case that the word 'direct' had a broader significance, since it embraced also taxes levied directly on personal property because of its ownership, and therefore the Amendment at least impliedly makes such wider significance a part of the Constitution,-a condition which clearly demonstrates that the purpose was not to change the existing interpretation except to the extent necessary to accomplish the result intended; that is, the prevention of the resort to the sources from which a taxed income was derived in order to cause a direct tax on the income to be a direct tax on the source itself, and thereby to take an income tax out of the class of excises, duties, and imposts, and place it in the class of direct taxes. \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n We come, then, to ascertain the merits of the many contentions made in the light of the Constitution as it now stands; that is to say, including within its terms the provisions of the 16th Amendment as correctly interpreted. We first dispose of two propositions assailing the validity of the statute on the one hand because of its repugnancy to the Constitution in other respects, and especially because its enactment was not authorized by the 16th Amendment.\n The statute was enacted October 3, 1913, and provided for a general yearly income tax from December to December of each year. Exceptionally, however, it fixed a first period embracing only the time from March 1, to December 31, 1913, and this limited retroactivity is assailed as repugnant to the due process clause of the 5th Amendment, and as inconsistent with the 16th Amendment itself. But the date of the retroactivity did not extend beyond the time when the Amendment was operative, and there can be no dispute that there was power by virtue of the Amendment during that period to levy the tax, without apportionment, and so far as the limitations of the Constitution in other respects are concerned, the contention is not open, since in Stockdale v. Atlantic Ins. Co. 20 Wall. 323, 331, 22 L. ed. 348, 351, in sustaining a provision in a prior income tax law which was assailed because of its retroactive character, it was said:\n'The right of Congress to have imposed this tax by a new statute, although the measure of it was governed by the income of the past year, cannot be doubted; much less can it be doubted that it could impose such a tax on the income of the current year, though part of that year had elapsed when the statute was passed. The joint resolution of July 4th, 1864 [13 Stat. at L. 417], imposed a tax of 5 per cent upon all income of the previous year, although one tax on it had already been paid, and no one doubted the validity of the tax or attempted to resist it.' \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n The statute provides that the tax should not apply to enumerated organizations or corporations, such as labor, agricultural or horticultural organizations, mutual savings banks, etc., and the argument is that as the Amendment authorized a tax on incomes 'from whatever source derived,' by implication it excluded the power to make these exemptions. But this is only a form of expressing the erroneous contention as to the meaning of the Amendment, which we have already disposed of. And so far as this alleged illegality is based on other provisions of the Constitution, the contention is also not open, since it was expressly considered and disposed of in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. \n220 \nU.S. 108, 173\n, 55 S. L. ed. 389, 422, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312\n\n\n\n Without expressly stating all the other contentions, we summarize them to a degree adequate to enable us to typify and dispose of all of them.\n\n 1. \nThe statute levies one tax called a normal tax on all incomes of individuals up to $20,000, and from that amount up, by gradations, a progressively increasing tax, called an additional tax, is imposed. No tax, however, is levied upon incomes of unmarried individuals amounting to $3, 000 or less, nor upon incomes of married persons amounting to $4,000 or less. The progressive tax and the exempted amounts, it is said, are based on wealth alone, and the tax is therefore repugnant to the due process clause of the 5th Amendment.\n\n 2. \nThe act provides for collecting the tax at the source; that is, makes it the duty of corporations, etc., to retain and pay the sum of the tax on interest due on bonds and mortgages, unless the owner to whom the interest is payable gives a notice that he claims an exemption. This duty cast upon corporations, because of the cost to which they are subjected, is asserted to be repugnant to due process of law as a taking of their property without compensation, and we recapitulate various contentions as to discrimination against corporations and against individuals, \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n predicated on provisions of the act dealing with the subject.\n\n\n (a)\n Corporations indebted upon coupon and registered bonds are discriminated against, since corporations not so indebted are relieved of any labor or expense involved in deducting and paying the taxes of individuals on the income derived from bonds.\n\n\n (b)\n Of the class of corporations indebted as above stated, the law further discriminates against those which have assumed the payment of taxes on their bonds, since although some or all of their bondholders may be exempt from taxation, the corporations have no means of ascertaining such fact, and it would therefore result that taxes would often be paid by such corporations when no taxes were owing by the individuals to the government.\n\n\n (c)\n The law discriminates against owners of corporate bonds in favor of individuals none of whose income is derived from such property, since bondholders are, during the interval between the deducting and the paying of the tax on their bonds, deprived of the use of the money so withheld.\n\n\n (d)\n Again, corporate bondholders are discriminated against because the law does not release them from payment of taxes on their bonds even after the taxes have been deducted by the corporation, and therefore if, after deduction, the corporation should fail, the bondholders would be compelled to pay the tax a second time.\n\n\n (e)\n Owners of bonds the taxes on which have been assumed by the corporation are discriminated against because the payment of the taxes by the corporation does not relieve the bondholders of their duty to include the income from such bonds in making a return of all income, the result being a double payment of the taxes, labor and expense in applying for a refund, and a deprivation of the use of the sum of the taxes during the interval which elapses before they are refunded. \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n 3. The provision limiting the amount of interest paid which may be deducted from gross income of corporations for the purpose of fixing the taxable income to interest on indebtedness not exceeding one half the sum of bonded indebtedness and paidup capital stock is also charged to be wanting in due process because discriminating between different classes of corporations and individuals.\n\n 4. \nIt is urged that want of due process results from the provision allowing individuals to deduct from their gross income dividends paid them by corporations whose incomes are taxed, and not giving such right of deduction to corporations.\n\n 5. \nWant of due process is also asserted to result from the fact that the act allows a deduction of $3,000 or $4,000 to those who pay the normal tax, that is, whose incomes are $20,000 or less, and does not allow the deduction to those whose incomes are greater than $20,000; that is, such persons are not allowed, for the purpose of the additional or progressive tax, a second right to deduct the $3,000 or $4,000 which they have already enjoyed. And a further violation of due process is based on the fact that for the purpose of the additional tax no second right to deduct dividends received from corporations is permitted.\n\n 6. \nIn various forms of statement, want of due process, it is moreover insisted, arises from the provisions of the act allowing a deduction for the purpose of ascertaining the taxable income of stated amounts, on the ground that the provisions discriminate between married and single people, and discriminate between husbands and wives who are living together and those who are not.\n\n 7. \nDiscrimination and want of due process result, it is said, from the fact that the owners of houses in which they live are not compelled to estimate the rental value in making up their incomes, while those who are living in rented houses and pay rent are not allowed, in making up their taxable income, to deduct rent which they have \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n paid, and that want of due process also results from the fact that although family expenses are not, as a rule, permitted to be deducted from gross, to arrive at taxable, income, farmers are permitted to omit from their income return certain products of the farm which are susceptible of use by them for sustaining their families during the year.\n So far as these numerous and minute, not to say in many respects hypercritical, contentions are based upon an assumed violation of the uniformity clause, their want of legal merit is at once apparent, since it is settled that that clause exacts only a geographical uniformity, and there is not a semblance of ground in any of the propositions for assuming that a violation of such uniformity is complained of.

Rep. 421.\n So far as the due process clause of the 5th Amendment is relied upon, it suffices to say that there is no basis for such reliance, since it is equally well settled that such clause is not a limitation upon the taxing power conferred upon Congress by the Constitution; in other words, that the Constitution does not conflict with itself by conferring, upon the one hand, a taxing power, and taking the same power away, on the other, by the limitations of the due process clause. Treat v. White, \n181 U.S. 264\n, 45 L. ed. 853, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611; Patton v. Brady, \n184 U.S. 608\n, 46 L. ed. 713, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493; McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27, 61\n, 49 S.

United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261, 282\n, 58 S. L. ed. 596, 605, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 421. And no change in the situation here would arise even if it be conceded, as we think it must be, that this doctrine would have no application in a case where, although there was a seeming exercise of the taxing power, the act complained of was so arbitrary as to constrain to the conclusion that it was not the exertion of taxation, but a confiscation of property; that is, a taking \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n of the same in violation of the 5th Amendment; or, what is equivalent thereto, was so wanting in basis for classification as to produce such a gross and patent inequality as to inevitably lead to the same conclusion. We say this because none of the propositions relied upon in the remotest degree present such questions. It is true that it is elaborately insisted that although there be no express constitutional provision prohibiting it, the progressive feature of the tax causes it to transcend the conception of all taxation and to be a mere arbitrary abuse of power which must be treated as wanting in due process. But the proposition disregards the fact that in the very early history of the government a progressive tax was imposed by Congress, and that such authority was exerted in some, if not all, of the various income taxes enacted prior to 1894 to which we have previously adverted. And over and above all this the contention but disregards the further fact that its absolute want of foundation in reason was plainly pointed out in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747, and the right to urge it was necessarily foreclosed by the ruling in that case made. In this situation it is, of course, superfluous to say that arguments as to the expediency of levying such taxes, or of the economic mistake or wrong involved in their imposition, are beyond judicial cognizance. Besides this demonstration of the want of merit in the contention based upon the progressive feature of the tax, the error in the others is equally well established either by prior decisions or by the adequate bases for classification which are apparent on the face of the assailed provisions; that is, the distinction between individuals and corporations, the difference between various kinds of corporations, etc., etc. Ibid.; Flint v.

In fact, comprehensively surveying all the contentions \n\n[240 U.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n relied upon, aside from the erroneous construction of the Amendment which we have previously disposed of, we cannot escape the conclusion that they all rest upon the mistaken theory that although there be differences between the subjects taxed, to differently tax them transcends the limit of taxation and amounts to a want of due process, and that where a tax levied is believed by one who resists its enforcement to be wanting in wisdom and to operate injustice, from that fact in the nature of things there arises a want of due process of law and a resulting authority in the judiciary to exceed its powers and correct what is assumed to be mistaken or unwise exertions by the legislative authority of its lawful powers, even although there be no semblance of warrant in the Constitution for so doing.\n We have not referred to a contention that because certain administrative powers to enforce the act were conferred by the statute upon the Secretary of the Treasury, therefore it was void as unwarrantedly delegating legislative authority, because we think to state the proposition is to answer it.

STATE OF WISCONSIN(1916)\nNo. 262\nArgued: March 8, 1916Decided: April 10, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 625, 626]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John R. Montgomery, Louis E. Hart, Jasperson Smith, and Lloyd R. Steere for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 625, 629]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter Drew and Mr. Walter C. Owen, Attorney General of Wisconsin, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a proceeding to fix the inheritance tax upon the estate of George Bullen, deceased, a resident of Wisconsin. The supreme court of the state affirmed a judgment for a tax upon a fund of nearly a million dollars which the heirs and next of kin say cannot be taxed in Wisconsin without violating the 14th Amendment and the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States. 143 Wis. 512, 139 Am. St. Rep. 1114, 128 N. W. 109.\n The facts are simple. Bullen formery had lived in Chicago, and continued to do some business there after moving to Wisconsin, which he did in 1892. He kept in Chicago the bonds, stocks, and notes constituting the fund, and in 1902 conveyed them to the Northern Trust Company of that city upon certain trusts. In 1904, by virtue of powers reserved, he repossessed himself of the fund, but in 1907 he conveyed it to the company upon the former trusts again. The limitations, so far as material, were of relatively small sums to a sister and niece residing in Massachusetts, and, subject to those gifts of one third of the income to his widow for life and the rest of the income and the principal to his four sons. But the instrument contained the following clause: 'Fifth. I. the donor, expressly reserve the right to direct and control the disposition of the said trust property and estate, to revoke and vacate this trust at any time during my life, to enter into and upon and take possession of the same, or any part thereof, to require a reconveyance to me of the said trust property, or any part thereof, and to dispose of it as I may see fit. During my lifetime the principal and income shall be used for such beneficiaries \n\n[240 U.S. 625, 630]\n\u00a0\n and in such manner as I may from time to time appoint, and in default of any appointment during my lifetime, and, at all events, after my death, the said income and the said principal shall be applied, paid over or held as herein provided.' It also declared that no portion of principal or income should be paid under some of the leading clauses before Bullen's death, unless by his direction. In fact, be received the whole income during his life. The supreme court held that an inheritance tax was due in respect of the whole fund as upon a transfer intended to take effect in enjoyment after the donor's death.\n The deeds of trust were not a merely simulated transaction. Bullen made a will shortly after the first transfer, which was of similar tenor, but which, it is found, 'has not been probated.' perhaps because the parties relied upon the deeds. The deeds transferred title and they had a purpose. Bullen at the time was suffering from locomotor ataxia, his wife also was in precarious health, and the chief instrument contemplated the possible disability of both. The ultimate limitations would operate unless revoked, which they were not. But Bullen, as has been seen, reserved an absolute power of control over all of his gifts, and exercised it during his life by a revocation (followed, to be sure, by a reconveyance upon the same terms), and by taking all the income of the fund. The words of Lord St. Leonards apply with full force to the present attempt to escape the Wisconsin inheritance tax: 'To take a distinction between a general power and a limitation in fee is to grasp at a shadow while the substance escapes.' Sugden, Powers, 8th ed. 396. See Gray, Perpetuities,  526b, 1st ed. pp. 334, 335. We do not speak of evasion, because, when the law draws a line, a case is on one side of it or the other, and if on the safe side is none the worse legally that a party has availed himself to the full of what the law permits. When an act is condemned as an evasion, what is meant is that it \n\n[240 U.S. 625, 631]\n\u00a0\n is on the wrong side of the line indicated by the policy if not by the mere letter of the law. What we do say is that the supreme court of Wisconsin was fully justified in treating Bullen's general power of disposition as equivalent to a fee for the purposes of the taxing statute, that there is no constitutional objection to its doing so, and that although Illinois also has taxed the fund, as it might, we are not aware that it has attempted to qualify the effect that Wisconsin has given to the power, and do not intimate that it could have done so, if it had tried. See Hawley v. Malden, \n232 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 58 S. L. ed. 477, 483, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 201.\n The power to tax is not limited in the same way as the power to affect the transfer of property. If this fund had passed by intestate succession, it would be recognized that by the traditions of our law the property is regarded as a universitas the succession to which is incident to the succession to the persona of the deceased. As the states where the property is situated, if governed by the common law, generally recognize the law of the domicil as determining the succession, it may be said that, in a practical sense at least, the law of the domicil is needed to establish the inheritance. Therefore the inheritance may be taxed at the place of domicil, whatever the limitations of power over the specific chattels may be, as is especially plain in the case of contracts and stock.

Norcross v. James, 140 Mass. 188, 2 N. E. 946. The principle that allows the tax is to be \n\n[240 U.S. 625, 632]\n\u00a0\n applied, if ever, to a disposition that operates upon the great mass of the donor's estate, and that takes effect only upon his death; at least, so far as concerns the persons before this court, the donor's widow and sons. Lines's Estate, 155 Pa. 378, 26 Atl. 728.\n It is suggested that there was a subordinate error in not deducting the amount of the Illinois inheritance tax. But this appears not to have been assigned in the appeal to the Supreme Court of the state, and therefore we need not inquire whether there was any constitutional obstacle to the state of Wisconsin adopting the gross fund disposed of rather than the net amount received as the measure of the tax.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBUTLER v.

Every able-bodied male person over the age of twenty-one years, and under the age of forty-five years, residing in said county for thirty days or more continuously next prior to the date of making of the list by the board of county commissioners, or the date of the summons or notice to work, shall be subject, liable and required to work on the roads and bridges of the several counties for six days of not less than ten hours each in each year when summoned so to do, as herein provided; that such persons so subject to road duty may perform such services by an able- bodied substitute over the age of eighteen years, or in lieu thereof may pay to the road overseer on or before the day he is called upon to render such service the sum of $3, and such overseer shall turn into the county treasury of his county any and all moneys so paid to him, the same to be placed to the \n\n[240 U.S. 328, 330]\n\u00a0\n credit of the road and bridge fund and subject to the order of the board of county commissioners for road and bridge purposes; . . .\n\n'Sec. 12. Any person or persons not exempt as aforesaid who shall fail to work on public roads of the several counties when required to do so, or to provide a substitute as herein provided, and shall neglect or refuse to make payment for the same, as hereinbefore provided, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not more than $ 50 or imprisoned in the county jail for not longer than thirty days.'\n\n Plaintiff in error was convicted in the county judge's court, Columbia county, upon a charge of failing to work on a road, and sentenced to jail for thirty days. The circuit court granted a writ of habeas corpus; he was heard, remanded to the custody of the sheriff, and then released under bond. The supreme court of the state affirmed the action of the circuit court (67 Fla. 405, 66 So. 150), and the cause is here upon writ of error.\n It is insisted that  10 and 12, supra, are invalid because they undertake to impose involuntary servitude not as a punishment for crime, contrary to the 13th Amendment to the Federal Constitution; and also because their enforcement would deprive plaintiff of his liberty and property without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment.\n In view of ancient usage and the unanimity of judicial opinion, it must be taken as settled that, unless restrained by some constitutional limitation, a state has inherent power to require every able-bodied man within its jurisdiction to labor for a reasonable time on public roads near his residence without direct compensation. This is a part of the duty which he owes to the public. The law of England is thus declared in Blackstone's Commentaries, bk. 1, page 357:\n'Every parish is bound of common right to keep the \n\n[240 U.S. 328, 331]\n\u00a0\n highroads that go through it in good and sufficient repair; unless by reason of the tenure of lands, or otherwise, this care is consigned to some particular private person. From this burthen no man was exempt by our ancient laws, whatever other immunities he might enjoy: this being part of the trinoda necessitas, to which every man's estate was subject; viz., expeditio contra hostem, arcium constructio, et pontium reparatio. For, though the reparation of bridges only is expressed, yet that of roads also must be understood; as in the Roman law, with respect to the construction and repairing of ways and bridges no class of men of whatever rank or dignity should be exempted.'\n\n The trinoda necessitas was an obligation falling on all freemen, or at least on all free householders. Vinogradoff, English Society in the Eleventh Century, p. 82.\n From Colonial days to the present time conscripted labor has been much relied on for the construction and maintenance of roads. The system was introduced from England, and, while it has produced no Appian Way, appropriateness to the circumstances existing in rural communities gave it general favor.

[1 Stat. at L. 53, note.] \n\n[240 U.S. 328, 332]\n\u00a0\n In 1792 the territorial legislative body passed an act providing: 'That every male inhabitant of sixteen years of age and upwards on being duly warned to work on the highways by the supervisor in the township to which such inhabitant may belong shall repair to the place and at the time by the said supervisor appointed with such utensils and tools as may be ordered him wherewith he is to labour and there abide and obey the direction of such supervisor during the day in opening and repairing the highway.' (Sec. 5, chapter IV., Laws passed from July to December, 1792, Laws of the Territory Northwest of the Ohio, 1788-1798.) An act of the general assembly of the territory passed in 1799, declared: 'That all male persons of the age of twenty-one years, and not exceeding fifty, who have resided thirty days in any township of any county within this territory, who are not a township charge, shall over and above the rate of assessment hereinafter mentioned, be liable, yearly and every year, to do and perform two days' work on the public roads, under the direction of the supervisor within whose limits they shall be respectively residents.' (Sec. 10, chapter 28 of Northwest Territory Acts 1799.)\n By their several Constitutions the states within the limits of the Northwest Territory prohibited involuntary servitude substantially in the language of the 1787 ordinance, and with the possible exception of Wisconsin, all of them early enacted and long enforced laws requiring labor upon public roads.\n Utilizing the language of the ordinance of 1787, the 13th Amendment declares that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist. This Amendment was adopted with reference to conditions existing since the foundation of our government, and the term 'involuntary servitude' was intended to cover those forms of compulsory labor akin to African slavery which, in practical operation, would tend to produce like undesirable results. \n\n[240 U.S. 328, 333]\n\u00a0\n It introduced no novel doctrine with respect of services always treated as exceptional, and certainly was not intended to interdict enforcement of those duties which individuals owe to the state, such as services in the army, militia, on the jury, etc. The great purpose in view was liberty under the protection of effective government, not the destruction of the latter by depriving it of essential powers.

Ample notice appears to have been given and disregarded. There was an orderly trial and conviction before a duly constituted tribunal for a plainly defined statutory offense, followed by a sentence not alleged to be unreasonable.\n We find no error in the judgment of the court below, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCARDONA v. QUINONES(1916)\nNo. 185\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. Jose R. F. Savage and Fernando Vazquez for appellant.\n Mr. Francis H. Dexter for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Both courts below rejected the claim of title made by the appellant to a tract of land of 40 cuerdas. As the \n\n[240 U.S. 83, 84]\n\u00a0\n appeal was prayed within the statutory time, the mere date of its allowance by the court is not controlling, and the motion to dismiss which proceeds upon a contrary assumption is therefore without foundation and is overruled. United States v. Vigil, 10 Wall. 423, 427, 19 L. ed. 954, 955.\n Obviously, upon the theory that our power to review was controlled by the rule obtaining as to territorial courts of the United States, this record, as was the case in Elzaburu v. Chaves, \n239 U.S. 283\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 47, contains a statement of facts prepared by the lower court for the purposes of this appeal. As there is an entire absence from the record of the oral and documentary evidence upon which the court below acted, except so far as the same may be shown by the opinion of the court, or may be contained in the statement of facts, it follows that the record does not enable us to review the facts, and we proceed to dispose of the legal propositions urged for reversal in the light of the facts as stated and as elucidated in the opinion of the court. Abbreviating and some what changing the order in which they are stated below, we recapitulate the essential facts as follows:\n Two brothers, Jose Salvador Suris and Ramon Maria Suris, having acquired by various acts of purchase 70 cuerdas of land in the ward of Sabana Eneas of San German, in November, 1870, executed a mortgage on 40 cuerdas of the land thus acquired, being the 40 cuerdas here in controversy, in favor of the Charity Hospital at San German. In 1879 the Charity Hospital commenced proceedings to foreclose this mortgage, but such proceedings were stayed until 1882 in consequence of an appeal taken to the Territorial Audiencia. After the cessation of the stay, in that year an attachment against 100 cuerdas of land belonging to the two brothers was levied and the property thus attached was placed (sequestered) in the hands of one Pablo Maria Stefani. On the same day, \n\n[240 U.S. 83, 85]\n\u00a0\n February 9, 1882, by a contract under private signature the two Suris brothers sold to Stefani the 40 cuerdas here in controversy which had been mortgaged to the hospital, the purchaser obligating himself to pay the hospital debt, and, if a surplus remained, to pay certain attorney's fees which had been incurred. The agreement also contained a conveyance to Stefani of another and distinct tract of land for another and distinct price. This agreement under private signature was never inscribed upon the public records. A few days after it was made, and presumably before the contract of sale had been carried out, the Suris brothers executed before a notary an act of consolidation of the various properties which they had acquired, which they described as 'Perseguida,' and this act was put upon the public records. Under the private agreement Stefani, the purchaser, went into possession and discharged the obligations of the private contract of sale.\n In 1888 a commercial firm, Schulze & Company, as creditors of the Succession of Stefani, who had in the meanwhile died, brought suit against his Succession to enforce its debt, and for the purpose of getting upon the records the possessory title of Stefani to enable an attachment to be levied, instituted and carried out the necessary proceedings. When the order for record was obtained, the property was levied upon and sold at a judicial sale and was bought in by Schulze & Company. After thus becoming the purchasers of the land in controversy, the firm in 1899 executed before a notary and put of record a deed consolidating into a plantation called 'Imisa' various tracts of land containing 192.30 cuerdas, the deed reciting that one of the parcels of land included in the plantation was a tract of 40 cuerdas called 'Hospital' or 'Perseguida.' Ramon Maria Suris, one of the original vendors, died in the meanwhile, and in 1900 his heirs put upon record a declaratory deed asserting their undivided ownership \n\n[240 U.S. 83, 86]\n\u00a0\n as the successors of their father to a tract of 40 cuerdas, known as 'Perseguida.'\n The Bank of Porto Rico, as the holder of a mortgage put upon the Imisa plantation by Schulze & Company, foreclosed the same and bought in the property in August, 1905, and in November of the following year (1906) the bank sold the plantation thus acquired to Francisco P. Quinones, the defendant, his title as purchaser having been inscribed upon the public records.\n In 1907 Jose Salvador Suris, one of the original vendors under the act of private sale, as well as the widow and heirs of his deceased brother, Ramon Maria Suris, the other original vendor, each executed deeds of sale of an undivided half interest in the property called 'Perseguida' to Juan Suris Cardona, a son of Jose, and these acts of sale were put upon the public registry. A few days later the parties vendor to the acts above stated executed another notarial act in which they declared that the property had not been in their possession, but in the possession of the defendant Quinones and the Bank of Porto Rico, and therefore they had not collected revenues, and they ceded to the purchaser the right to collect such revenues. Under the ownership alleged to result from these acts this suit was commenced by Cardona to recover the property.\n The findings in express terms establish that 'from 1882 the property sued for ceased to belong to the brothers Jose Salvador and Ramon Maria Suris by reason of the sale set out in the private contract, and since then it has been in the quiet, peaceful, and public possession, as owners, in good faith and by title of purchase of Stefani, later of Schulze & Company, then of the Banco de Puerto Rico, and finally of Quinones, residents of Porto Rico.' As to the purchase by Cardona, the plaintiff, from his father and the representatives of his deceased uncle, the findings expressly state: 'When the plaintiff purchased the property sought to be recovered he knew the \n\n[240 U.S. 83, 87]\n\u00a0\n history of it as here related and knew that his father and cousins had not possessed the same since the year 1882.' And the conclusion reached as to the ultimate facts on this subject is thus expressed in the opinion of the court below: 'In view of the manner in which the facts have occurred, we have no doubt whatever that the deeds of sale of the property in question executed in favor of Juan Suris Cardona have had no other purpose than that he should institute this suit to avail himself of and assert his rights as a third party and thus save his father and the heirs of his uncle from the consequences of the private document executed in favor of Stefani; and we are likewise convinced that the plaintiff knew the history of the said property before he made his purchase, and that his father and his cousins had not possessed the same since 1882, as stated in the complaint.'\n Applying the law to the facts stated, the court concluded: (a) 'Under such conditions the plaintiff cannot claim the benefits which the law grants to third parties, because nobody can be a third party who, although he had not intervened in the first contract of sale, purchased, however, knowing that his vendors were not the owners and had no possession of the property sold. The same doctrine has already been established by this court in the case of Voight v. Ribas, 1 Decisiones de Puerto Rico, 60, decided May 10, 1900.' [17 P. R. R. 642.] (b) From the possession which, as we have seen, the court found to have existed from 1882 in Stefani and his successors, Schulze & Company, the Bank of Porto Rico and Quinones, and the various titles which were put upon the record in the transfers as made, especially the inclusion of the property in the plantation 'Imisa,' it was held that between the parties there was a sufficient basis laid for a just title and possession as owner in good faith, adequate to sustain a prescription of ten years, which was upheld.\n The contentions for reversal are numerous and are \n\n[240 U.S. 83, 88]\n\u00a0\n greatly multiplied by their reiteration in somewhat changed form of statement under the very many propositions and subdivisions of propositions embraced in the elaborate printed argument, but we dispose of them as follows:\n First. Giving effect to the settled doctrine by which we do not disturb, but, on the contrary, uphold, the action of the court below as to matters concerning purely local law except upon conviction on our part of clear error committed (Nadal v. May, \n233 \nU.S. 447, 454\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1040, 1041, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611; Villanueva v. Villanueva, \n239 \nU.S. 293, 299\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 109), we at once dismiss from view the various contentions concerning the form of the pleadings, the question whether a default should not have been allowed as to the issues presented by certain amendments of the pleadings, the admissibility as between the parties or their successors or assigns of the act under private signature, either because of the asserted ambiguity of its terms or the inadequacy of the number of witnesses to its execution, and many other subjects of a kindred nature too numerous to be recapitulated.\n Second. We also at once put out of view the various contentions iterated and reiterated under every proposition which, while apparently accepting the findings, virtually dispute them, such as the contentions that the private instrument did not amount to a sale to Stefani because certain alleged bankruptcy proceedings referred to in the opinion of the court excluded the right of the Suris brothers at that time to sell the property, that no possession followed in Stefani from the making of the private sale because that instrument was one not importing possession in and of itself, without proof of manual tradition, and also numerous other contentions of a kindred character concerning the judicial proceedings taken by Schulze & Company to acquire title and the deed of consolidation by them recorded which we further do not stop to specifically point out. \n\n[240 U.S. 83, 89]\n\u00a0\n With these things disposed of, the remaining contentions come to this: That the decision of the court below was plainly violative of the local law known as the mortgage law, and the general provisions of the Code concerning the necessity of the public record of title to real estate and the protection afforded by the same, and that, moreover, an obvious disregard of the mortgage law and the provisions of the Code resulted from giving to the sale under private signature and the proceedings and subsequent transmutations of title based upon it the character of a just title sufficient on its face to be the basis of the ten years' prescription under the Code, which the court below upheld. But, when stripped of the confusion in the mode in which they are stated, and reduced to their ultimate significance, all the contentions on these subjects are exclusively based upon the assumption that the plaintiff below was entitled to the protection afforded by the mortgage law to third persons and to the assumed inadequacy of the title relied upon by the defendant to sustain the ten years' prescription as against a third person. The propositions, therefore, in their essence, when correctly understood, but ignore or dispute the findings of the court below upon which its conclusion was expressly based, that the plaintiff was not a third person, either because he was merely a person interposed as a means of enabling him apparently to assert in his own name, for the benefit of his authors in title, rights which they were incapable themselves of asserting, indeed, could not, without fraud on their part, enjoy, or because, if not in a strict sense a person interposed, he was nevertheless not a third person within the intendment of the local law, because he acquired with full knowledge of the want of title in his vendors and of the absence of possession on their part, and also with knowledge not only of an outstanding title, but of possession as owner which was then and had been enjoyed by the defendant and his predecessors in right. Thus to \n\n[240 U.S. 83, 90]\n\u00a0\n bring the propositions to the true basis upon which they rest serves at once, without more, to establish their absolute want of foundation, and to demonstrate the correctness of the judgment below and the duty to affirm it.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCAREY v. DONOHUE(1916)\nNo. 179\nArgued: January 17, 1916Decided: March 13, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 430, 431]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Morison R. Waite and John Randolph Schindel for appellant.\n Messrs. E. R. Donohue, David Davis, and W. G. Durrell for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was brought by a trustee in bankruptcy to set aside a transfer made by the bankrupt of certain real estate. Upon appeal from a decree in favor of the trustee, it was held by the circuit court of appeals that the case had been tried, and the decree was based, upon the theory of preference voidable under the bankruptcy act, and for the purpose of appropriate amendment to conform the bill to the proof, the decree was reversed and the cause was remanded. 126 C. C. A. 254, 209 Fed. 328. The amendment was made accordingly, and the decree was re-entered and affirmed. 129 C. C. A. 664, 213 Fed. 1021\n\n\n The petition in involuntary bankruptcy was filed on January 3, 1911, and the adjudication was had on January 24, 1911. The following facts appear from the findings: On August 6, 1910, John E. Humphreys (the bankrupt) executed and delivered to Walter J. Carey (the appellant) the deed in question. It was left for record on November 15, 1910, with the recording officer of the proper county, and was recorded. Humphreys was insolvent at the time of the execution of the deed, and Carey at that time had reasonable cause to believe that such transfer to him, if made, would effect a preference, being given in payment of an antecedent debt. On December 31, 1910, Carey conveyed the property to innocent purchasers, this deed being left for record on January 3, 1911. It was held that the latter conveyance placed the property itself beyond the reach of the court; and judgment was given in favor of the trustee and against Carey for the \n\n[240 U.S. 430, 432]\n\u00a0\n value of the property as found by a jury, with provision for the payment by the trustee to the wife of the bankrupt of the estimated value of her inchoate right of dower.\n We are not concerned with the provisions of the Ohio statute relating to preferences (General Code,  11,104, 11,105),-a statute which provides a different test of liability from that of  601 of the Federal act pursuant to which the recovery was had. (126 C. C. A. 254, 209 Fed. pp. 331, 332.) The sole question presented for the consideration of this court is whether the deed executed by the bankrupt was one which was 'required' to be recorded within the meaning of this section. If it was not, there could be no recovery of the property under  60, as the deed was \n\n[240 U.S. 430, 433]\n\u00a0\n executed and delivered more than four months before the petition in bankruptcy was filed. If the deed was required to be recorded in the sense of the statute, it is clear that the trustee was entitled to recover, as the recording was within the four months' period and the other conditions of recovery were satisfied.\n The provision for the recording of the deed is found in  8543 of the General Code of Ohio, which follows the requirement for the recording of mortgages and powers of attorney. The section reads:\n'Section 8543. All other deeds and instruments of writing for the conveyance or encumbrance of lands, tenements, or hereditaments ditaments executed agreeably to the provisions of this chapter, shall be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county in which the premises are situated, and until so recorded or filed for record, they shall be deemed fraudulent, so far as relates to a subsequent bona fide purchaser having, at the time of purchase, no knowledge of the existence of such former deed or instrument.'\n\n Referring to this section, the supreme court of Ohio said in Dow v. Union Nat. Bank, 87 Ohio St. 173, 181, 100 N. E. 328: 'This provision of the statute must be accepted as exclusively defining the consequences which follow a failure to file a deed for record, and there being mere neglect, unaccompanied by any fraudulent conduct or representation on the part of the grantee, no right can accrue to anyone other than such bona fide purchaser.' Accordingly, it was held that the mere failure to record a deed did not render it invalid as to creditors of the grantor although they became such on the faith of his representation that he was still the owner of the property conveyed. This decision applied the ruling in Wright v. Franklin Bank, 59 Ohio St. 80, 92, 93, 51 N. E. 876, where it was said: 'Lands held by a properly executed but unrecorded deed are also free from the debts of the grantor, whether attempted \n\n[240 U.S. 430, 434]\n\u00a0\n to be reached in an assignment for the benefit of creditors made by him, or upon an attachment, judgment, or execution against him. The title under such a deed is good as against everything except a subsequent bona fide purchaser without notice. . . . Mortgages so executed, whether on an estate in real property or on only an interest therein, take effect from the time of the delivery to the recorder, and deeds so executed, conveying the estate or only an interest therein, that is, an equity, take effect from delivery, except as against subsequent bona fide purchasers without notice, and as against such the deed must be also recorded.' In the present case, the court of appeals was satisfied that in equity the instrument (which was absolute in form) should be treated as a mortgage, but the court did not think this to be important because of the holding of the Ohio court that an instrument in this form, 'unlike a legal mortgage, operates upon delivery to transfer title and so is required to be recorded as a deed.' 126 C. C. A. 260, 261, 209 Fed. pp. 334, 335; Kemper v. Campbell, 44 Ohio St. 210, 218, 6 N. E. 566; Wright v. Franklin Bank, 59 Ohio St. p. 95, 51 N. E. 876; Cole v. Merchants Nat. Bank, 15 Ohio C. C. ( N. S.) 315, 347.\n Under these decisions, then, we assume that there was no requirement that this conveyance should be recorded in order to give it validity as against any creditor of the bankrupt, whether a general creditor, or a lien creditor, or a judgment creditor with execution returned unsatisfied; that is, as against any class of persons represented by the trustee or with whose 'rights, remedies, and powers' he was to be deemed to be vested. Bankruptcy act,  47a. This fact, the appellant contends, makes recovery impossible under  60; while the appellees insist that the provision in the interest of subsequent bona fide purchasers constitutes a requirement of recording which entitles a trustee to recover for the benefit of creditors. With respect to the construction of the \n\n[240 U.S. 430, 435]\n\u00a0\n clause in question, there has been diversity of opinion in the circuit courts of appeals. In the sixth, seventh, and eighth circuits, the view has been taken that the word 'required' refers 'to the character of the instrument giving the preference' without regard to the persons in whose favor the requirement is imposed; that is, if the transfer is required to be recorded as to anyone, the trustee may recover if it has not been recorded more than four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. See Loeser v. Savings Deposit Bank & T. Co. (C. C. A. Sixth) 18 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1233, 78 C. C. A. 597, 148 Fed. 975, 979 (followed by the decision in the present case); Re Beckhaus (C. C. A. Seventh) 100 C. C. A. 561, 177 Fed. 141 (see Re Sturtevant [C. C. A. Seventh] 110 C. C. A. 68, 188 Fed. 196); First Nat. Bank v. Connett (C. C. A. Eighth) 5 L.R.A.(N.S.) 148, 73 C. C. A. 219, 142 Fed. 33, 36; Mattley v. Giesler (C. C. A. Eighth) 110 C. C. A. 90, 187 Fed. 970, 971. A different conclusion has been reached in the second, fifth, and ninth circuits. See Re Boyd (C. C. A. Second) 130 C. C. A. 288, 213 Fed. 774; Meyer Bros. Drug Co. v. Pipkin Drug Co. (C. C. A. Fifth) 69 C. C. A. 240, 136 Fed. 396; Re McIntosh (C. C. A. Ninth) 80 C. C. A. 250, 150 Fed. 546; also Re Hunt (D. C. N. Y.) 139 Fed. 283.\n In its original form,  60 made no reference to record. 30 Stat. at L. 562, chap. 541, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9644. The four months ran from the time of the giving of the preference, and if this period had elapsed when the bankruptcy proceeding was instituted, there could be no recovery under  60, whether the transfer had, or had not, been recorded. See Humphrey v. Tatman, \n198 U.S. 91\n, 49 L. ed. 956, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 567; Rogers v. Page, 72 C. C. A. 164, 140 Fed. 596, 599. But a different rule was established for computing the time within which a petition in bankruptcy might be filed. In  3b, it was provided that the four months' period should not expire 'until four months after (1) the date of the recording or registering of the transfer . . . when the act consists in having made a transfer . . . for the purpose of giving a preference . . . if by \n\n[240 U.S. 430, 436]\n\u00a0\n law such recording or registering is required or permitted, or, if it is not, from the date when the beneficiary takes notorious, exclusive, or continuous possession of the property unless the petitioning creditors have received actual notice of such transfer.' 30 Stat. at L. 546, 547, chap. 541, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9587. This distinction between the test of the right to institute bankruptcy proceedings and the test of the right to recover from one who had received a transfer alleged to be a preference lay in the terms of the act and could not rightly be ignored. It was urged that the result was to encourage secret preferential transactions; but the wisdom of the prescribed condition of recovery from the preferred creditor, and the advisability of conforming the provision of  60 to that of  3b was a matter for legislative, not judicial, consideration. To secure this conformity, an amendment to  60 was proposed in Congress in the year 1903. As passed by the House of Representatives, it added to  60a the following clause: 'Where the preference consists in a transfer, such period of four months shall not expire until four months after the date of the recording or registering of the transfer, if by law such recording or registering is required or permitted, or if not, from the date when the beneficiary takes notorious, exclusive, or continuous possession of the property transferred.' Cong. Rec. 57th Cong. 1st Sess. vol. 35, pt. 7, pp. 6938, 6943. The Senate struck from this proposed amendment all that follows the words, 'if by law such recording or registering is required,' and as thus limited the amendment was adopted by Congress. Cong. Rec. 57th Cong. 2d Sess. vol. 36, pt. 1, p. 1036; act of Feb. 5, 1903, chap. 487, 32 Stat. at L. 797, 799, 800, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9644; Re Hunt, 139 Fed. p. 286. There is no basis for the assumption that the words which the House of Representatives had desired to add were ultimately deemed to be surplusage, for these words had an obviously distinct significance and they had been included in  3b, which in this respect remained unchanged. \n\n[240 U.S. 430, 437]\n\u00a0\n We cannot but regard the action of Congress as a deliberate refusal to conform the requirements of  60 to those of  3b, and we are not at liberty to supply by construction what Congress has clearly shown its intention to omit. It should also be observed that  60 was again under consideration by Congress in the year 1910, and it was again amended [36 Stat. at L. 842, chap. 412,  11, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9644]; but the last sentence of  60a, as inserted in 1903 was left unaltered. And the same conditional clause-'if by law recording or registering thereof is required'-was used in the amended subdivision b (ante, p. 432, note). Whatever argument is made for an extension of the clause, in order more completely to conform it to the language of  3b, we must disregard as addressed to a matter solely of legislative policy.\n As Congress did not undertake in  60 to hit all preferential transfers (otherwise valid) merely because they were not disclosed, either by record or possession, more than four months before the bankruptcy proceeding, the inquiry is simply as to the nature of the requirement of recording to which Congress referred. The character of the transfer itself, both with respect to what should constitute a transfer and its preferential effect, had been carefully defined. It is plain that the words are not limited to cases where recording is required for the purpose of giving validity to the transaction as between the parties. For that purpose, no amendment of the original act was needed, as in such a case there could be no giving of a preference without recording. But in dealing with a transfer, as defined, which, though valid as between the parties, was one which was 'required' to be recorded, the reference was necessarily to a requirement in the interest of others who were in the contemplation of Congress in enacting the provision. The natural, and, we think, the intended, meaning, was to embrace those cases in which recording was necessary in order to make the transfer valid as against those concerned in the distribution of \n\n[240 U.S. 430, 438]\n\u00a0\n the insolvent estate; that is, as against creditors, including those whose position the trustee was entitled to take. This gives effect to the amendment and interprets it in consonance with the spirit and purpose of the bankruptcy act. See Senate Report, No. 691, Sixty-first Cong. 2d Sess., p. 8. In the present case, there was no requirement of recording in favor of creditors, either general creditors or lien creditors. The requirement of the applicable law was solely in favor of subsequent bona fide purchasers without notice. These subsequent purchasers are entirely outside of the purview of the bankruptcy act. The proceeding in bankruptcy is not, in any sense, in their interest, and the trustee does not represent them. We can find no ground for the conclusion that the clause 'if by law recording or registering thereof is required' had any reference to requirements in the interest of persons of this description. The limitation of the provision to those transfers which are 'required' to be recorded under the applicable law is not to be taken to be an artificial one by which the rights of creditors are made to depend upon the presence or absence of local restrictions adopted, alio intuitu, in the interest of others. Rather, as we have said, we deem the reference to be to requirements of registry or record which have been established for the protection of creditors,-the persons interested in the bankrupt estate, and in whose behalf, or in whose place, the trustee is entitled to act. And where, as in this case, there is no such requirement, and the transfer was made more than four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, there can be no recovery under  60.\n In this view, the decree must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The applicable provisions of  60 are as follows:\n'Sec. 60. Preferred Creditors-a. A person shall be deemed to have given a preference if, being insolvent, he has, within four months before the filing of the petition, or after the filing of the petition and before the adjudication, procured or suffered a judgment to be entered against himself in favor of any person, or made a transfer of any of his property, and the effect of the enforcement of such judgment or transfer will be to enable any one of his creditors to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than any other of such creditors of the same class. Where the preference consists in a transfer, such period of four months shall not expire until four months after the date of the recording or registering of the transfer, if by law such recording or registering is required. [32 Stat. at L. 799, 800, chap. 487,  13, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9644.]\n\n'b. If a bankrupt shall have procured or suffered a judgment to be entered against him in favor of any person or have made a transfer of any of his property, and if, at the time of the transfer, or of the entry of the judgment, or of the recording or registering of the transfer if by law recording or registering thereof is required, and being within four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy or after the filing thereof and before the adjudication, the bankrupt be insolvent and the judgment or transfer then operate as a preference, and the person receiving it or to be benefited thereby, or his agent acting therein, shall then have reasonable cause to believe that the enforcement of such judgment or transfer would effect a preference, it shall be voidable by the trustee and he may recover the property or its value from such person.'

U S(1916)\nNo. 171\nArgued: January 21, 1916Decided: February 21, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 156, 157]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James H. Hayden for appellant.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 156, 159]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson for appellee.\n\n\n[240 U.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Petition in the court of claims for the recovery of $8,595.35, alleged to be due claimant as a balance of the price of armor plate furnished the government under a contract between it and claimant.\n The contract is an elaborate one and by it claimant engaged to manufacture for the Ordnance Department armor plates of a certain designated thickness, in conformity with instructions, specifications, and drawings attached to and made a part of the contract. And claimant agreed to provide certain of the 18-inch plates for the purpose of the ballistic test prescribed by the specifications, and that such plates, when subjected to the ballistic test, should fulfil certain requirements set forth in the specifications. The dates of delivery were to be on or before September 7, 1911, and November 7, 1911, and the place of delivery the Bethlehem Steel Company, South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\n The government engaged to receive the plates when manufactured, tested, and approved as provided, and make payment for them in instalments from time to time as the manufacture of the armor and material progressed \n\n[240 U.S. 156, 161]\n\u00a0\n and after delivery. In the event of the claimant failing to prosecute the manufacture of the armor and material properly, or to complete delivery on or before the dates named in the contract, the Chief of Ordnance might complete such manufacture at the expense of claimant, charging it with the cost thereof in excess of the contract price; 'or else (2) waive the time limit named in the contract and permit the claimant to complete the delivery of the armor and material within a reasonable time, and thereupon deduct from the sum stipulated to be paid the claimant for all of the armor and material, as liquidated damages, a sum equal to 1\/30 of 1 per centum of the contract price of all armor and material remaining undelivered on November 7, 1911, for each day of delay in its delivery; Provided, however, that in computing the amount of any such deduction, the claimant should be given credit for delays occurring during the performance of the contract, which the Chief of Ordnance might determine to have been due 'to unavoidable causes, such as fires, storms, labor strikes, actions of the United States, and so forth,' and that the date of completion of the delivery, for the purposes of the final settlement between the parties, should be a date to be ascertained by deducting, from the whole period between the signing of the contract and the date of the actual delivery, all delays which were found to have been due to unavoidable causes.'\n It is alleged that claimant encountered difficulties which were unforeseen by both parties when the contract was made, and were then unforseeable, and in consequence thereof the delivery of the armor and pertaining material was delayed unavoidably.\n That prior to the manufacture of the armor no face-hardened armor 18 inches in thickness had been manufactured in this or any foreign country, and no information with respect to the process or processes to be employed in its manufacture was obtainable. \n\n[240 U.S. 156, 162]\n\u00a0\n That, for the purpose of learning what manner of treatment or face- hardening process should be applied to the 18-inch plates, and in order that they might attain the highest degree of efficiency possible, and meet all the requirements of the specifications, claimant completed one of the plates, applying to it a treatment or face-hardening process deduced from the formula which claimant and every other manufacturer of armor plate in this and every foreign country had followed in the manufacture of armor plate, and which was recognized by authorities on the subject as the one which would give the best results.\n That upon its completion the plate was, on April 19, 1911, subjected to the ballistic test and it met the requirements of the specifications. Thereupon claimant proceeded to complete all of the plates, certain of which were selected for the purpose of the ballistic test and failed to fulfil the requirements of the specifications. Other plates were selected and failed. Thereupon claimant, with all due diligence and despatch, made or caused to be made by metallurgical experts exhaustive tests and experiments, and it was ascertained that, in order to pass the test required by the Ordnance Department, the plates must possess certain metallurgical qualities or conditions which, up to that time, were unknown to anyone, and the necessity for which was not foreseeable when the contract was made. In conducting the test it was necessary to use plates of full size and the tests were conducted with all due diligence and despatch. From the plates thus tested the Ordnance Department selected a third plate which was tested January 19th and 24th, 1912, and was found to fulfil the requirements of the specifications. Claimant in due course finished all of the plates which the contract called for, and they were approved and delivered as in the manner prescribed.\n It is alleged that by reason of the circumstances detailed \n\n[240 U.S. 156, 163]\n\u00a0\n there were delays in the delivery of the plates, and that the delays were due to causes which were unavoidable within the meaning of the contract.\n On account of the delays, however, the Ordnance Department proposed to deduct from the contract price of the armor and pertaining material the sum of $8,598.15 as liquidated damages on account of a portion of the delay. Claimant made protest, asserting that the delays were due to causes provided for in articles 4 and 8 of the contract.\n By article 4 it was provided that in case of failure of claimant to deliver any or all of the armor contracted for there would be deducted from any payment to be made to claimant 1\/30 of 1 per cent of the contract price of all of the armor remaining undelivered for each and every day of delay in the completion of the contract, not, however, by way of penalty, but as liquidated damages.\n It was, however, provided in article 8 of the contract, that the Chief of Ordnance, in case of delay in the delivery of the armor, as provided in article 1 of the contract, instead of completing the manufacture or delivery of the material at the expense of claimant, might waive the time limit and deduct from any payment due or to become due the liquidated damages, if any, provided for in article 4: 'Provided, however, that in making final settlement based upon the date of completion of the delivery, the party of the first part [claimant] shall receive credit for such delays occurring during the performance of the contract as the Chief of Ordnance may determine to have been due to unavoidable causes, such as fires, storms, labor strikes, action of the United States, etc., and the date of completion shall be considered for the purposes of final settlement as the date of the actual completion of the delivery, less the delays due to unavoidable causes; but none of the above causes shall constitute a basis for an action against the United States for damages.' \n\n[240 U.S. 156, 164]\n\u00a0\n The government filed a demurrer to the petition. It was sustained as to $7,564.08 of the amount sued for and overruled as to $1,031.08. The damages on account of delay to the amount of the latter sum the court found was due to the government's delay. The other sum, that is $7,564.08, the court attributed to the claimant, the court saying, through Chief Justice Campbell, that 'the difficulties under which claimant labored . . . were not due to 'unavoidable causes' within the meaning of those terms in the contract, and, though unforeseen, did not render the performance impossible;' and added: 'The court cannot make a different contract from that which the parties made for themselves. The Harriman, 9 Wall. 161, 172, 19 L. ed. 629, 633; Sun Printing & Pub. Asso. v. Moore, \n183 U.S. 642\n, 46 L. ed. 366, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240; Satterlee's Case, 30 Ct. Cl. 31; Pacific Hardware & Steel Co. v. United States, 49 Ct. Cl. 327.' [49 Ct. Cl. 407].\n It will be observed that the point in the case is a short one. It is whether the causes of delay alleged in the petition were unavoidable, or were of the character described in the contract; that is, 'such as fires, storms, labor strikes, action of the United States, etc.' The contention that the alleged causes can be assigned to such category creates some surprise. It would seem that the very essence of the promise of a contract to deliver articles is ability to procure or make them. But claimant says its ignorance was not peculiar, that it was shared by the world, and no one knew that the process adequate to produce 14-inch armor plate would not produce 18-inch armor plate. Yet claimant shows that its own experiments demonstrated the inadequacy of the accepted formula. A successful process was therefore foreseeable and discoverable. And it would seem to have been an obvious prudence to have preceded manufacture, if not engagement, by experiment rather than risk failure and delay and their consequent penalties by extending an old formula to a new condition. \n\n[240 U.S. 156, 165]\n\u00a0\n But even if this cannot be asserted, the case falls within The Harriman, supra, where it is said that 'the principle deducible from the authorities is that if what is agreed to be done is possible and lawful, it must be done. Difficulty or improbability of accomplishing the undertaking will not avail the defendant. It must be shown that the thing cannot by any means be affected. Nothing short of this will excuse nonperformance.'\n And it was held in Sun Printing & Pub. Asso. v. Moore, \n183 U.S. 642\n, 46 L. ed. 366, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240, that 'it was a wellsettled rule of law that if a party by his contract charges himself with an obligation possible to be performed, he must make it good, unless its performance is rendered impossible by the act of God, the law, or the other party. Unforeseen difficulties, however great, will not excuse him.' Cases were cited, and it was said the principle was sustained by many adjudications.\n It was said, however, in The Harriman, that 'the answer to the objection of hardship in all such cases is that it might have been guarded against by a proper stipulation,' and such a stipulation is relied on in the case at bar. Ignorance of the scientific process necessary for face- hardening 18-inch armor plate is asserted to be an unavoidable cause of the character of the enumeration of article 8 of the contract; that is, such as fires, storms, labor strikes, action of the United States, etc.' The contention is that it is the same 'genus or kind,' because (1) it was not foreseeable when the contract was made; (2) was not the result of any act or neglect on the part of claimant; (3) was not a cause the company could prevent. What we have already said answers these contentions. Ability to perform a contract is of its very essence. It would have no sense or incentive, no assurance of fulfilment, otherwise; and a delay resulting from the absence of such ability is not of the same kind enumerated in the contract-is not a cause extraneous to it and \n\n[240 U.S. 156, 166]\n\u00a0\n independent of the engagements and exertions of the parties.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCAROLINA GLASS CO. v. STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA(1916)\nNo. 12\nArgued: January 20, 1916Decided: February 21, 1916\n\n\n Carolina \n240 U.S. 305\n (1916) ]\n\n\n[240 U.S. 305, 307]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William H. Lyles, David W. Robinson, and Jo-Berry S. Lyles for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Benjamin Lindsey Abney and Thomas H. Peeples for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n These suits grew out of the legislation by which South Carolina sought to control traffic in liquors. They involve closely related matters, were heard together, and it will be convenient likewise to dispose of them. In Scott v. Donald, \n165 U.S. 58\n, 41 L. ed. 632, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265, Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co. \n170 U.S. 438\n, 42 L. ed. 1100, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 674, and Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co. \n213 U.S. 151\n, 53 L. ed. 742, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 458, the history and general purposes of the legislation are considered.\n By act of 1892 the general assembly created a state board of control, with power to supervise the traffic; also provided for a state commissioner charged with the duty of purchasing and distributing liquors through local officers known as dispensers.\n The statute of 1896 directed election, by the general assembly, of the board of control, and gave it power to make purchases and to appoint a commissioner who should supply local dispensers selected by and under direction of county boards. By an amending act of 1900 the board then existing was abolished; a board of directors of the state dispensary was created, with power to prescribe rules and regulations to govern dispensaries, \n\n[240 U.S. 305, 308]\n\u00a0\n both state and county; and provision was made for the election of a dispensary commissioner. The new board was required to purchase liquor for lawful use within the state; and general management and control of the state dispensary was intrusted to the commissioner.\n A legislative committee was appointed in 1905 to investigate the state dispensary. In 1907 the statute of 1896 was repealed; control through a state board was abolished and county boards substituted, clothed with authority to purchase 'in the name of this state' all liquors to be sold within their several counties, 'Provided, That the state shall not be liable upon any contract for the purchase thereof beyond actual assets of the dispensary for which the purchase is made.' At the same time another act created a State Dispensary Commission of five, gave it control of all funds, assets, and property other than real estate of the state dispensary, required it to investigate all facts concerning outstanding claims against the state dispensary, and thereafter to pay all just liabilities from dispensary assets which might come into its hands. This second act of 1907 was amended in 1908, and the commission given 'full power to pass upon, fix and determine all claims against the state growing out of dealings with the dispensary; and to pay for the state any and all just claims, which have been submitted to and determined by it, and no other, out of the assets of the dispensary which have been or may hereafter be collected by said Dispensary Commission: Provided, That each and every person, firm or corporation, presenting a claim or claims to said Commission, shall have the right to appeal to the supreme court, as in cases at law.'\n By act of February 23d, 1910, findings of the State Dispensary Commission were declared to be final; any sum ascertained to be due the state was required to be deducted from whatever a county dispensary might own such debtor; and authority was given the Commission to \n\n[240 U.S. 305, 309]\n\u00a0\n command any county dispensary so indebted to turn over to it an equivalent amount of money. Notices of claims in favor of the state, creation of liens to secure the same, and enforcement of their payment, were also provided for.\n Number 12.\n The history and disposition of this cause in the state tribunals sufficiently appear from parts of the opinion by the supreme court (87 S. C. 270, 69 S. E. 391) quoted below:\n'The investigations of the committee [appointed 1905] resulted in an act, passed in 1907, authorizing the appointment of a commission, to be known as the State Dispensary Commission, whose duty it was to close out the entire business and property of the state dispensary, collect all debts due, and pay 'all just liabilities' of the state growing out of said business. The Commission was given 'full power and authority to investigate the past conduct of the affairs of the dispensary.' It was also clothed with all the power and authority conferred upon the committee which had been appointed under the resolution above referred to. 25 Stat. 835. The act of 1907 was amended in 1908 so as to give the Commission 'full power to pass upon, fix and determine all claims against the state growing out of dealings with the dispensary; and to pay for the state any and all just claims which have been submitted to and determined by it, and no other.' 25 Stat. 1289\n\n\n\n'Appellant presented to the Commission a claim for $23,013.75 as the balance due it by the state for bottles and demijohns furnished to the dispensary under contracts made with the board of directors from and including April, 1906, until the business was closed out by the Commission. Appellant had also furnished the dispensary practically all the bottles and demijohns used since about December, 1902; but all accounts prior to April, 1906, had been settled. \n\n[240 U.S. 305, 310]\n\u00a0\n 'Upon the filing of this claim, the Commission went into an investigation of all past dealings of appellant with the dispensary; and, after hearing a great deal of testimony and argument thereon, rendered its decision, dated Nov. 17, 1909, which will be set out in the report of the case.\n\n'The conclusion and finding of the Commission was that, in pursuance of a conspiracy between some of the directors of the dispensary and some of the appellant's officers or agents to defraud the state, whereby legitimate competition was destroyed, appellant had a monopoly of the business of furnishing glass to the dispensary from the date of its beginning business, in 1902, until April, 1906; and that the prices paid it for glass during that period exceeded the fair market value thereof by $ 51,432.99. Therefore, allowing appellant's claim of $23,013.75, the Commission found that appellant was indebted to the state in the sum of $ 28,419.24, the difference between the amount of its claim and the sum it had fraudulently collected from the state.\n\n'From that decision, this appeal was taken, under the provisions of the statute, giving every claimant the right of appeal to the supreme court, 'as in cases at law.' Appellant concedes that the jurisdiction of this court is limited in such cases to a review of alleged errors of law.\n\n ... * *\n'The next contention of appellant is that the Commission is not a court, but a special tribunal of limited power, and that it exceeded its authority in undertaking to fix and determine appellant's liability to the state, and then set off its claim against the liability so fixed. It is conceded that the Commission is not a court, though its duties necessarily involve, to some extent, the exercise of judicial functions, as is always the case where judgment and discretion are to be exercised. It was created under  2 of article 17 of the Constitution, which provides \n\n[240 U.S. 305, 311]\n\u00a0\n that 'the general assembly may direct by law in what manner claims against the state may be established and adjusted.'\n\n ... * *\n'The question, therefore, whether the commission had authority to entertain a 'set-off' or 'counterclaim' in favor of the state against a claimant, in the technical sense in which those terms are used in legal proceedings, is not germane or material to the present inquiry. To what purpose should the Commission investigate, unless it announced the result of its investigation? We see no error, therefore, in the Commission stating its findings as the result of its investigation.\n\n'The findings of the Commission, however, are controlling only in its determination of the nonliability of the state upon appellant's claim. They have not the force or effect of a judgment, concluding appellant in any other proceeding,-such, for instance, as the state might institute in the proper court to recover the amount found by the Commission to be due it by appellant.\n\n ... * *\n'The judgment of this court is that the decision of the Commission upon plaintiff's claim against the state be affirmed.'\n\n Manifestly, we think, the supreme court affirmed the Commission's action only in so far as it declined to approve the glass company's claim,- there was no final determination of the state's right to recover over against the company.\n Error is assigned concerning supposed Federal questions upon the theory that there has been 'in practical effect an adjudication of the validity of the alleged claim of the state arising out of the ended transactions prior to April, 1906, and a satisfaction of such a judgment by the confiscation of plaintiff in error's property; that is, its claim against the state for goods furnished since 1906.' \n\n[240 U.S. 305, 312]\n\u00a0\n This theory is entirely out of harmony with the supreme court's opinion, which holds the validity of possible demands against the glass company remains wholly undetermined, and that, acting within its plain powers, the state had only refused to recognize and discharge a claim against itself. The argument of counsel proceeds upon a fundamental misconception. We find no error in the judgment below, and it must be affirmed.\n Number 9.\n By this original proceeding begun in the supreme court of South Carolina, March 4, 1910, the Carolina Glass Company sought to restrain any effort to collect the so-called overjudgment for $28,419.24, pronounced by the Dispensary Commission under circumstances narrated supra (cause No. 12 ); and also to prevent the Commission from demanding or receiving sums of money alleged to be due the company from certain county dispensaries, or interfering with payment of such indebtedness.\n Quotations from the opinion below (87 S. C. 270, 285) will adequately disclose the issues involved.\n'These arise principally out of an act approved February 23, 1910, and what was done by the defendants under the provisions of that act, which, it will be noted, was passed subsequent to the decision of the Commission upon the claim of the plaintiff. The provisions of the first five sections of the act pertinent to this case are, in substance: That, in addition to the powers conferred by all previous acts, the Dispensary Commission shall have power to pass upon, fix and determine claims of the state against any person, firm, or corporation heretofore doing business with the state dispensary, and settle and receipt therefor; that the findings of the Commission under its provisions shall be final, and, upon the finding by the Commission that any person, firm, or corporation is indebted to the state, the dispensary auditor and officials \n\n[240 U.S. 305, 313]\n\u00a0\n having charge of the funds of any county dispensary whcih may be indebted to such person, firm, or corporation, shall pay to the Commission the amount so found to be due the state, or so much thereof as the funds in their hands due to such person, firm, or corporation will pay, and the receipt of the Commission shall be a sufficient voucher therefor; that the Commission may, by its order, stop the paying out of any funds of any county dispensary by any officer having charge thereof. Sections 7 and 9 of the act are as follows: [They are copied in margin.]\n\n Sec. 7. 'The State Dispensary Commission is hereby empowered to pass all orders and judgments and do any and all things necessary to carry out the purposes of this act; and all judgments rendered by them for any claim due the state shall be a lien on the property of the judgment debtor situated within this state, and a transcript of said judgment shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the court of common pleas in each county where any property of such judgment debtor is situated.'\n Sec. 9. 'In all cases pending before the said State Dispensary Commission, upon any claim or claims against any person or persons or any corporation or corporations owning any real estate in any county in this state, the said Commission shall file in the office of the clerk of court in each county where such real estate is situated a notice of the pendency of such cases, and the said notice so filed shall be full notice to all persons whomsoever claiming any title to or lien upon such real estate acquired subsequent to the filing thereof, and the debt found by said Commission to be due the state shall have priority over the claims of all creditors, except creditors secured by mortgage or judgment entered and recorded prior to the filing of such notice, and the said real estate, in the hands of any person or persons whomsoever, shall be liable for the payment of such debt so found to be due the state.'\n'Within a few days after the approval of the act, to wit, on February 26, 1910, the Commission, by its attorneys, filed in the office of the clerk of the court for Richland county, in which county plaintiff owned real estate, a notice, headed or entitled, The State v. Carolina Glass Co., and signed by the attorney general and other counsel \n\n[240 U.S. 305, 314]\n\u00a0\n representing the state. The notice was as follows: 'Notice is hereby given to all whom it may concern, that the above stated cause has been instituted, and is now pending before the State Dispensary Commission for the recovery against the Carolina Glass Company of $29,000, the amount which has been found to be due from the said defendant to the state of South Carolina owing to overcharges made by said defendant in selling goods to the state dispensary, and this notice is given in accordance with the terms of an act of the legislature passed in February, 1910, and duly approved by the governor.' About the same time, notice was served on the plaintiff, pursuant to the provisions of the act, that the Commission would proceed to pass upon, fix, and determine the claim of the state against the plaintiff on account of the overcharges growing out of its dealings with the dispensary. Notice was also served on the county dispensary board of Richland county, requiring that board to pay to the Commission the amount due by said board to the plaintiff.\n\n'Another feature of the case grows out of an agreement alleged to have been made between the attorneys for the plaintiff and the attorney representing the state with regard to payments for shipments of glass made by plaintiff to the county dispensaries after November 20, 1909.\n\n ... * *\n'Under the provisions of the Constitution (art. 8,  11) and statutes ( 25 Stat. 463) the county dispensaries are conducted 'under the authority and in the name of the state.' Therefore, the officers in charge of them are agents of the state and the funds arising from the sale of liquors through them are the funds of the state, and the debts due for goods sold to them are the debts of the state. In exercising the powers conferred upon it by the legislature, the Dispensary Commission is also the agent and representative of the state, 'subject to no interference, \n\n[240 U.S. 305, 315]\n\u00a0\n except that of the general assembly itself,' and a suit brought against it is, in effect, a suit against the state. State ex rel. Lyon v. State Dispensary Commission, 79 S. C. 316, 329, 60 S. E. 928. As the state cannot be sued without its consent, no court has power to interfere with or direct the disposition of the state's funds in the hands of its agents, unless it appears that they are acting without authority of law, or are refusing to recognize and obey the law to the detriment of private rights . . . . In ordering the funds in the hands of the officers of the county dispensaries due to the plaintiff turned over to itself, the commission acted within the limits of its authority and discretion conferred upon it by the legislature, and this court has no power to interfere. From the foregoing, it will be seen that it is unnecessary to inquire or decide whether there was an agreement between the attorneys for plaintiff and the attorneys for the state as to the collection of the amounts due plaintiff from the county dispensaries for shipments made prior to November 20th, or what the agreement was, or whether it has been violated. The Dispensary Commission is the sole arbiter of the rights of the plaintiff, if it has any, with regard to that matter.\n\n ... * *\n'So long, therefore, as the action of the Commission was confined to the investigation of all dealings, past and present, with the dispensary, and the determination of the just liabilities of the state growing out of them, it was, as we have seen, based upon constitutional authority, and was valid and binding. But we find no authority in the Constitution for the legislature to provide by law how claims of the state against others shall be established or adjusted, except through the courts. We conclude, therefore, that in so far as the act of 1910 attempts to confer upon the Commission power to pass final judgment upon the claim of the state against the plaintiff, it is unconstitutional, \n\n[240 U.S. 305, 316]\n\u00a0\n null, and void. And, as the lien which the act attempts to create is based upon the unauthorized act of the Commission, it is likewise null and void.'\n\n Defendants were accordingly enjoined from asserting a lien upon the company's property, and the notice filed in Richland county was directed to be canceled; but the Commission's power to remove funds from county dispensaries was upheld.\n Plaintiff in error now maintains the socalled overjudgment of November 17, 1909, was void; that by reason of claims against them it had contract and property rights in money held by the county dispensaries; and that removal of funds therefrom by the State Dispensary Commission impaired contract obligations in violation of  10, article 1, Federal Constitution, and deprived it of property without due process of law.\n It was distinctly adjudged by the supreme court that the Dispensary Commission was without power to pronounce the overjudgment; that it was invalid and could not be enforced. In view of repeated holdings by that court and our opinion in Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co. \n213 U.S. 151\n, 53 L. ed. 742, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 458, it is clear that funds of county dispensaries were state funds, and, as such, subject to control by the Dispensary Commission. Their removal, therefore, violated no right which the glass company could assert,-the state had not consented to be sued. The judgment of the court below must be affirmed.\n Number 205.\n The Carolina Glass Company instituted this proceeding at law in the United States district court, South Carolina, December 13, 1911, to recover judgment against individual members of the Dispensary Commission for sums of money said to have been unlawfully withdrawn by them from county dispensaries which held the same for plaintiff's benefit. It is alleged that for supplies furnished partly before \n\n[240 U.S. 305, 317]\n\u00a0\n and partly after February 23, 1910, these county dispensaries became lawfully indebted to the company for more than $19,000, and that the money in their keeping was held in trust to pay such sum, and further:\n'That the said defendants, undertaking to proceed under  6 of the act entitled, 'An Act to Further Provide for Winding up the Affairs of the State Dispensary,' approved the 23d day of February, 1910 [copied in margin], as this plaintiff is informed and believes, demanded from the county dispensary boards for the county of Clarendon, the county of Richmond, and the county of Georgetown, the sums of money alleged in paragraph six of this complaint, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of nineteen thousand and eighty-four and 38\/100 dollars then due to this plaintiff by said several county dispensary boards, as alleged in said paragraph six, and unlawfully and wrongfully received the said sums of money from said several county dispensary boards, claiming that they were entitled to the same on account of the above-mentioned illegal offset found by said State Dispensary Commission to be due by this plaintiff as aforesaid; which action this plaintiff alleges was wholly without authority of law, as the provisions of said  6 of the act of February 23d, 1910, were unconstitutional, null, and void, as constituting an effort, unwarrantably and without authority, to confiscate the property of this plaintiff without due process of law, the provisions of said section being \n\n[240 U.S. 305, 318]\n\u00a0\n in violation of  10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States, and also of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and, furthermore, in violation of the express contract and agreement entered into by this plaintiff with the defendants above named as above alleged.'\n\n Holding it in effect a suit against the state, the district court dismissed the cause (197 Fed. 392); and it is here upon direct writ of error. We are of opinion that the action of the court below was correct. And in view of what has been said above and our opinion in Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co. further discussion of the questions involved would not be profitable. The judgment is affirmed.\n Number 204.\n This writ brings up a judgment rendered by the circuit court of appeals, fourth circuit, affirming the same final judgment of the district court considered in No. 205, supra. 124 C. C. A. 423, 206 Fed. 635. There is no allegation of diverse citizenship, and the trial court's jurisdiction was invoked solely upon the ground that the controversy involved application of the Federal Constitution.\n Sec. 6. 'In any and all cases where the State Dispensary Commission has heretofore found any amount due the state by any person, firm or corporation on account of dealings with the state dispensary, the several county dispensary boards now existing, and all boards and other officer or officers in charge of any money due any such person, firm or corporation on account of any dealings with any and all county dispensaries heretofore existing, shall, upon demand, pay to the State Dispensary Commission a sufficient amount, or so much thereof as may be on hand, to cover the amount so found to be due the state.'\n In such circumstances the Circuit Court of Appeals is without jurisdiction to review.

U S(1916)\nNo. 197\nArgued: January 26, 1916Decided: March 6, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 399, 400]\n\u00a0\n Mr. T. Marshall Miller for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Knaebel and Mr. S. W. Williams for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit by the United States to recover the title to 157.77 acres of land in Ascension parish, Louisiana, patented to Powhatan E. Causey and by him transferred to James L. Bradford. While the land was yet public, Causey secured a preliminary homestead entry thereof by taking an oath, as was required, that he had not directly or indirectly made, and would not make, any agreement whereby the title which he might acquire would inure in whole or in part to the benefit of another. After the expiration of fourteen months he secured a final entry under the commutation provision of the homestead law by presenting proof that he had not sold or contracted to sell any part of the land, and by paying therefor in so-called scrip at the rate of $1.25 per acre. Pursuant to the final entry the land was patented to him, and he transferred it to Bradford. As grounds for the suit the bill charges that the oath and proof whereby the entries were secured were false in that, when Causey applied for the preliminary entry, he had entered into an agreement with one Wright, a clerk and agent of Bradford, whereby the title when acquired was to be passed to the latter; that both entries were made in pursuance of this unlawful agreement and were therefore fraudulent; and that Bradford took the transfer from Causey under the agreement and with full knowledge of the fraud perpetrated upon the government. It also is alleged that, in virtue of an arrangement with Bradford, Causey is claiming an interest in half of the land. With Bradford's \n\n[240 U.S. 399, 401]\n\u00a0\n CONSENT A DECREE WAS ENTERED AGAINST HIM. causey answered, denying the unlawful agreement and fraud, and the suit was referred to a master, who found the facts to be as charged in the bill. The findings were sustained by the district court, which entered a decree against Causey, and the decree was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 121 C. C. A. 663, 203 Fed. 1022\n\n\n Complaint is made of the findings. They were concurred in by the master and both courts, and therefore should be permitted to stand unless shown to be plainly erroneous. Washington Securities Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 76, 78\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1220, 1222, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 725; Gilson v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 380, 383\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1361, 1362, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 778. Testing them by the evidence, we discover no plain error, but, on the contrary, that they are amply sustained.\n That the title was acquired by substituting the minimum price of the land for a part of the required five years of residence and cultivation, as permitted by the commutation provision of the homestead law, is not material, for the agreement to obtain the land for the benefit of another disqualified Causey from acquiring the title in either mode. Bailey v. Sanders, \n228 \nU.S. 603, 608\n, 57 S. L. ed. 985, 988, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 602; Gilson v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 380, 384\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1361, 1363, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 778.\n The bill, while purporting to be brought in the name and for the benefit of the United States, and bearing the signature of the assistant United States attorney for the district, does not state or show that it is brought with the sanction of the Attorney General, and because of this it is objected, as it was in both courts below, that the bill should not be entertained, but dismissed. In the absence of a controlling statute, and there is none, it is essential to such a suit that it be brought with the Attorney General's approval; and while the usual and better practice is to state or show in the bill that it is brought with his approval, this is not indispensable. The case is argued here on behalf of the government by one of the Assistant Attorneys General, who files a certified copy of a letter \n\n[240 U.S. 399, 402]\n\u00a0\n from the Attorney General, authorizing the institution of the suit conformably to a request of the Secretary of the Interior. This sufficiently meets the objection, especially as it is fairly inferable that the letter was exhibited in the courts below. United States v. Throckmorton, \n98 \nU.S. 61, 70\n, 25 S.

Rep. 850.\n The further objection is made that the bill cannot be maintained because it does not contain an offer to return the scrip received when the commuted entry was made. The objection assumes that the suit is upon the same plane as if brought by an individual vendor to annul a sale of land fraudulently induced. But, as this court has said, the government, in disposing of its public lands, does not assume the attitude of a mere seller of real estate at its market value. These lands are held in trust for all the people, and in providing for their disposal Congress has sought to advance the interests of the whole country by opening them to entry in comparatively small tracts under restrictions designed to accomplish their settlement, development, and utilization. And when a suit is brought to annul a patent obtained in violation of these restrictions, the purpose is not merely to regain the title, but also to enforce a public statute and maintain the policy underlying it. Such a suit is not within the reason of the ordinary rule that a vendor suing to annul a sale fraudulently induced must offer and be ready to return the consideration received. That rule, if applied, would tend to frustrate the policy of the public land laws; and so it is held that the wrongdoer must restore the title unlawfully obtained and abide the judgment of Congress as to whether the consideration paid shall be refunded.

CHICAGO AUDITORIUM ASS'N(1916)\nNo. 162\nArgued: January 12, 1916Decided: April 3, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 581, 582]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edwin C. Brandenburg, Frederick D. Silber, and Clarence J. Silber for the Central Trust Company of Illinois.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 581, 584]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William D. Bangs, Rudolph Matz, and John C. Mechem for the Chicago Auditorium Association. \n\n[240 U.S. 581, 585]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n On July 22, 1911, a creditors' petition in bankruptcy was filed against the Frank E. Scott Transfer Company, an Illinois corporation, and it was adjudged a bankrupt on August 7. The act of bankruptcy charged and adjudicated does not appear. When the proceedings were commenced, the bankrupt held contract relations with the Chicago Auditorium Association under a written agreement made between them February 1, 1911, which had been partially \n\n[240 U.S. 581, 586]\n\u00a0\n performed. By its terms the Association granted to the Transfer Company, for a term of five years from the date of the contract, the baggage and livery privilege of the Auditorium Hotel, in the city of Chicago; that is to say, the sole and exclusive right, so far as it was within the legal capacity of the Association to grant the same, to transfer baggage and carry passengers to and from the hotel and to furnish livery to its guests and patrons. For the baggage privilege the Transfer Company agreed to pay to the Association the sum of $6,000, in monthly instalments of $100 each, and for the livery privilege the sum of $15,000, in monthly instalments of $ 250 each, and also agreed to furnish to the hotel and its guests and patrons prompt and efficient baggage and livery service at reasonable rates at all times during the continuance of the privileges. It was further agreed as follows:\n'The party of the first part [Chicago Auditorium Association], however, reserves the right, which is an express condition of the foregoing grants, to cancel and revoke either or both of said privileges, by giving six months' notice in writing of its election so to do, whenever the service is not, in the opinion of the party of the first part, satisfactory, or in the event of any change in management of said hotel; and in case of the termination of either or both of said privileges by exercise of the right and option reserved by this paragraph, such privilege or privileges shall cease and determine at the expiration of the six months' notice aforesaid, and both parties hereto shall in that case be released from further liability respecting the concession so canceled and revoked.\n\n'Said rights and concessions shall not be assignable without the express written consent of the party of the first part, nor shall the assignment of the same, with such written consent, relieve the party of the second part [Scott Transfer Company] from liability on the covenants and agreements of this instrument.' \n\n[240 U.S. 581, 587]\n\u00a0\n The contract authorized the Association, in the event of default by the Transfer Company in the payment of any instalment of money due, or in the performance of any other covenant, if continued for thirty days, to terminate the privileges at its option, without releasing the Transfer Company from liability upon its covenants. Should either or both of the privileges be thus terminated before January 31, 1916, the Association was to be at liberty to sell the privileges, or make a new or different contract for the remainder of the term, but was not to be obliged to do this, and the Transfer Company, unless released in writing, was to remain liable for the entire amount agreed to be paid by it.\n\n Up to the time of the bankruptcy this contract remained in force, and neither party had violated any of its covenants. The trustee in bankruptcy did not elect to assume its performance, and the Association entered into a contract with other parties for the performance of the baggage and livery service, and obtained therefrom the sum of $234.69 monthly as compensation for those privileges. On February 28, 1912, it exhibited its proof against the bankrupt estate, claiming an indebtedness of $6,537.94, of which $311.20 had accrued prior to the bankruptcy proceedings, and the remainder was claimed as unliquidated damages arising under the contract for alleged breach thereof on the part of the bankrupt through the bankruptcy proceedings. Of this amount $691.86 represented the loss incurred during the first six months of bankruptcy. Objections filed by the trustee were sustained by the referee, except as to that portion of the claim which had accrued prior to the bankruptcy proceedings. On review, the district court sustained this decision. On appeal to the circuit court of appeals, the order of the district court was reversed, and the cause remanded with direction to allow $691.86 upon the claim, and to disallow the remaining portion. 132 C. C. A. 452, 216 Fed. 308. \n\n[240 U.S. 581, 588]\n\u00a0\n An appeal to this court by the trustee in bankruptcy was allowed, under  25b-2 of the bankruptcy act (of July 1, 1898, chap. 541, 30 Stat. at L. 544, 553, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9585, 9609), upon a certificate by a justice of this court that the determination of the questions involved was essential to a uniform construction of the act throughout the United States. This is No. 162. Thereafter a cross appeal by the Auditorium Association was allowed by one of the judges of the circuit court of appeals. This is No. 174.\n A motion is made to dismiss the cross appeal, and this must be granted. In the absence of the certificate prescribed by  25b-2, the sole authority for an appeal from a decision of the circuit court of appeals, allowing or rejecting a claim, is found in  25b-1: 'Where the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of two thousand dollars, and the question involved is one which might have been taken on appeal or writ of error from the highest court of a state to the Supreme Court of the United States.' This limits such appeals to cases where Federal questions are involved, of the kind described in  237, Judicial Code (36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1214). The motion to dismiss is resisted upon the ground that the claim of the Association to damages beyond a period of six months was denied by the court of appeals as not constituting a provable debt in bankruptcy, and that a Federal question is thus necessarily presented, provability depending upon a construction of the bankruptcy act. An examination of the opinion of that court, however, shows that while it held that damages for anticipatory breach of the contract were provable, it held that the contract itself, because of the option reserved to the Auditorium Association to cancel it on six months' notice, was mutually obligatory for that term only, and hence no damages beyond that period were allowable. This involved no Federal question. Chapman v. Bowen, \n207 \nU.S. 89, 92\n, 52 S. L. ed. 116, 117, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 32.\n But, in view of the general importance of the question of the amount allowable in its relation to the questions \n\n[240 U.S. 581, 589]\n\u00a0\n involved in the trustee's appeal, we have concluded that a certiorari should be allowed in lieu of the cross appeal.\n Coming to the merits: It is no longer open to question in this court that, as a rule, where a party bound by an executory contract repudiates his obligations or disables himself from performing them before the time for performance, the promisee has the option to treat the contract as ended, so far as further performance is concerned, and maintain an action at once for the damages occasioned by such anticipatory breach. The rule has its exceptions, but none that now concerns us. Roehm v. Horst, \n178 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 19 S., 44 L. ed. 953, 960, 961, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 780. And see O'Neill v. Supreme Council, A. L. H. 70 N. J. L. 410, 412, 57 Atl. 463, 1 Ann. Cas. 422. There is no doubt that the same rule must be applied where a similar repudiation or disablement occurs during performance. Whether the intervention of bankruptcy constitutes such a breach and gives rise to a claim provable in the bankruptcy proceedings is a question not covered by any previous decision of this court, and upon which the other Federal courts are in conflict. It was, however, held in Lovell v. St. Louis Mut. L. Ins. Co. \n111 \nU.S. 264, 274\n, 28 S. L. ed. 423, 426, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 390, where a life insurance company became insolvent and transferred its assets to another company, that a policy holder was entitled to regard his contract as terminated and demand whatever damages he had sustained thereby. And see Carr v. Hamilton, \n129 \nU.S. 252, 256\n, 32 S. L. ed. 669, 670, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 295. In support of the provability of the claim in controversy, Ex parte Pollard, 2 Low. Dec. 411, Fed. Cas.

C. A. 571, 119 Fed. 139; Watson v. Merrill, 69 L.R.A. 719, 69 C. C. A. 185, 136 Fed. 359; Re Roth, 31 L.R.A. (N.S.) 270, 104 C. C. A. 649, 181 Fed. 667; Colman Co. v. Withoft, 115 C. C. A. 222, 195 Fed. 250. Cases of the latter class are distinguishable because of the 'diversity betweene duties which touch the realty, and the meere personalty.' Co. Litt. 292, b,  513.\n The contract with which we have to deal was not a contract of personal service simply, but was of such a nature as evidently to require a considerable amount of capital, in the shape of equipment, etc., for its proper performance by the Transfer Company. The immediate effect of bankruptcy was to strip the company of its assets, and thus disable it from performing. It may be conceded that the contract was assignable, and passed to the trustee under  70a (30 Stat. at L. 565, chap. 541, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9654), to the extent that it had an option to perform it in the place of the bankrupt (see Sparhawk v. Yerkes, \n142 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 35 S. L. ed. 915, 918, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 104; Sunflower Oil Co. v. Wilson, \n142 \nU.S. 313, 322\n, 35 S. L. ed. 1025, 1028, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 235); for although there was a stipulation against assignment without consent of the Auditorium Association, it may be assumed that this did not prevent an assignment by operation of law. Still, the trustee in bankruptcy did not elect to assume performance, and so the matter is left as if the law had conferred no such election.\n It is argued that there can be no anticipatory breach of a contract except it result from the voluntary act of one of the parties, and that the filing of an involuntary petition in bankruptcy, with adjudication thereon, is but the act of the law resulting from an adverse proceeding instituted by creditors. This view was taken, with respect to the effect of a state proceeding restraining a corporation from the further prosecution of its business or the exercise of its corporate franchises, appointing a receiver, and \n\n[240 U.S. 581, 591]\n\u00a0\n dissolving the corporation, in People v. Globe Mut. L. Ins. Co. 91 N. Y. 174, cited with approval in some of the Federal court decisions above referred to. In that case, it did not appear that the company was the responsible cause of the action of the state, so as to make the dissolution its own act; but, irrespective of this, we cannot accept the reasoning. As was said in Roehm v. Horst, \n178 U.S. 19\n, 44 L. ed. 960, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 780: 'The parties to a contract which is wholly executory have a right to the maintenance of the contractual relations up to the time for performance, as well as to a performance of the contract when due.' Commercial credits are, to a large extent, based upon the reasonable expectation that pending contracts of acknowledged validity will be performed in due course; and the same principle that entitles the promisee to continued willingness entitles him to continued ability on the part of the promisor. In short, it must be deemed an implied term of every contract that the promisor will not permit himself, through insolvency or acts of bankruptcy, to be disabled from making performance; and, in this view, bankruptcy proceedings are but the natural and legal consequence of something done or omitted to be done by the bankrupt, in violation of his engagement. It is the purpose of the bankruptcy act, generally speaking, to permit all creditors to share in the distribution of the assets of the bankrupt, and to leave the honest debtor thereafter free from liability upon previous obligations. Williams v. United States Fidelity & G. Co. \n236 \nU.S. 549, 554\n, 59 S. L. ed. 713, 716, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289. Executory agreements play so important a part in the commercial world that it would lead to most unfortunate results if, by interpreting the act in a narrow sense, persons entitled to performance of such agreements on the part of bankrupts were excluded from participation in bankrupt estates, while the bankrupts themselves, as a necessary corollary, were left still subject to action for nonperformance in the future, although without the property or credit often necessary to enable them to perform. \n\n[240 U.S. 581, 592]\n\u00a0\n We conclude that proceedings, whether voluntary or involuntary, resulting in an adjudication of bankruptcy, are the equivalent of an anticipatory breach of an executory agreement within the doctrine of Roehm v. Horst, supra.\n The claim for damages by reason of such a breach is 'founded upon a contract, express or implied,' within the meaning of  63a-4, and the damages may be liquidated under  63b. Frederic L. Grant Shoe Co. v. W. M. Laird Co. \n212 \nU.S. 445, 448\n, 53 S. L. ed. 591, 593, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 332. It is true that in Zavelo v. Reeves, \n227 \nU.S. 625, 631\n, 57 S. L. ed. 676, 678, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 365, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 664, we held that the debts provable under  63a-4 include only such as existed at the time of the filing of the petition. But we agree with what was said in Ex parte Pollard, 2 Low. Dec. 411, Fed. Cas. No. 11,252, that it would be 'an unnecessary and false nicety' to hold that because it was the act of filing the petition that wrought the breach, therefore there was no breach at the time of the petition. As was declared in Re. Pettingill, 137 Fed. 143, 147; 'The test of provability under the act of 1898 may be stated thus: If the bankrupt, at the time of bankruptcy by disenabling himself from performing the contract in question, and by repudiating its obligation, could give the proving creditor the right to maintain at once a suit in which damages could be assessed at law or in equity, then the creditor can prove in bankruptcy on the ground that bankruptcy is the equivalent of disenablement and repudiation. For the assessment of damages proceedings may be directed by the court under  63b (30 Stat. at L. 563, chap. 541, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9647).' It was in effect so ruled by this court in Lesser v. Gray, \n236 \nU.S. 70, 75\n, 59 S. L. ed. 471, 475, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 227, where it was said: 'If, as both the bankruptcy and state courts concluded, the contract was terminated by the involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, no legal injury resulted. If, on the other hand, that view of the law was erroneous, then there was a breach and defendant Gray became liable for any resulting damage; but he was released therefrom by his \n\n[240 U.S. 581, 593]\n\u00a0\n discharge.' Of course, he could not be released unless the debt was provable.\n We therefore conclude that the circuit court of appeals was correct in holding that the intervention of bankruptcy constituted such a breach of the contract in question as entitled the Auditorium Association to prove its claim.\n The denial of all damages except such as accrued within six months after the filing of the petition was based upon the ground that the contract reserved to the Association an option to revoke the privileges by giving six months' notice in writing of its election so to do, in which case both parties were to be released from further liability at the expiration of the six months. It was held that because of this the contract was mutually obligatory for that term only, and uncertain and without force for any longer term of service in futuro, within the ruling of this court in Dunbar v. Dunbar, \n190 U.S. 340\n, 47 L. ed. 1084, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 757. In that case the contract was to pay to a divorced wife 'during her life, or until she marries, for her maintenance and support, yearly, the sum of $500;' and it was held that for instalments falling due after bankruptcy the husband remained liable, notwithstanding his discharge, on the ground that the wife's claim for such payments was not provable because of the impossibility of calculating the continuance of widowhood so as to base a valuation upon it. The court referred to the 1903 amendment of  17 of the bankruptcy act (32 Stat. at L. 797, chap. 487, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9601), relating to debts not affected by a discharge, and including among these a liability for alimony due or to become due for maintenance or support of wife or child. This, while enacted after the Dunbar suit was begun, and not applicable to it, was cited as showing the legislative trend in the direction of not discharging an obligation of the bankrupt for the support of his wife or children. The authority of that decision cannot be extended to cover \n\n[240 U.S. 581, 594]\n\u00a0\n such a case as the present. Here the obligation of the bankrupt was clear and unconditional. The right reserved to the Auditorium Association to cancel and revoke the privileges was reserved for its benefit, not that of the grantee of those privileges. It does not lie in the mouth of the latter, or of its trustee, to say that its service would not be satisfactory, and there is no presumption that otherwise it would have been advantageous to the Association to exercise the option. It results that the decree, in so far as it limits the provable claim to a period of six months after the bankruptcy, must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n No. 162.

Allan D. Cole and H. W. Cole for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n In this action, which was brought in a state court under the Federal employers' liability act of April 22, 1908 (chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657), the following facts appeared or might reasonably be inferred from the evidence most favorable to defendant in error (plaintiff below), in the light of which the initial question touching the validity of the judgment in his favor must be determined:\n On January 22, 1911, plaintiff was in the employ of defendant and acting as head brakeman on train No. 95-a fast west-bound interstate freight train. When the \n\n[241 U.S. 310, 312]\n\u00a0\n train reached a station called Springdale, about 6 miles east of Maysville, in Kentucky, the train engineer directed plaintiff to go to a nearby railway telephone, call up the operator, and ascertain the whereabouts of train No. 1, which was a fast west-bound passenger train; the object being to determine whether it was safe for No. 95 to proceed to Maysville ahead of it. Plaintiff was unable to understand the operator and so reported to the engineer. He then got into the cab of the locomotive and the train proceeded to the coal docks, about 1 mile east of Maysville and about 460 yards east of a telegraph station in a signal tower known as the F. G. cabin, where it stopped for coal and water. Plaintiff was directed by the engineer to go forward to F. G. cabin and ascertain from the operator the whereabouts of train No. 1. Plaintiff went to the tower, and was there advised that his train had time to reach Maysville. He immediately descended to the platform in front of the tower and beside the track, and saw that his train was approaching. He waited for it, and when it reached the platform he attempted to board the engine. He could not accurately judge the speed of the train, but it appeared to him to be going slowly enough for him to get aboard it. He caught hold of the grab iron and put one foot on the step, and then the speed of the train, combined with his weight, caused his foot to slip and loosened his hold, so that he fell beneath the wheels of the tender and his arm was cut off. He had been employed as brakeman for about six weeks, and before that had made two round trips over the road for the purpose of becoming acquainted with his duties. During the time of his employment he had frequently been called upon, under orders of the train engineer, to leave the train and go forward to signal towers for orders or information, and then mount the train as it came moving by. On the occasion of the accident the train was running about 12 miles per hour. \n\n[241 U.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n The case went to the jury under instructions making defendant's liability dependent upon whether the engineer, with knowledge of plaintiff's presence at the telegraph tower upon business connected with the operation of the train, and with knowledge of his purpose to board the train, negligently operated the train at such a rate of speed as to make plaintiff's attempt to board it unusually hazardous. There was a verdict for plaintiff and the resulting judgment was affirmed by the court of appeals of Kentucky. 159 Ky. 687, 167 S. W. 933.\n Upon the present writ of error, it is not disputed that there was sufficient evidence of the negligence of the engineer to require the submission of the case to the jury. It is argued that there was no substantial evidence to support the conclusion that such negligence was the proximate cause of the injury; but this is so clearly untenable as to require no discussion. The remaining questions turn upon the application of the law respecting assumption of risk.\n It is insisted that, even conceding the train was operated at a negligent rate of speed in view of plaintiff's purpose to board it, yet he assumed the risk of injury involved in the attempt. The act of Congress, by making the carrier liable for an employee's injury 'resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees' of the carrier, abrogated the common-law rule known as the fellow-servant doctrine by placing the negligence of a coemployee upon the same basis as the negligence of the employer. At the same time, in saving the defense of assumption of risk in cases other than those where the violation by the carrier of a statute enacted for the safety of employees may contribute to the injury or death of an employee (Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 502\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1062, 1069, L.R.A.1915C, 1, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475, 8 N. C. C. A. 834), the act placed a coemployee's negligence, where it is the ground of the action, in the same relation as the employer's own negligence would stand \n\n[241 U.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n to the question whether a plaintiff is to be deemed to have assumed the risk.\n On the facts of the case before us, therefore, plaintiff having voluntarily entered into an employment that required him on proper occasion to board a moving train, he assumed the risk of injury normally incident to that operation, other than such as might arise from the failure of the locomotive engineer to operate the train with due care to maintain a moderate rate of speed in order to enable plaintiff to board it without undue peril to himself. But plaintiff had the right to presume that the engineer would exercise reasonable care for his safety, and cannot be held to have assumed the risk attributable to the operation of the train at an unusually high and dangerous rate of speed, until made aware of the danger, unless the speed and the consequent danger were so obvious that an ordinarily careful person in his situation would have observed the one and appreciated the other. Gila Valley, G. & N. R. Co. v. Hall, \n232 \nU.S. 94, 101\n, 58 S. L. ed. 521, 534, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 504\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1062, 1070, L.R.A. 1915C, 1, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475, 8 N. C. C. A. 834.\n It is argued that, so far as the question of assumed risks is concerned, it makes no difference, in the case of a brakeman about to board a moving train, whether it is operated at a low or at a high rate of speed; that if the train is moving slowly the risk is an ordinary one, incident to the business of railroading; while if it is moving rapidly, the risk is open, obvious, and apparent. Were we to consider only extreme cases, such as were instanced in argument, the point might be conceded; that is, that mounting a train operated at 1 mile per hour is an ordinary risk, while mounting a train operated at 50 miles per hour presents a risk which, although extraordinary, is open, obvious, and apparent. But these extremes do not present an apt illustration. A speed very much below 50 miles would endanger the brakeman's safety, at the same time being much less apparent. If those operating the train \n\n[241 U.S. 310, 315]\n\u00a0\n in question knew that plaintiff intended to board it at that point,-and the verdict is to that effect,-the jury was warranted in finding that plaintiff had a right to expect that the train would be moving at a moderate rate of speed such as would enable an ordinarily careful brakeman to get on with reasonable safety; and this upon the ground that, as head brakeman, plaintiff had the right-indeed, that it was his duty-to get upon the engine, since otherwise the train would be left without a head brakeman and the engineer without the information required for the safe operation of the train; and that plaintiff had no notice nor any opportunity to determine with reasonable certainty what the speed of the train was, or that it was too great for his safety, until the engine had practically reached him. It cannot be said, as matter of law, that a speed of 12 miles per hour would necessarily be obvious to him as a dangerous speed, before he made the attempt to board the train.\n It is insisted that the true test is not whether the employee did, in fact, know the speed of the train and appreciate the danger, but whether he ought to have known and comprehended; whether, in effect, he ought to have anticipated and taken precautions to discover the danger. This is inconsistent with the rule repeatedly laid down and uniformly adhered to by this court. According to our decisions, the settled rule is not that it is the duty of an employee to exercise care to discover extraordinary dangers that may arise from the negligence of the employer or of those for whose conduct the employer is responsible, but that the employee may assume that the employer or his agents have exercised proper care with respect to his safety until notified to the contrary, unless the want of care and the danger arising from it are so obvious that an ordinarily careful person, under the circumstances, would observe and appreciate them. Ibid. \n\n[241 U.S. 310, 316]\n\u00a0\n We conclude that there was no error in refusing to peremptorily instruct the jury to return a verdict in favor of defendant.\n Error is assigned to the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury as follows: That when plaintiff entered defendant's service as brakeman he assumed all the ordinary risks and hazards of that employment, and if the jury should believe from the evidence that his injuries were the natural and direct result of any of such risks or hazards, they must find for the defendant. The instruction thus requested was defective, and there was no error in refusing to give it in this form, since it embodied no definition of 'ordinary risks and hazards,' nor any qualification appropriate to the particular facts of the case. The gravamen of plaintiff's complaint, as developed at the trial, and the sole theory upon which the case was submitted to the jury, was that the negligence of the engineer in operating the train at an unduly high rate of speed created an unusual and extraordinary hazard. An instruction upon the question of assumption of risk, dealing solely with the ordinary hazards of the employment, and not pointing out that a different rule must be applied with respect to an extraordinary risk attributable to the engineer's negligence, would probably have confused and misled the jury.\n But it appears that in Kentucky there is an established rule of practice, that if instructions are offered upon any issue respecting which the jury should be instructed, but they are incorrect in form or substance, it is the duty of the trial court to prepare or direct the preparation of a proper instruction upon the point in the place of the defective ones.

Roberts, 144 Ky. 820, 824, 139 S. W. 1073\n\n\n Although the present action was based upon a Federal \n\n[241 U.S. 310, 317]\n\u00a0\n statute, it was triable and tried in a state court; hence local rules of practice and procedure were applicable. Central Vermont R. Co. v. White, \n238 \nU.S. 507, 511\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1433, 1436, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 865, 9 N. C. C. A. 265; Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Bombolis, No. 478, this day decided [ \n241 U.S. 211\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595]. The Kentucky court of appeals assumed for the purposes of the decision that the case was one where the trial court ought to have followed the local practice and prepared or directed the preparation of a proper instruction covering the question of assumption of risk; and it sustained the judgment only upon the ground that there was no question for the jury respecting it. Whether there was is a question of law, and of course, in this case, a Federal question; and since the court of appeals assumed to decide it, it is incumbent upon us to review the decision. North Carolina R. Co. v. Zachary, \n233 \nU.S. 248, 257\n, 58 S. L. ed. 591, 595, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 159.\n We are unable to concur in the view that there was no question for the jury. Whether the risk was an extraordinary risk depended upon whether the speed of the train was greater than plaintiff reasonably might have anticipated; and this rested upon the same considerations that were determinative of the question of the engineer's negligence. If the jury should find, as in fact they did find, that the speed of the train was unduly great, so that the risk of boarding the engine was an extraordinary risk, the question whether plaintiff assumed it then depended upon whether he was aware that the speed was excessive, and appreciated the extraordinary danger; or, if not, then upon whether the undue speed and the consequent danger to him were so obvious that an ordinarily prudent person in his situation would have realized and appreciated them. The court of appeals reasoned that plaintiff's duties required him to be upon the passing train; that if he failed to board it he would be left behind; that he had a right to assume the engineer would run the train at a speed that would enable him to get on in safety; \n\n[241 U.S. 310, 318]\n\u00a0\n that he was facing the train, which was going directly toward him; that, as a matter of common knowledge, one standing in that position cannot form an accurate judgment of its speed until it comes quite near to him; and that his opportunity to observe the speed was limited to the brief space of time that elapsed between the passing of the front end of the engine and the cab, where it was his purpose to get on; and the court determined that, under such circumstances, 'it is well-nigh impossible to tell the difference between a rate of from 4 to 6 miles an hour, when an ordinarily prudent brakeman might get on with reasonable safety, and a rate of from 10 to 12 miles an hour, when it would be dangerous for him to do so;' and that 'all the circumstances tend to show that knowledge of the speed of the train came to him so suddenly and unexpectedly that he did not have an opportunity to realize and appreciate the danger of getting on.' Conceding the force of the reasoning, we are bound to say that, in our opinion, it cannot be said, as matter of law, to be so incontrovertible that reasonable minds might not differ about the conclusion that should be reached. We therefore hold that the question of assumption of risk was one proper for submission to the jury, and, assuming, as the court assumed, that the local practice required the preparation of a proper instruction covering the topic, in the place of the defective instruction that was offered, there was error in affirming the judgment of the trial court.\n Judgment reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Holmes dissent. \n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESAPEAKE & O R.

Leake, and Henry Taylor, Jr., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Hill Carter and C. V. Meredith for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action brought in the United States district court under the Federal employers' liability act of April 22, 1908 (chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657).\n Plaintiff was a brakeman in defendant's employ, and, during the night of July 2, 1912, was called for duty at Gladstone, Virginia, to take his place as head brakeman on a fast interstate freight train, known as a 'manifest train,' comprising about forty cars, which had just come into the division terminal yard at Gladstone and was about to be taken forward. He got upon the road engine and this was attached to the train, plaintiff making the coupling. Just after this he met the yard master, who had charge of all the work done in the yard, whose orders plaintiff was bound to obey, and who told plaintiff, according to his testimony, to 'cut out three cars at the head end of the train [numbers 2, 3, and 4] and switch them off on a side track and come back and couple up, and they would be ready to go.' Plaintiff proceeded with the road engine and crew to take out the three cars, returned to the main track with the engine and car number 1, coupled the latter to the forward end of the train, and was in the act of coupling up the air hose, an operation that required him to step between the rails. While \n\n[241 U.S. 462, 464]\n\u00a0\n he was in this position, a collision took place, caused by the acts of the yard crew, who (unknown to plaintiff), under orders of the yard master, and with the aid of the yard engine, were engaged in switching cars at the rear end of the train, and who, negligently, as the jury doubtless found, drove a cut of twenty-nine cars into the standing cars (about eight in number) with undue violence. According to the testimony of the road engineer and fireman the jar of the impact was such that, although their engine was standing, with its independent brakes set, it was thrown forward 20 feet along the track. Naturally plaintiff was knocked down and run over, and he sustained serious personal injuries, including the loss of an arm.\n In view of the character of the question that is to be passed upon, a somewhat particular recital of the evidence is necessary. There was testimony that when a manifest train came into a terminal yard such as Gladstone, destined to points further along the line, the engine and caboose were changed and sometimes cars were taken out and others brought into the train; and that, in order to save time, it was customary to have such shifting operations, when necessary, done at both ends of the train, the road engine and road crew operating at the front, the yard engine and yard crew at the rear. Whether plaintiff knew of this custom was, under the evidence, open to dispute. He at one time denied that he knew it was customary for both ends of a manifest train to be 'worked' at the same time; and while this was afterwards qualified, it appears not to have been withdrawn. He admitted that it was customary to follow the instructions of the yard master, but denied that on this occasion the yard master told him anything to the effect that the rear end of the train was to be worked. He testified that he had no notice that anything was to be done at that end of the train beyond attaching the caboose, and that \n\n[241 U.S. 462, 465]\n\u00a0\n after putting the second, third, and fourth cars upon the side track, and coming back to the train, he looked up the track, which was straight, saw no lamp or other signal, and then proceeded with his coupling operations, with the result already mentioned. Whether it was usual, in conducting such switching operations, to have a man at the forward end of the moving cut of cars, was in dispute. Plaintiff testified that 'it is the custom to have a man on the front end of a cut of cars that is being switched into other cars, who looks out for that and runs and stops the engine just before they get there, in making the coupling.' Two of defendant's witnesses contradicted this; one in terms denying the custom of giving a warning as stated by plaintiff; the other declaring that 'all the warning he knew of being given, or the practice, was for the men in and about the train to take care of themselves and see for his own danger when he attempts to do any work, and the witness knew of no signals given;' while another and experienced witness, called by defendant, being asked if it was customary when running in a cut of cars to have a man on the front end with a light, replied: 'Well, on the yard in switching cars they come right down to the book rule. It says where cars are being shoved a man must be placed on the head car.' Whether there was a man at the forward end of the cut of cars that produced the collision in question was in controversy. As to plaintiff's opportunity to gain knowledge of the alleged custom, it did not distinctly appear that he had previously worked on a manifest train. He testified that he had been employed as brakeman something more than five years, part of the time as an extra man and part of the time as a regular man; that he was an extra man when hurt; had been a regular brakeman until about three weeks before the accident, when he was 'pulled off the local freight.'\n Plaintiff recovered a verdict for substantial damages, \n\n[241 U.S. 462, 466]\n\u00a0\n and the judgment was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 134 C. C. A. 37, 218 Fed. 23.\n There are numerous assignments of error, but most of them are manifestly unfounded. The only ones requiring notice are based upon the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury in accordance with defendant's Request B, and the modified instruction that was given in its stead. The requested instruction was, in substance: That if the jury believed from the evidence that the method adopted by defendant in making up the train on the occasion in question was the usual and ordinary method of doing this work, then plaintiff assumed all the risks incident to that method, and they should not find a verdict in his favor because of any injury received on account of said method of doing the work, even though it was the direct and proximate cause of his injury. The instruction given was, in substance: That defendant had the right to adopt reasonable rules and regulations for the conduct and method of handling its trains in its yards, and of making up trains for their departure therefrom, and that if the jury believed from the evidence that the custom prevailed in the Gladstone yard of making up the train from both ends at the same time, that is to say, by working the train engine and crew at the forward end and the yard engine and its crew at the rear end, and that such method was one that reasonably prudent and careful men would have adopted in the conduct of the business, then the plaintiff assumed the risks reasonably and usually incident to and arising from such method of making up trains, and they should not find a verdict in his favor because of any injury received solely on account of said method of making up the train, although they believed from the evidence that the method adopted was the proximate cause of the injury.\n The argument for plaintiff in error is that an employee assumes the risks arising from the employer's method of \n\n[241 U.S. 462, 467]\n\u00a0\n doing the work, where the dangers are open, obvious, or known to the employee, even though they be due to the employer's negligence in establishing the method or system; that the customary method of shifting and coupling cars at both ends of a manifest train at the same time, without notice or warning to those working at the other end, was open, obvious, and known to plaintiff; and that he therefore assumed the risk of any injury from that source.\n It appears to have been conceded by plaintiff in the circuit court of appeals that the attaching and detaching of cars by working on both ends of the train at the same time was customary at the Gladstone yard; but it does not appear to have been conceded in that court or in the trial court that plaintiff knew of this custom, or had had such opportunity for knowledge as to be charged with notice of it. Nor was it conceded that the custom included the pushing in of a cut of cars without a man at their head to give warning to other workmen and to signal the engineer to slacken speed. As already shown, the evidence left these matters open to dispute.\n There are several reasons why error cannot be attributed to the trial court for refusing the requested instruction B.\n\n\n (a)\n The evidence left it in doubt what method was adopted in making up the train in question and what was the usual and ordinary method, and the request therefore failed to define what state of facts should charge plaintiff with an assumption of the risk.\n\n\n (b)\n The request ignored the question whether plaintiff had knowledge or was chargeable with notice of the customary method. The argument in effect concedes, what is plainly inferable from the evidence, that the danger to a brakeman at work in switching at one end of a manifest train, arising from switching operations conducted by another crew at the other end, is not among the ordinary \n\n[241 U.S. 462, 468]\n\u00a0\n risks of a brakeman's employment. But, if it was an unusual and extraordinary danger, plaintiff could not be held to have assumed it, in the absence of knowledge or notice on his part. To subject an employee, without warning, to unusual dangers not normally incident to the employment, is itself an act of negligence. And, as has been laid down in repeated decisions of this court, while an employee assumes the risks and dangers ordinarily incident to the employment in which he voluntarily engages, so far as these are not attributable to the negligence of the employer or of those for whose conduct the employer is responsible, the employee has a right to assume that the employer has exercised proper care with respect to providing a reasonably safe place of work (and this includes care in establishing a reasonably safe system or method of work), and is not to be treated as assuming a risk that is attributable to the employer's negligence until he becomes aware of it, or it is so plainly observable that he must be presumed to have known of it. The employee is not obliged to exercise care to discover dangers not ordinarily incident to the employment, but which result from the employer's negligence. Texas & P. R. Co. v. Archibald, \n170 \nU.S. 665, 671\n, 672 S., 42 L. ed. 1188, 1191, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 777, 4 Am. Neg. Rep. 746; Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. McDade, \n191 \nU.S. 64, 68\n, 48 S. L. ed. 96, 100, 24 Am.

A. 834.\n\n\n (c)\n The request required defendant to be acquitted if the usual method of doing the work was pursued, irrespective of the question of the negligence of the yard crew in carrying it out. Negligence in the doing of the work was the gravamen of plaintiff's complaint, in his declaration as in his evidence, and defendant was not entitled to an instruction making the pursuit of a customary system decisive of the issue, without regard to whether due care was exercised in doing the work itself. Even if plaintiff knew and assumed the risks of an inherently \n\n[241 U.S. 462, 469]\n\u00a0\n dangerous method of doing the work, he did not assume the increased risk attributable not to the method, but to negligence in pursuing it. Had the instruction been given in form as requested, the jury, in view of the issue and the evidence, might easily have interpreted it as meaning that if defendant's employees usually and customarily made up trains in such a manner that by a violent collision produced by negligent switching operations at the rear end of a long train a brakeman engaged in the performance of his duties at the forward end, and having no notice or warning of the rear-end switching, was in danger of serious personal injury, there was no liability. This, of course, is not the law.\n Nor is the modification of the requested instruction a matter of which defendant may complain. The court evidently understood the request as meaning no more than what it said, and as not intended to embrace the hypothesis that plaintiff knew or had notice that the usual method of making up trains was that adopted on the occasion in question. In the absence of such knowledge or notice, the custom could not be made binding upon plaintiff; certainly not without a finding that it was one that a reasonably careful employer would have adopted. It was this finding that the modification called for.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESAPEAKE & O. R. CO. v.

Walsh for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Error to review a judgment in favor of defendant in error for $25,000 damages for injuries sustained through the asserted negligence of plaintiff in error.\n The action was at law under the employers' liability act of Congress. 35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657; 36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143. In accordance with the state law it was tried to a jury of seven. This is assigned as error. The only other assignment is upon an instruction of the court as to the elements of damage. There is no dispute as to the fact of injury, or that it was received in interstate commerce, and by the negligence of plaintiff in error.\n\n\n (1)\n The first assignment of error is based upon a challenge by the railway company to the array of jurors on the ground that the jury was not summoned, selected, formed, and constituted as provided by the Constitution of the United States. In other words, the contention is 'that in the trial of cases under the employers' liability act of Congress the parties are entitled to a common-law jury of twelve men, as provided for by the 7th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.'\n The assignment is without foundation. Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Bombolis, decided this day [\n241 U.S. 211\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595]. \n\n[241 U.S. 241, 243]\n\u00a0\n (2) The instruction which is the basis of the second assignment of error is as follows:\n'The court instructs the jury that if they believe from a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is liable to the plaintiff in this action, then in assessing damages against the defendant, they may take into consideration the pain and suffering of the plaintiff, his mental anguish, the bodily injury sustained by him, his pecuniary loss, his loss of power and capacity for work and its effect upon his future, not however, in excess of $35,000, as to them may seem just and fair.' [-- Va. --, 86 S. E. 863.]\n\n It is objected (a) that the instruction permitted a recovery in damages not only for those which proximately resulted from the injury, but also for 'its effects upon the future,' which involved a consideration of consequences which might be essentially speculative and remote. (b) The instruction directed the jury that the damages might be in such sum not in excess of $35,000 as to them might seem just and fair. By the instruction the court called the attention of the jury to a certain sum and gave iudicial approval of it, giving them to understand that they could give such sum as they might deem just and fair, without regard to the damages the evidence might prove.\n The injury received is pertinent to the consideration of the instruction. In the collision of two trains defendant in error, who was a fireman, 'was caught' (we quote from the opinion of the supreme court) 'from his knee of his right leg down, between the tank on the tender and the boiler head in the cab of his engine, and remained pinned in that position for forty-five or fifty minutes before he was extricated by the efforts of his fellow workmen. His leg was so badly mashed and burned that it eventually had to be amputated at a point between the knee and the thigh, and it is for these injuries and his consequent sufferings that he sues to recover damages.' \n\n[241 U.S. 241, 244]\n\u00a0\n The supreme court expressed the view that the speculation of future results which the railway company professed to apprehend was not left by the instruction for the jury to indulge, nor did the instruction commit the amount of damages to the conjecture of the jury independently of the evidence in the case. The contention made here was explicitly rejected, viz., that the instruction permitted the jury to take into consideration the 'possible future physical effects from the injury, such as future suffering in the absence of evidence as to the probability of such.' The court remarked that it would be a strained construction of the language of the instruction 'to hold that it referred to future suffering, and that damages not the proximate result of the injuries received were included under' it, and that, besides, such conclusion was precluded by an instruction given at the request of the railway company, which was 'that in order for the plaintiff to recover in this case he must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the injuries he sustained were the direct and proximate result of the negligence of the defendant.'\n The comment of the court is accurate and we can add nothing to it. The principle is established that when the evidence in a case shows that there will be future effects from an injury, an instruction which justifies an inclusion of them in an award of damages is not error. Washington & G. R. Co. v. Harmon (Washington & G. R. Co. v. Tobriner), \n147 U.S. 571\n, 37 L. ed. 284, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 557; McDermott v. Severe, \n202 U.S. 600\n, 50 L. ed. 1162, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 709.\n It is also objected that the instruction 'allowed the jury to indulge in speculation and conjecture; invited their attention to the sum of $35, 000, and allowed the jury to give such sum as damages as to them might 'seem just and fair' without stating that the damages could be only such as were proved by the evidence to have proximately resulted from the negligent act complained of.'\n The objection is untenable. As we have seen, the court \n\n[241 U.S. 241, 245]\n\u00a0\n explicitly enjoined upon the jury that there must be a proximate and causal relation between the damages and the negligence of the company, and the reference to the sum of $35,000 was a limitation of the amount stated in the declaration. There could have been no misunderstanding of the purpose of the instruction. Norfolk & W. R. Co. v. Earnest, \n229 \nU.S. 114, 119\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1096, 1100, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 654, Ann.

Stat. 1916,  8862). It was brought to recover damages for the death of Richard Dwyer, caused by the negligence of the railroad company, while he was in its employ in interstate commerce. The sole beneficiary was decedent's widow, who originally qualified as administratrix and brought the action, but has died since the allowance of the present writ of error.\n Laying aside a contention based upon the 7th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, which has been disposed of in Minneapolis & St. P. R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241 \n241 U.S. 211\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595, the only question raised relates to the method adopted in ascertaining the damages. The jury returned a verdict for $16,000. On appeal to the Kentucky court of appeals it was insisted that this amount was grossly excessive, and was the result of erroneous instructions to the jury. It was contended that the verdict of $16,000 if placed at interest would yield an annual income greater than the amount the widow would have received had she lived, and would yet leave her the principal to dispose of at the time of her death. The court overruled this contention, on the authority of Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Kelly, 160 Ky. 296, 169 S. W. 736, where the same court held that in such a case the whole loss is sustained at the time of intestate's death, and is to be included in the verdict without rebate or discount. A reading of the opinion of the court of appeals in the present case (162 Ky. 427, 172 S. W. 918) makes it evident that it was only upon this theory that the court was able to reach a conclusion sustaining the verdict. Since we have held, in Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Kelly, this day decided [ \n241 U.S. 485\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 630], that the theory is erroneous, it results that the judgment here under review must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Death of Sarah Dwyer suggested, and appearance of James R.

Stat. 1913,  8662), defendant in error, as administratrix of Matt Kelly, deceased, recovered a judgment in the Mont- \n\n[241 U.S. 485, 487]\n\u00a0\n gomery circuit court for damages because of the death of the intestate while employed by plaintiff in error in interstate commerce. The verdict was for $19,011, which was apportioned among the widow and infant children of the deceased, excluding a son who had attained his majority. The court of appeals of Kentucky affirmed the judgment, and denied a rehearing. 160 Ky. 296, 169 S. W. 736, 161 Ky. 655, 171 S. W. 185.\n Upon the present writ of error the first contention is that the limitation of the 7th Amendment to the Federal Constitution preserving the common-law right of trial by jury inheres in every right of action created under the authority of that Constitution, and that because, as is said, the courts of Kentucky are unable to secure that right to litigants by reason of a law of the state, passed pursuant to a provision of its Constitution, by the terms of which in all trials of civil actions in the circuit courts three-fourths or more of the jurors concurring may return a verdict, those courts are without jurisdiction of actions arising under the Federal employers' liability act. This contention has been set at rest by our recent decision in Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Bombolis, \n241 U.S. 211\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595.\n The only other matter requiring consideration is the instruction of the trial court, affirmed by the court of appeals, respecting the method of ascertaining the damages. We may say in passing that while the act of Congress does not require that in such cases damages be apportioned among the beneficiaries (Central Vermont R. Co. v. White, \n238 \nU.S. 507, 515\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1433, 1438, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 865, 9 N. C. C. A. 265), it is not in the present case insisted that the act prohibits such an apportionment, and if there be any question about this it is not now before us.\n Respecting the matter with which we have to deal, the trial court, after stating that if the jury should find for the plaintiff they should fix the damages at such sum \n\n[241 U.S. 485, 488]\n\u00a0\n as would reasonably compensate the dependent members of Kelly's family for the pecuniary loss, if any, shown by the evidence to have been sustained by them because of Kelly's injury and death; and that, in fixing the amount, they were authorized to take into consideration the evidence showing the decedent's age, habits, business ability, earning capacity, and probable duration of life, and also the pecuniary loss, if any, which the jury might find from the evidence that the dependent members of his family had sustained because of being deprived of such maintenance or support or other pecuniary advantage, if any, which the jury might believe from the evidence they would have derived from his life thereafter,- proceeded as follows: 'If the jury find for the plaintiff they will find a gross sum for the plaintiff against the defendant which must not exceed the probable earnings of Matt Kelly had he lived. The gross sum to be found for plaintiff, if the jury find for the plaintiff, must be the aggregate of the sums which the jury may find from the evidence and fix as the pecuniary loss above described, which each dependent member of Matt Kelly's family may have sustained by his death;' following this with an instruction respecting the apportionment, with which, as we have said, we are not now concerned. Defendant requested an instruction that the jury should 'fix the damages at that sum which represents the present cash value of the reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage . . . to said Addie Kelly during her widowhood and while dependent, and pecuniary advantage to said infant children while dependent and until they become twenty-one years of age.' This was refused.\n Laying aside questions of form, the court of appeals treated the instruction given and the refusal of the requested instruction as raising the question 'that what the beneficiary is entitled to is not a lump sum equal to what he would receive during the estimated term of de- \n\n[241 U.S. 485, 489]\n\u00a0\n pendency, but the present cash value of such aggregate amount.' Defendant's contention was overruled upon the ground that the whole loss of the beneficiaries is sustained at the time of the death of the party in question, the court saying: 'While that loss is, in a measure, future support, the father's death precipitated it, so that it is all due, and we are not impressed with the argument that the sum due should be reduced by rebate or discount. The value of a father's support is not so difficult to estimate, and the average juryman is competent to compute it, but to figure interest on deferred payments, with annual rests, and reach a present cash value of such loss to each dependent is more than ought to be asked of anyone less qualified than an actuary.' [160 Ky. 303.]\n We are constrained to say that, in our opinion, the court of appeals erred in its conclusion upon this point. The damages should be equivalent to compensation for the deprivation of the reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefits that would have resulted from the continued life of the deceased. Michigan C. R. Co. v. Vreeland, \n227 \nU.S. 59, 70\n, 71 S., 57 L. ed. 417, 421, 422, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 176; American R. Co. v. Didricksen, \n227 \nU.S. 145, 149\n, 57 S.

So far as a verdict is based upon the deprivation of future benefits, it will afford more than compensation if it be made up by aggregating the benefits without taking account of the earning power of the money that is presently to be awarded. It is selfevident that a given sum of money in hand is worth more than the like sum of money payable in the future. Ordinarily a person seeking to recover damages for the wrongful act of another must do that which a reasonable man would do under the circumstances to limit the amount of the damages. Wicker v. Hoppock, 6 Wall. 94, 99, 18 L. ed. 752, 753; The Baltimore, 8 Wall. 377, 387, 19 L. ed. 463, 465; United States v. Smith, \n94 \nU.S. 214, 218\n, 24 S. L. ed. 115; Warren v. Stoddart, \n105 \nU.S. 224, 229\n, 26 S. L. ed. 1117, 1120; United States v. United States Fidelity & G. Co. \n236 \nU.S. 512, 526\n, 59 S. L. ed. 696, 703, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 298. And \n\n[241 U.S. 485, 490]\n\u00a0\n the putting out of money at interest is at this day so common a matter that ordinarily it cannot be excluded from consideration in determining the present equivalent of future payments, since a reasonable man, even from selfish motives, would probably gain some money by way of interest upon the money recovered. Savings banks and other established financial institutions are in many cases accessible for the deposit of moderate sums at interest, without substantial danger of loss; the sale of annuities is not unknown; and, for larger sums, state and municipal bonds and other securities of almost equal standing are commonly available.\n Local conditions are not to be disregarded, and besides, there may be cases where the anticipated pecuniary advantage of which the beneficiary has been deprived covers an expectancy so short and is in the aggregate so small that a reasonable man could not be expected to make an investment or purchase an annuity with the proceeds of the judgment. But, as a rule, and in all cases where it is reasonable to suppose that interest may safely be earned upon the amount that is awarded, the ascertained future benefits ought to be discounted in the making up of the award.\n We do not mean to say that the discount should be at what is commonly called the 'legal rate' of interest; that is, the rate limited by law, beyond which interest is prohibited. It may be that such rates are not obtainable upon investments on safe securities, at least, without the exercise of financial experience and skill in the administration of the fund; and it is evident that the compensation should be awarded upon a basis that does not call upon the beneficiaries to exercise such skill, for where this is necessarily employed, the interest return is in part earned by the investor rather than by the investment. This, however, is a matter that ordinarily may be adjusted by scaling the rate of interest to be adopted in computing \n\n[241 U.S. 485, 491]\n\u00a0\n the present value of the future benefits; it being a matter of common knowledge that, as a rule, the best and safest investments, and those which require the least care, yield only a moderate return.\n We are not in this case called upon to lay down a precise rule or formula, and it is not our purpose to do this, but merely to indicate some of the considerations that support the view we have expressed that, in computing the damages recoverable for the deprivation of future benefits, the principle of limiting the recovery to compensation requires that adequate allowance be made, according to circumstances, for the earning power of money; in short, that when future payments or other pecuniary benefits are to be anticipated, the verdict should be made up on the basis of their present value only.\n We are aware that it may be a difficult mathematical computation for the ordinary juryman to calculate interest on deferred payments, with annual rests, and reach a present cash value. Whether the difficulty should be met by admitting the testimony of expert witnesses, or by receiving in evidence the standard interest and annuity tables in which present values are worked out at various rates of interest and for various periods covering the ordinary expectancies of life, it is not for us in this case to say. Like other questions of procedure and evidence, it is to be determined according to the law of the forum.\n But the question of the proper measure of damages is inseparably connected with the right of action, and in cases arising under the Federal employers' liability act it must be settled according to general principles of law as administered in the Federal courts.\n We are not reminded that in any previous case in this court the precise question now presented has been necessarily involved. But in two cases the applicability of present values has been recognized.\n Vicksburg & M. R. Co. v. Putnam, \n118 U.S. 545\n, 30 L. ed. 257, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1, 10 Am. Neg. Cas. 574, was a \n\n[241 U.S. 485, 492]\n\u00a0\n review of a judgment recovered in a circuit court of the United States in an action for personal injuries where the damages claimed included compensation for the impairment of plaintiff's earning capacity. Assuming, for purposes of illustration, that plaintiff's expectancy of life was thirty years, the trial judge instructed the jury (p. 551) that it would not be proper to allow him in gross the sum of the annual losses during his expectancy, 'for the annuity will be payable one part this year and another part next year, and each of the thirty parts payable each of the thirty years. You must have a sum such that, when he dies, it will all be used up at the end of thirty years.' Having called attention to certain tables that were in evidence, he proceeded to say: 'Add that to the present worth of annuity if you find he was damaged.' The judgment was reversed, not because of the recognition of the rule of present values, but because of the conclusive force that was given by the trial judge to the life and annuity tables. In the course of the opinion the court, by Mr. Justice Gray, said (p. 554) that the compensation should include 'a fair recompense for the loss of what he would otherwise have earned in his trade or profession, and has been deprived of the capacity of earning by the wrongful act of the defendant. . . . In order to assist the jury in making such an estimate, standard life and annuity tables, showing at any age the probable duration of life, and the present value of a life annuity, are competent evidence. . . . But it has never been held that the rules to be derived from such tables or computations must be the absolute guides of the judgment and the conscience of the jury.'\n In Pierce v. Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. \n173 U.S. 1\n, 43 L. ed. 591, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 335, 5 Am. Neg. Rep. 747, which was an action founded upon defendant's breach and abandonment of a contract of employment construed by this court to be limited only by plaintiff's life, the trial court ruled (p. 6) that no recovery could be allowed be- \n\n[241 U.S. 485, 493]\n\u00a0\n yond the instalments of wages due up to the date of the trial, refusing to charge, as requested by plaintiff, that he was 'entitled to the full benefit of his contract, which is the present value of the money agreed to be paid and the articles to be furnished under the contract for the period of his life, if his disability is permanent,' etc. This court held (p. 10) that the circuit court had erred in restricting the damages as mentioned, and in declining to instruct the jury in accordance with plaintiff's request; citing Vicksburg & M. R. Co. v. Putnam, ubi supra, and quoting the reference to the 'present value of a life annuity;' and also citing (p. 13) Schell v. Plumb, 55 N. Y. 592, and making the following quotation from the opinion of the court of appeals of New York in that case: 'Here the contract of the testator was to support the plaintiff during her life. That was a continuing contract during that period; but the contract was entire, and a total breach put an end to it, and gave the plaintiff a right to recover an equivalent in damages, which equivalent was the present value of her contract.'\n That where future payments are to be anticipated and capitalized in a verdict the plaintiff is entitled to no more than their present worth is commonly recognized in the state courts. We cite some of the cases, but without intending to approve any of the particular formulae that have been followed in applying the principle; since in this respect the decisions are not harmonious, and some of them may be subject to question.

Harrington for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n We have here under review a judgment of the supreme court of Nebraska, affirming a judgment in favor of de- \n\n[241 U.S. 470, 471]\n\u00a0\n fendant in error in an action based upon the Federal employers' liability act of April 22, 1908 (chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657), for the loss of an eye caused by the breaking of a lubricator glass on a locomotive engine upon which he was at work as engineer in the employ of plaintiff in error. 96 Neb. 419, 148 N. W. 145.\n No question is made but that the cause of action arose in interstate commerce so as to bring the case within the Federal act. The facts upon which the question of liability depends are these: The plaintiff in the action (defendant in error) was an experienced locomotive engineer. At the time of his injury, which occurred at night in the month of November, 1910, he had just oiled his engine, taken it from the roundhouse, and placed it upon the outgoing track in readiness for his run. The engine was equipped with a Nathan lubricator, an appliance containing oil for the steam cylinders and the air pump, the oil being conducted to and within the parts where needed under steam pressure from the boiler. In order to give the engineer a view of the interior of the apparatus, and thus enable him to see that the oil was dropping, three cylindrical glass tubes were attached, one carrying the oil for each steam cylinder and one for the air pump. Each of these glasses was surrounded with a shield of perforated metal in two parts, hinged together and lightly clamped upon the glass tube by means of a spring to hold it in place. When the lubricator was in operation, the tubes were required to sustain the same steam pressure as the boiler. These tubular glasses would sometimes break. This was most liable to occur: (1) when a glass was newly installed, and before it had been properly tempered; (2) when it was subjected to a sudden change of temperature, as when steam was admitted to it while cold; and (3) they would, after six or seven weeks' use, sometimes 'wear thin' and break for this reason. The metal shield was designed in part, at least, to prevent injury to the \n\n[241 U.S. 470, 472]\n\u00a0\n engineer from flying pieces in case the glass should break. This type of lubricator had been in use for over twenty years, and had been used upon all defendant's engines down to a time between three and four years prior to the accident. Then a new type, known as the Bull's Eye, came into use, and was recognized as a better appliance because, being unbreakable, it was safer for the engineer, and at the same time obviated the loss of time and delay of trains attributable to breakage of lubricators of the Nathan type; and defendant began to instal Bull's Eye lubricators in the place of the older type upon engines already in use, and to place them upon all new engines. During the earlier period of the use of the Nathan, and before the construction of locomotives of classes Q and R, the engines carried only 140 to 150 pounds boiler pressure, while engines of the classes mentioned carried 190 pounds. An experienced witness called by defendant testified that, at the time of the trial (about a year after the accident), approximately 25 per cent of the engines were still using the Nathan lubricator and 75 per cent were equipped with the Bull's Eye; that the Bull's Eye was and had been, for three or four years, recognized as 'the proper appliance;' that the Nathan was dangerous to the men, and that the change was being made partly because of this and partly because the breaking of the old style lubricator sometimes delayed trains.\n Plaintiff testified that during most of the time for the past twenty years he had operated locomotives equipped with Nathan lubricators having tubular glasses, but not all of these were high-pressure engines. The engine on which he was injured was of class R, and carried a boiler pressure of 190 pounds. He had operated it for about two months prior to the time of his injury. During his experience of twenty years, lubricator glasses had broken with him on three previous occasions, the last being about three weeks before the occurrence in question. At this \n\n[241 U.S. 470, 473]\n\u00a0\n time he asked that a Bull's Eye be substituted on his engine. He testified that this was not because he considered the old lubricator dangerous, but because he wanted to save time on the road in the event of a breakdown. He also testified that he knew that when a new glass was put into a Nathan lubricator it was liable to burst if the steam was turned on suddenly, or if steam was turned on quickly in cold weather, and that on the occasion in question, following the correct practice, he first partially opened the throttles, admitting the steam to the tubes to warm them, afterwards fully opening the throttles, and that it was about seven minutes after this was done that the explosion occurred.\n The trial court submitted the case to the jury with instructions to the effect that the burden of proof was upon plaintiff to show that defendant had carelessly and negligently maintained the shield and spring and glass in the lubricator in a weak and dangerous condition, that the lubricator glass was not of sufficient strength for use upon the engine in question or any other engine carrying 190 pounds of steam, and that this fact was known to defendant, or that its experience with said glass and lubricator had been such that it ought to have known that the same was insufficient and dangerous; and that if they believed from a preponderance of the evidence that defendant was thus negligent, and that plaintiff was injured as a result of it, they should find for the plaintiff, otherwise for the defendant.\n The principal controversy is as to whether the evidence was sufficient to go to the jury upon the question of defendant's negligence in furnishing the locomotive in question with a lubricator having tubular glasses as described.\n The rule of law is: That the employer is under a duty to exercise ordinary care to supply machinery and appliances reasonably safe and suitable for the use of the em- \n\n[241 U.S. 470, 474]\n\u00a0\n ployee, but is not required to furnish the latest, best, and safest appliances, or to discard standard appliances upon the discovery of later improvements, provided those in use are reasonably safe and suitable. Washington & G. R. Co. v. McDade, \n135 \nU.S. 554, 570\n, 34 S. L. ed. 235, 241, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1044; Patton v. Texas & P. R. Co. \n179 \nU.S. 658, 664\n, 45 S. L. ed. 361, 364, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 275. In our opinion, a correct application of this rule required the present case to be submitted to the jury. Properly limiting the inquiry (and, as we have seen, the trial court did so limit it), there was no question of attributing negligence to an employer for merely failing to promptly instal the latest, best, and safest appliance; it was a question of keeping an older type of appliance in use after its insufficiency had been demonstrated by experience, and perhaps under conditions materially different from those which had obtained when its use began, in the face of notice that it was not reasonably safe and suitable. It was reasonably inferable from the evidence that defendant's experience had shown that a glass tube capable of withstanding the lower pressures of 140 to 150 pounds could not be relied upon to withstand a pressure of 190 pounds, and that the difficulty could not be obviated, as was attempted, by using thicker glass for the tubes, because its very thickness increased the danger of bursting when steam was first admitted; there being evidence from a witness called by defendant that the older type of lubricater was a dangerous instrument to be used upon a high-pressure boiler, and that they broke rather frequently; that it was for this reason, in part, that defendant had introduced the Bull's Eye, beginning three or four years before the accident, installing them first upon high-pressure engines of the Q and R classes, and having already placed them upon a majority of defendant's engines of all sizes. In this state of the evidence it could not be said, as matter of law, that defendant was free from negligence in delaying so long to instal a Bull's Eye lubricator upon the engine in question. \n\n[241 U.S. 470, 475]\n\u00a0\n The only other question relates to whether plaintiff assumed the risk of performing his duty upon a locomotive equipped with the Nathan lubricator. Instructions were given to the jury upon the subject, but they are open to some criticism which perhaps can be obviated only by holding, as the supreme court of Nebraska held, that there was nothing in the evidence that would sustain a finding that plaintiff assumed the risk.\n The crucial question is whether he knew or had sufficient notice of the increased danger attributable to the employer's negligence. Plaintiff testified without contradiction that it was his understanding-he had been 'always taught to believe'-that the Nathan lubricator would stand the boiler pressure of 190 pounds. Assuming, as the undisputed evidence shows he had a right to assume, that the glass was being subjected to no greater bursting strain than it was designed to withstand, he still knew that, under special circumstances that have been pointed out, there was danger of a glass bursting unless precautions were taken. Any risk of this character, unaffected by his employer's negligence, he undoubtedly assumed, as a risk ordinarily incident to the occupation he pursued. But this throws no light upon his right to recover, because if he was subjected to no greater risk than that just now indicated, the employer was not negligent and there was no ground of recovery. Under the trial court's instructions, the jury must be presumed to have found that the Nathan lubricator glasses had been shown by experience to be incapable of withstanding a pressure of 190 pounds, that defendant knew of this, and nevertheless negligently maintained such glasses upon plaintiff's engine. There was present, therefore, an extraordinary danger, not normally incident to plaintiff's employment; it was in its nature latent, and not obvious; and there is no evidence in the record that plaintiff had received any notice or warning of the increased hazard attributable to his employer's \n\n[241 U.S. 470, 476]\n\u00a0\n negligence. In short, while he knew there were certain dangers naturally incident to the use of tubular glasses upon the lubricator, there is nothing to show that he knew or had any ground to believe that his employer had been wanting in the exercise of proper care for his safety, or that because of such want of care the danger to him was greater than it ought to have been. Without this, he could not be held to have assumed the increased risk. Gila Valley, G. & N. R. Co. v. Hall, \n232 \nU.S. 94, 101\n, 58 S. L. ed. 521, 524, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229; Seaboard Air Line R.

HARRINGTON(1916)\nNo. 853\nArgued: Decided: May 1, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 177, 178]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. O. M. Spencer, William Warner, Oliver H. Dean, H. M. Langworthy, and William D. McLeod for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. G. L. Harvey for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n Margaret Harrington brought this action to recover damages for the death of her husband, Patrick Harrington, a switchman employed by the plaintiff in error. She obtained judgment under the state law, the plaintiff in error contending unsuccessfully that the decedent was engaged in interstate commerce and that the case was governed by the Federal employers' liability act. 180 S. W. 443. The state court said, in its statement of facts:\n'Defendant owns and operates a system of railroads covering this and a number of other western states and is a common carrier of both interstate and intrastate traffic. Its terminal yards at Kansas City are in Missouri and are an important center for the handling of both kinds of business originating upon and confined to defendant's lines, as well as for the interchange of business with other interstate railroads. Locomotives and cars \n\n[241 U.S. 177, 179]\n\u00a0\n used in both kinds of traffic are received, sent out, cared for, and repaired in the yards. The switching crew of which Harrington was a member did not work outside of this state, and was engaged, at the time of his death, in switching coal belonging to defendant, and which had been standing on a storage track for some time, to the coal shed, where it was to be placed in bins or chutes and supplied, as needed, to locomotives of all classes, some of which were engaged or about to be engaged in interstate and others in intrastate traffic. It may be conceded, as argued by defendant, that none of its locomotives or cars was set apart for service only in intrastate commerce. Defendant operated local trains from Kansas City to terminal points in this state which carried only intrastate commerce, but the locomotives and cars of such trains were subject to be diverted to other trains engaged in interstate commerce.'\n\n The plaintiff in error takes exception to the statement in part, asserting that there was no evidence that any of the locomotives, which were supplied with fuel from the coal chutes, were engaged exclusively in intrastate commerce, or that any of the defendant's trains within the state were engaged exclusively in that commerce. For the present purpose, we may assume the fact to be as stated by the plaintiff in error, and we may also assume, as it insists, that there was no evidence that the coal had been brought from mines within the state of Missouri or from mines owned by the plaintiff in error. With the movement of the coal to the storage tracks, however, we are not concerned; that movement had long since ended, as it is admitted that the coal was owned by the company, and 'had been in storage in its storage tracks for a week or more prior to the time it was being switched into the coal chutes on the morning of the accident.' So, also, as the question is with respect to the employment of the decedent at the time of the injury (Illinois \n\n[241 U.S. 177, 180]\n\u00a0\n C. R. Co. v. Behrens, \n233 \nU.S. 473, 478\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1051, 1055, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 163), it is not important whether he had previously been engaged in interstate commerce, or that it was contemplated that he would be so engaged after his immediate duty had been performed. That duty was solely in connection with the removal of the coal from the storage tracks to the coal shed, or chutes, and the only ground for invoking the Federal act is that the coal thus placed was to be used by locomotives in interstate hauls.\n As we have pointed out, the Federal act speaks of interstate commerce in a practical sense suited to the occasion, and 'the true test of employment in such commerce in the sense intended is, Was the employee at the time of the injury engaged in interstate transportation, or in work so closely related to it as to be practically a part of it?' Shanks v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. \n239 \nU.S. 556, 558\n, 60 S. L. ed. 436, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 188, and cases there cited. Manifestly, there was no such close or direct relation to interstate transportation in the taking of the coal to the coal chutes. This was nothing more than the putting of the coal supply in a convenient place from which it could be taken as required for use. It has been held that an employee of the carrier, while he is mining coal in the carrier's colliery, intended to be used by its interstate locomotives, is not engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of the Federal act (Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Yurkonis, \n238 U.S. 439\n, 59 L. ed. 1397, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 902), and there is no distinction in principle between the two cases. In Great Northern R. Co. v. Knapp, \n240 U.S. 464\n, 60 L. ed. 745, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 399, the question whether the employee was engaged in interstate commerce was not presented, as the application of the Federal statute was conceded in the state court.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, R.

Turner, through the negligence, it is alleged, of the company. It was brought in the district court of Garfield county, Oklahoma, and invoked the benefits of the employers' liability act of Congress of April 22, 1908 (35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149), as amended April 5, 1910 (36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8662). The case was removed on petition of the railway company to the United States district court for the western district of Oklahoma, and remanded by that court to the state court. There an amended petition was filed by plaintiff in the action, to which an answer was filed.\n After answer the case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for the sum of $7,583, distributed in certain proportions among those dependent upon the deceased. Judgment was entered upon the verdict and sustained by the supreme court of the state.\n The case went to the jury upon the effect of certain contracts between deceased and the company, whether he was the company's servant or a contractor with it, and whether, if he was the servant of the company, it was guilty of negligence, or whether he was guilty of contributory negligence.\n The facts are not much in dispute. The company is an interstate common carrier and its line runs through the limits of the city of Enid, Garfield county, state of Oklahoma. Within the city there are six parallel tracks which run nearly from the north to the south, bearing as they proceed a little to the west. At the south end, near their termination, are located coal chutes, into the pockets or tipples of which coal is shoveled from cars set on the chutes for the use of all engines, local and interstate. The city of Enid has the power to establish and \n\n[240 U.S. 449, 451]\n\u00a0\n did establish by ordinance a speed limit of 10 miles an hour for all trains within its limits, beyond which it was unlawful to proceed.\n The relation of Turner to the railroad company was under two contracts, one dated November 1, 1910, the other October 1, 1911. In the first contract the railroad company is party of the first part and Turner party of the second part and is called 'contractor.' The covenants of one are made the consideration for the covenants of the other, and Turner, as contractor, agrees first 'to furnish all the labor required and necessary to handle; and (a) to handle all the coal required by the company at Enid, from either open or closed cars, or both, and to place the same in coal- chute pockets of the company; to gather up all coal that falls from the coal-chute pockets to the ground, and place the same on cars or engines, as desired by the company. (b) To break all coal to the size of 4-inch cubes or less before delivery to chutes for engine use, and to unload all coal for stationary boilers. (c) To unload wood from cars to storage piles located on company's right of way in Enid. (d) To load cinders from the right of way to cars at points designated by the company. (e) To unload sand from cars furnished by the company at points designated by it.\n 2d. The company agrees to pay for the services enumerated in certain designated numbers of cents per ton, or cord, or yard, as the case may be, to be paid upon estimates and records of the company.\n 3d. Contractor agrees to maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the coal chutes and break or crack all coal to suitable sizes.\n 4th. Contractor expressly assumes all liability for injuries to or death of persons in his employ, or loss or injury to his property, whether caused by the negligence of the company, its agents or employees, and he covenants to save the company harmless on account thereof, or for \n\n[240 U.S. 449, 452]\n\u00a0\n or on account of any injury to or death of any person employed by him when and while such persons may be in or about the cars, engines, and tracks of the company, 'and any injury to said contractor while performing any services under this contract which might be or have been delegated to his agent or employees.' And the contractor expressly assumes all liability for injury to or death of third persons, including the employees of the company, occasioned by any of his acts, and the company shall not be liable to him in case of his death or injury while employed in the work set forth.\n 5th. Punctuality of performance is stipulated for; (6th) the contract to continue until terminated, as it may be by either party upon fifteen days' notice; (7th) or upon failure of contractor to perform his duties, at the option of the company, without being liable in damages therefor, of which failure the company shall be the sole judge; (8th) the company to furnish the necessary tools for the performance of the stipulated services.\n 9th. It is 'agreed and understood that the contractor shall be deemed and held as the original contractor, and the railway company reserves and holds no control over him in the doing of such work other than as to the results to be accomplished.'\n 10th. The company shall keep a record of all coal delivered, and shall make settlements and pay the contractor for handling the coal upon the basis of such handling, and the contractor shall make daily reports of the cars unloaded by him, and shall receive, collect, and deliver to the duly authorized representative of the company a ticket from each engineman, hostler, or other employee, showing the number of tons of coal delivered to any engine; (11th) payment of the work to be made monthly; and (12th) the contract and all the terms and conditions, rights and obligations thereof, to inure to the heirs, administrators, executors, legal representatives, \n\n[240 U.S. 449, 453]\n\u00a0\n assigns, and lessees of both parties, but assigning or subletting shall not be without the written consent of the company.\n Under the other contract Turner was required to cooper all cars which the roundhouse foreman directed him to prepare to fit the cars to hold grain in transit, the foreman to be the sole judge whether the preparation was in accordance with the contract. The manner of preparation is detailed and the price to be paid therefor in cents, the company to furnish the materials.\n There are provisions as in the other contract to save the company from liability to persons or property. The contract was to continue until terminated upon thirty days' notice.\n This contract is pertinent only for illustration, and otherwise may be put out of view. The deceased was killed, it is the contention, while performing services under the first contract.\n Turner had a contract with the Enid Mill & Elevator Company to unload coal, and, directly after 4 o'clock on the day he was killed, having finished a particular service at which he and one of his employees had been engaged, remarked that he would 'go down and gather up the tickets and order a car of coal for the morning,' and started down the tracks toward the chutes.\n He next appeared about 5:25 o'clock at the cinder pile of the Enid Mill & Elevator Company at what is designated as the 'White Mill,' and there had a conversation with an employee of that company, and asked him, the employee, if he thought he would have enough coal for the boiler room to run until Monday night. While they were talking a passenger train signaled its approach to the station and Turner said,\n'That is 24; I must take my coal tickets to the freight house and turn them in and order coal for the chutes.' He then started towards the freight house. \n\n[240 U.S. 449, 454]\n\u00a0\n The trial court thought the testimony was indefinite of Turner's intention and hesitated to decide that he was engaged in services to the railway company rather than to the Enid Mill & Elevator Company, but finally left it to the jury to decide.\n\n From the 'White Mill' Turner passed along the tracks of the railroad and was seen by a witness walking between tracks 3 and 4 with his hands behind him, and while so walking, and when he was at a point east of the north end of the freight house, an engine and two box cars and a flat car, backing on the track to his left in the direction in which he was going, and running at about 25 miles an hour, and in excess of the speed limit prescribed in the ordinance, ran over and killed him. It is a reasonable conjecture that the character of the day and the noise and confusion of the approaching passenger train so distracted his attention that he did not hear the approach of the backing cars and warning yells of the brakeman, and apprehended no danger.\n Besides excessive speed there were other elements of negligence by the company which the plaintiff relied upon.\n We may pass by the assignments of error based on the rulings upon the evidence and in giving and refusing instructions. The determining consideration is the relation in which Turner stood to the company, whether he was an employee of it or an independent contractor.\n The trial court submitted the question to the decision of the jury; the supreme court, considering the contract of November 1, 1910, hereinbefore set out, and certain testimony, decided that Turner was an employee of the company. The court said: 'Not only did the contract reserve to the company the right to control and direct deceased in his work, but it might be well to know, although we are only passing on the face of the contract, that the company, pursuant to the power therein reserved, did that very thing, which confirms us in our opinion, gathered \n\n[240 U.S. 449, 455]\n\u00a0\n from the face of the contract, that the same was not capable of execution without such direction and control. Such amounts to a practical construction of the contract by the company. Mr. Bowman, station agent and yardmaster of defendant, testified:\n\"Q. From whom did Turner get instructions about handling work performed by him?\n\n\"A. Under his contract from us.\n\n\"Q. You directed him what to do?\n\n\"A. Yes, either me or my chief clerk.\n\n\"Q. So that he was under your supervision and control all the time?\n\n\"A. In so far as his contracts were concerned, yes, sir.\n\n\"Q. He performed his duties in accordance with what you directed him to do?\n\n\"A. Yes, sir.\n\n\"Q. I will ask you if all this coal he handled for the chutes, if that was Rock Island coal?\n\n\"A. Yes, sir.\" [-- Okla. --, 148 Pac. 107.]\n\n To which testimony this must be added:\n\"Q. Did you have anything to do with directing him in detail as to how he performed the terms of his contract?\n\n\"A. No, sir.\"\n\n We are unable to concur with the learned court in its conclusion. There was, it is true, and necessarily, a certain direction to be given by the company, or rather, we should say, information given to Turner. But the manner of the work was under his control, to be done by him and those employed by him. He was responsible for its faithful performance and incurred the penalty of the instant termination of the contract for nonperformance. This was only a prudent precaution, indeed, necessary in view of the purpose of his contract, which was to make provision for a daily supply of coal for the operation of the railroad. The power given was one of control in a sense, but it was not a detailed control of the actions of Turner or those of \n\n[240 U.S. 449, 456]\n\u00a0\n his employees. It was a judgment only over results and a necessary sanction of the obligations which he had incurred. It was not tantamount to the control of an employee and a remedy against his incompetency or neglect.\n The whole instrument shows system and particular care. It is not the engagement of a servant submitting to subordination and subject momentarily to superintendence, but of one capable of independent action, to be judged of by its results. And the covenants were suitable for the purpose, only consistent with it, not consistent with a temporary employment. This is manifest from the provision for payment, from the careful assignment of liabilities, and the explicit provision that Turner 'shall be deemed and held as the original contractor, and the railroad company reserves and holds no control over him in the doing of such work other than as to the results to be accomplished.'\n The railroad company, therefore, did not retain the right to direct the manner in which the business should be done, as well as the results to be accomplished, or, in other words, did not retain control not only of what should be done, but how it should be done.

[35 Stat. at L. 66, chap. 149, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8661.]\n Turner was something more than a mere shoveler of coal under a superior's command. He was an independent employer of labor, conscious of his own power to direct \n\n[240 U.S. 449, 457]\n\u00a0\n and willing to assume the responsibility of direction and to be judged bt its results. This is manifest from the contract under review and from the cooperage contract; it is also manifest from his contracts with the other companies to whose industries the railroad company's tracks extended. We certainly cannot say that he was incompetent to assume such relation and incur its consequences.\n Thus, being of opinion that Turner was not an employee of the company, but an independent contractor, it is not material to consider whether the services in which he was engaged were in interstate commerce.\n Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, R.I. & P. RY. CO. v. WRIGHT(1916)\nNo. 167\nArgued: November 30, 1915Decided: January 10, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. E. P. Holmes and Paul E. Walker for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. George W. Berge and Halleck F. Rose for defendants in error. \n\n[239 U.S. 548, 549]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action against a railroad company by personal representatives to recover for the death of their intestate, an employee of the company, resulting from a collision of two locomotives on the company's railroad at Lincoln, Nebraksa. One of the locomotives was a switch engine returning to the city from an adjacent transfer track, and the other a road engine on the way to a distant repair shop. The former was in charge of a switching crew, and the latter of an engine crew in which the intestate was the engineer. At the place of the collision the track is in a deep and curved cut which shortens the view along the track. The causal negligence set up in the petition included allegations that the defendant negligently failed to provide a suitable rule regulating the speed and movement of switch engines through the cut; that the switch engine was being run through the cut at a negligent, reckless, and dangerous rate of speed, and without its engineer having it under control, and that when the employees in charge of it came within view of the other engine they negligently jumped to the ground without reversing their engine or attempting to stop it, notwithstanding it reasonably and safely could have been stopped in time to prevent the collision. The answer denied all that was alleged in the petition, and charged the intestate with gross contributory negligence and an assumption of the risk. The petition described the road engine as moving from one point to another in Nebraska, and said nothing about interstate commerce, but the answer alleged that this engine was being taken to a point in another state, and that the defendant was engaged and the intestate was employed in interstate commerce. At the trial the evidence disclosed that the defendant was operating a railroad extending through Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and other \n\n[239 U.S. 548, 550]\n\u00a0\n states; that the road engine was on the way from Phillipsburg, Kansas, to Council Bluffs, Iowa; that the train order under which the intestate was proceeding at the time read, 'Engine 1486 will run extra Fairbury to Albright,' both points being in Nebraska, and that when Albright was reached another order was to be given, covering the remainder of the trip. Notwithstanding the allegation in the answer and this evidence, the court submitted the case to the jury, as if it were controlled by the employers' liability act of Nebraska, and not by the act of Congress. The plaintiff had a verdict and judgment, and the latter was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 94 Neb. 317, 143 N. W. 220, 96 Neb. 87, 146 N. W. 1024. The defendant prosecutes this writ of error.\n It is entirely clear that taking the road engine from Phillipsburg, Kansas, to Council Bluffs, Iowa, was an act of interstate commerce, and that the intestate, while participating in that act, was employed in such commerce. That the engine was not in commercial use, but merely on the way to a repair shop, is immaterial. It was being taken from one state to another, and this was the true test of whether it was moving in interstate commerce. See North Carolina R. Co. v. Zachary, \n232 \nU.S. 248, 259\n, 58 S. L. ed. 591, 595, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 159. The courts of the state rested their decision to the contrary upon the train order under which the intestate was proceeding, and upon the decisions in Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. United States, 21 L.R.A.(N.S.) 690, 93 C. C. A. 450, 168 Fed. 236, and United States v. Rio Grande Western R. Co. 98 C. C. A. 293, 174 Fed. 399. In this they misconceived the meaning of the trian order and the effect of the decisions cited. The order was given by a division train despatcher, and meant that between the points named therein the engine would have the status of an extra train, and not that it was going merely from one of those points to the other. The cases cited arose under the safety appliance acts of Congress, and what was decided was that those acts were not in- \n\n[239 U.S. 548, 551]\n\u00a0\n tended to penalize a carrier for hauling to an adjacent and convenient place of repair a car with defective appliances, when the sole purpose of the movement was to have the defect corrected, and the car was hauled alone, and not in connection with other cars in commercial use. It was not held or suggested that such a hauling from one state to another was not a movement in interstate commerce, but only that it was not penalized by those acts.\n As the injuries resulting in the intestate's death were sustained while the company was engaged, and while he was employed by it, in interstate commerce, the company's responsibility was governed by the employers' liability act of Congress, chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 143, 36 Stat. at L. 291, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8662; and as that act is exclusive and supersedes state laws upon the subject, it was error to submit the case to the jury as if the state act were controlling. Wabash R. Co. v. Hayes, \n234 \nU.S. 86, 89\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1226, 1230, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 729, 6 N. C. C. A. 224, and cases cited.\n But error affords no ground for reversal where it is not prejudicial, and here it is plain that the company was not prejudiced. While there are several differences between the state act and the act of Congress, the only difference having a present bearing is one relating to contributory negligence. The state act declares that in cases where the employee's negligence is slight and that of the employer is gross in comparison, the former's negligence shall not bar a recovery, but shall operate to diminish the damages proportionally. In other cases contributory negligence remains a bar as at common law. Comp. Stat. 1907,  2803b; Cobbey's Anno. Stat. 1911,  10,592. The act of Congress, on the other hand, declares that the employee's negligence shall not bar a recovery in any case, but shall operate to diminish the damages proportionally in all cases, save those of a designated class, of which this is not one. Thus, it will be seen that the state act is more favorable to the employer than is the act of Congress. The instructions to the jury followed the state \n\n[239 U.S. 548, 552]\n\u00a0\n act, and consequently were more favorable to the company than they would have been had they followed the act of Congress. To illustrate: under the instruction given, a finding that the intestate's injuries were caused by concurring negligence of the company and himself, and that his negligence was more than slight and the company's less than gross, must have resulted in a verdict for the company, while, under instructions following the act of Congress, such a finding must have resulted in a verdict for the plaintiffs, with the damages proportionally diminished. Of course, no prejudice could have resulted to the company from the instructions being more favorable to it than they should have been under the controlling law.\n The company requested a directed verdict in its favor on the ground that there was no evidence of any negligence whereon it could be held responsible for the intestate's death, but the request was denied, and the supreme court of the state sustained the ruling. In this it is contended that the company was denied a Federal right; that is, the right to be shielded from responsibility under the act of Congress when an essential element of such responsibility is entirely wanting. See St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. McWhirter, \n229 \nU.S. 265, 275\n, 277 S., 57 L. ed. 1179, 1185, 1186, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 858; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Padgett, \n236 \nU.S. 668, 673\n, 59 S. L. ed. 777, 781, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 481. The collision was on the main track and within the outer portion of the yard limits at Lincoln. At that point the track was in a deep and curved cut which made the view along the track from an engine passing in either direction comparatively short. The intestate was proceeding to a distant point under an order which gave his engine the status of an extra train, and the switching crew were returning to the city with their engine after completing some switching work at an adjacent transfer track. The switching crew knew the extra was in the yard and that they might meet it while going through the cut, for the engineer in that crew testified:\n Q. What did he [the fire- \n\n[239 U.S. 548, 553]\n\u00a0\n man] say?\n A. He says: 'Here they are,' or 'there they are,' or something like that.\n Q. You knew who 'they' was, what 'they' referred to, you knew it was this extra?\n A. I thought it was.\n Q. Yes, you was expecting it?\n A. I was expecting it in a way. Yes, I was told to look out for it, which we were doing.\n Q. You knew it was likely to come aroung that curve?\n A. Yes, sir.\n And yet the switching crew were proceeding through the cut at so high a speed that they were unable to stop their engine and avoid a collision notwithstanding the extra was 420 feet away when it came within view and was brought practically to a stop within 50 feet. Among the company's rules were the following: 'All except first-class trains will approach, enter, and pass through the following named yards [among them being the yard at Lincoln] under full control, excepting to find the main track occupied or obstructed.' 'Yard limits will be indicated by yard-limit boards. Within these yard limits engines may occupy main tracks, protecting themselves against overdue trains. Extra trains must protect themselves within yard limits.' The intestate's engine was neither a first- class nor an overdue train, but, as before stated, had the status of an extra train. The company took the position that the rules placed upon the intestate the entire burden of taking the requisite precautions to avoid a collision with the switch engine at any place within the yard limits, whether in the cut or elsewhere, and therefore that no negligence could be imputed to the company or the switching crew in respect of the speed or control of the switch engine. This position was pointedly illustrated by the foreman of the switching crew, who testified:\n Q. But you went on the theory and assumed that everything had to get out of the way for you except this passenger [a first-class train soon to pass through the cut]?\n A. Yes, sir.\n Q. Although you knew the extra was in the yards?\n A. Yes, sir.\n Q. And you claim it under that rule? \n\n[239 U.S. 548, 554]\n\u00a0\n A. Yes, sir. . . . Q. You ought to run under control, though, in the yard limits? A. Why, I don't see why? Q. How? A. Other trains are supposed to look out for us. . . . Q. What is the rule about switch engines running under control in the yard limits? A. There is not any. Q. How? A. There is no rule. And that position was also illustrated by the division train master, who stated that 'switch engines had the right over all except first-class trains in the yards, and other trains would have to look out for them,' and further testified: Q. When you say you examine men for switch engines do you use these rules? A. Yes, and the time-tables. Q. You tell switch engine men that they have a right to run 25 miles an hour in the yards? A. Yes, sir. Q. You tell them that? A. If they want to. I don't tell them anything about running. Q. How is that? A. I don't tell them anything about how fast they shall run or how slow. Q. You understand, of course, that they can at any time run their engines negligently? A. I understand that, yes. Q. You don't tell them to be careful at all when you instruct your switch engine men? A. I tell them to run their engines according to the rules. Q. But you have no rules respecting switch engines? A. No, we have instructions sometimes. Q. Have you any rules respecting switch engines? A. No, sir. . . . Q. What do you tell your switch engine men about your rules, about running under control in yard limits? A. Don't tell them anything, not in regard to running under control in the yards.\n The plaintiffs took the position that the rules, if regarded as devolving upon one in the intestate's situation the measure of responsibility indicated, and permitting the switching crew to run their engine through the cut, not under control, but at high speed, when they knew that they might meet the other engine, were unreasonable in that respect. Whether the rules were thus unreasonable was submitted to the jury as a question of \n\n[239 U.S. 548, 555]\n\u00a0\n fact over the company's objection that the question was one of law for the court. The jury found, as the record plainly shows, that the rules were unreasonable, and that the switch engine was negligently run at greater speed than was reasonable in the circumstances. Dealing with these subjects, the supreme court of the state said (96 Neb. 87, 146 N. W. 1024): 'The decedent was running his engine under full control, within the meaning of the rule of the company. There was no express rule as to the speed allowed to the switch engine. Of course, the law requires that such engine should not be run at an unreasonable rate of speed under the circumstances. The engineer of the switch engine must have had a clear view of the approaching engine for at least 420 feet, and it was run at least 370 feet of this distance before the collision occurred. It could have been stopped within a distance of 60 feet unless running at a greater speed than 20 miles an hour; and, knowing, as the crew of the switch engine did, that No. 1486 [the extra] was in the yards, to run at a greater speed than 20 miles an hour in such a locality and under such circumstances was in itself negligence. In such a case the court might properly have told the jury that any rule of the company which permitted such action was unreasonable, and the giving of an erroneous instruction as to the reasonableness of the rules would be without prejudice to the defendant.'\n While doubting that the rules, rightly understood, permitted the switching crew to proceed at a speed which obviously endangered the safety of the extra, which they knew might be coming through the cut on the same track, we agree that if this was permitted by the rules, they were in that respect unreasonable and void. And in either case, we think it is manifest that there was ample evidence of negligence whereon the company could be held responsible under the act of Congress.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, T.H. & S.E.

Hutchins for plaintiff in error.\n No appearance for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n A statute of Indiana provides as follows:\n'Sec. 1. . . . That all railroad corporations doing \n\n[242 U.S. 283, 284]\n\u00a0\n business in this state shall, between the 1st day of July and the 20th day of August, in each year, cause all thistles, burs, docks, and other noxious weeds growing on lands occupied by them in any city, village or township of this state, to be cut down and destroyed.\n\n'Sec. 2. In case any railroad company shall refuse or neglect to comply with the requirements specified in the first section of this act, such company shall be liable in a penalty of $25 to be prosecuted for in an action of debt by any person feeling himself aggrieved. Said suit may be brought before any justice of the peace in the county, who shall require of the complainant surety to pay costs in case he fails to maintain his action. Summons may be served on any agent or officer of the company.' [Burns's Anno. Stat. 1914,  5524, 5525.]\n\n The company was proceeded against under this statute by defendant in error, who alleged that the railroad company is a corporation doing business in the state, and that one of the branches of its railway lines intersects and runs through his land for a distance of 1\/4 of a mile in the township of Curry, Sullivan county, Indiana, and that the company, between July 1, 1911, and August 20, 1911, refused and neglected to cause all noxious weeds (following the words of the statute) growing on lands occupied by it in the township and county designated above to be cut down and destroyed, and especially on its lands running through the lands of defendant in error. He also alleged that he felt himself aggrieved thereby and had been damaged in the sum of $25, and should receive the statutory penalty of $25.\n The company demurred to the complaint for insufficiency to constitute a cause of action, filing therewith a memorandum alleging, among other things, that the act was unconstitutional.\n The demurrer was overruled and the company filed a general denial of the allegations of the complaint. \n\n[242 U.S. 283, 285]\n\u00a0\n After hearing a penalty was imposed upon the company in the sum of $ 25. It filed a motion in arrest of judgment in which it repeated that the law was unconstitutional. The motion was overruled and Judgment entered against the company. It was affirmed by the supreme court. In that court the ground was specifically urged that the statute offended the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The court considered both contentions and rejected both, and to review its decision this writ of error is prosecuted.\n As offending against the equal protection assured by the 14th Amendment the company complains that occupiers of land are separated into two classes-'(1) railway corporations, and (2) all others.' This, it is insisted, is an unnatural and unjustifiable classification with respect to the obligation imposed of cutting down weeds growing on lands occupied, as there is no relation between the line of division of the classes and the subject matter. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150\n, 41 L. ed. 666, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255, and Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 U.S. 540\n, 46 L. ed. 679, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431, are cited. We need not pause to review them or the many cases decided since them, explaining the wide discretion a legislature has in the classification of the objects of legislation, for immediately repellent to plaintiff in error's contention is Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. May, \n194 U.S. 267\n, 48 L. ed. 971, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638. In that case a statute of Texas imposed a penalty on railroad companies for permitting Johnson grass and Russian thistle to go to seed upon their rights of way. A right of action for the penalty was given to contiguous owners. The act was sustained, but certain distinctions between that statute and the Indiana statute are pointed out. These distinctions are: (1) The Texas statute gave the penalty to dontiguous landowners; the Indiana statute gives it to 'any person feeling himself aggrieved.' (2) The Texas statute required the con- \n\n[242 U.S. 283, 286]\n\u00a0\n tiguous landowner to be free from the same neglect; the Indiana statute does not impose this limitation. (3) The Texas statute is limited to the railroad's rights of way; the Indiana statute applies to all lands occupied by a railroad 'in any city, village or township.'\n How discriminating and arbitrary these distinctions make the Indiana statute as compared with the Texas statute, and remove the latter from authority, is variously illustrated by plaintiff in error.\n The supreme court of Indiana is not specific as to these contentions. On the authority of Pennsylvania Co. v. State, 142 Ind. 428, 41 N. E. 937, and Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Ferguson, 157 Ind. 37, 60 N. E. 679, the court decided that it was neither necessary to aver in the complaint nor prove that the person bringing the action had suffered actual damages. The court said: 'The penalty imposed is for violation of a duty required of appellant [the railway company] and it is not in a position to complain that the penalty when collected shall be paid to the complaining party, and this is not available in defense of an action for the recovery of the penalty prescribed.' [182 Ind. 144, 105 N. E. 49.]\n In Pennsylvania Co. v. State the penalty was imposed for failure of railroads to provide blackboards in their passenger stations showing the time of arrival and departure of trains, the act providing that one half of the recovery should go to the prosecuting attorney. It was held that this was a method of compensating that officer and to encourage the actual enforcement of the law against its violators, and not intended to require him to become a party litigant.\n In the second case a statute was considered that required telegrams to be transmitted with impartiality and in the order of time in which they were received, and without discrimination as to rates. It was provided that any person or company violating the act should be liable to 'any party aggrieved in a penalty of $100 for each \n\n[242 U.S. 283, 287]\n\u00a0\n offense, to be recovered in a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction.' It was held that the 'party aggrieved is the person whose message the telegraph company has refused to receive or failed to transmit on the terms or in the manner prescribed by the statute,' and that it was not necessary for him to show that he had sustained any actual damages; that he might recover compensation for damages independently of the statute, which furnished a cumulative remedy.\n Both cases illustrate the principle that a penalty imposed by a statute may be given to an informer or prosecutor as a means of enforcing the statute,-as a means of its public vindication,-and necessarily there could be but one recovery in the designated territory. But we cannot say whom, under the statute under review in this case, the court would consider a 'party aggrieved,' or who could be considered as a 'person feeling himself aggrieved,' to use the language of the statute, whether a contiguous landowner, or other landowner, or whether any person could be aggrieved within the meaning of the statute if he himself was guilty of the same neglect as the railroad company. Nor can we say how the supreme court would decide as to what was meant by 'lands occupied by' railroad corporations; whether this would mean only their rights of way, the designation of 'in any city, village or township' being only for the purpose of venue, or mean, which is difficult to suppose, the corporation's 'roundhouses, shops, yards, repair tracks, turntables, and other buildings used in connection' with the business of a railroad, which seems to be the alarm of plaintiff in error. At any rate, such construction has not yet been given and may never be given, and we cannot anticipate that it ever will be given, and on that anticipation hold the statute invalid. We have heretofore expressed the propriety of waiting, when a state statute is attacked for unconstitutionality, until the \n\n[242 U.S. 283, 288]\n\u00a0\n state court has given it a construction which may justify the attack. Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 546\n, 58 S. L. ed. 713, 720, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 359. The statute has only been applied in favor of a contiguous land-holder, and only one recovery has been permitted. So limited, we think its validity must be admitted under the doctrine of the May Case. But we express no opinion concerning the consequences if a broader construction should be accepted by the state court.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Burns' Ann.

Richardson for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Wallace for appellee. \n\n[241 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Appeal from a judgment dismissing a petition for habeas corpus and remanding petitioner to the custody of the Commissioner of Immigration for the Port of San Francisco, in whose custody he was, pending petitioner's deportation.\n A summary of the petition made by the district court is as follows:\n'Petitioner Chin Fong, who had been a resident of the United States for a number of years, departed for China in November, 1912; that before he left he applied for a pre-investigation as to his status as a merchant, and a certificate was denied him on the ground that his original entry into this country was surreptitious; that notwithstanding this denial the petitioner left the country, and is now endeavoring to beenter as a returning Chinese merchant; that he presents the affidavits of a member of the New York firm to which he claims to belong and of two reputable Americans supporting his claim; that notwithstanding these facts he has been denied admission and ordered deported on the same ground that his pre- investigation certificate was denied, that is to say, because his original entry was surreptitious; that in so deciding the immigration department has exceeded its authority, as that question can only be determined under the exclusion laws by a justice, judge, or commissioner.' [213 Fed. 288.]\n\n A demurrer was interposed to the petition, which was sustained, the court saying: 'Had the petitioner been content to remain in this country, he could have been deported only after a hearing before a justice, judge, or commissioner. But as he left the country voluntarily, and even after a preinvestigation certificate was denied him, the question of his right to re-entry lies peculiarly with the immigration department, and as they have found \n\n[241 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n that he is not entitled to re-enter, such finding cannot be disturbed. A different rule prevails, and a different tribunal determines, in the case of a Chinese applying to enter, from that of one already in this country whom it is sought to deport, under the exclusion laws.'\n The decision of the court is contested and it is asserted (1) that the petition was sufficient to entitle petitioner to a discharge; (2) that the Commissioner of Immigration and Secretary of Labor could not require a greater and different degree of proof than that specified in  2 of the act of Congress of May 5, 1892, entitled, 'An Act to Prohibit the Coming of Chinese Persons into the United States' [27 Stat. at L. 25, chap. 60, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4315]; (3) that petitioner furnished the degree of proof required by the law; (4) that the rights guaranteed petitioner under the treaty between the United States and China concerning immigration, November 17, 1880 [22 Stat. at L. 826], were unduly and unlawfully infringed; and (5) that the decision of the Commissioner was against the law and was an abuse of discretion.\n The appeal is direct from the district court, and can only be sustained against the motion of the United States to dismiss for want of jurisdiction in this court if there is a substantial question under the Constitution of the United States or a treaty made under their authority,  238 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913 ,  1215] permitting an appeal from a district court when a constitutional question is involved and in any case 'in which . . . the validity or construction of any treaty made under its [United States] authority is drawn in question.'\n It will be observed that appellant based his right to land solely on the ground that he had been a merchant in the United States before his departure to China, and that, therefore, it was not competent for the immigration officers to inquire or determine whether his original entry into the United States was open or surreptitious and his stay therein legal or illegal. 'The principal proposition that \n\n[241 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n we desire to maintain,' counsel say, 'and which has apparently been ignored by the Department of Labor, is that when Congress has definitely fixed the tests and qualifications attendant upon the determination of a given act, it is not within the power of an administrative officer to add to or subtract from the congressional rule.' The case of Lau Ow Bew v. United States, \n144 U.S. 47\n, 36 L. ed. 340, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 517, is cited.

Stat. 1913,  4324), which reads as follows:\n'Where an application is made by a Chinaman for entrance into the United States on the ground that he was formerly engaged in this country as a merchant, he shall establish by the testimony of two credible witnesses other than Chinese the fact that he conducted such business as hereinbefore defined for at least one year before his departure from the United States, and that during such year he was not engaged in the performance of any manual labor, except such as was necessary in the conduct of his business as such merchant, and in default of such proof shall be refused landing.'\n\n It is contended that the section requires proof by a Chinaman seeking entrance into the United States of two facts only-(1) that he had been a merchant for one year before his departure, and (2) that during such time he had not engaged in manual labor except such as was necessary in the conduct of his business as such merchant. These were the only conditions of the right to enter, it is contended, and it was an irrelevant inquiry whether he 'originally entered as a laborer or even surreptitiously.' And in emphasis counsel say: 'The manner of entry was entirely ignored by Congress.'\n These being the conditions, it is hence asserted that if the Department of Labor may superadd one qualification, it may another, 'until the law becomes entirely unrecognizable.' So far manifestly there is nothing but an appeal to the statute, but the treaty is attempted to be invoked \n\n[241 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n by the following: 'Such a course [the addition to the qualifications of the statute] would be in plain derogation of the treaty obligations between the United States and China, allowing to Chinese merchants freedom of egress and ingress in the manner permitted to citizens of the most favored nations, the essential fact by law and treaty being merely that of mercantile status.'\n No provision of the treaty is cited from which the contention is an applicable deduction, nor are we disposed to quote and comment on the entire treaty in answer to the contention. See 22 Stat. at L. 826; also Lau Ow Bew v. United States, supra. The 'merchant' defined by it does not include petitioner. It was the definition of the status acquired in China, not acquired in the United States, and, having been acquired in China, gave access to the United States, and after access freedom of movement as citizens of the most favored nations. And this privilege was given as well to Chinese laborers then (1880) in the United States. could acquire by either a status which the merit in the contention that the case involves the construction of a treaty, and that the rights of petitioner can rest only upon the statutes regulating Chinese immigration. So concluding, we are not called upon to decide or express opinion whether petitioner's original entry into the United States and his subsequent residence therein were illegal, and whether he could acquire by eitherr a status which the immigration officers were without power to disregard.\n Dismissed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 (Comp.

RANKIN(1916)\nNo. 59\nArgued: November 5, 1915Decided: May 22, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 319, 320]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James J. Lynch, Michael M. Allison, Isaac G. Phillips, and Edward Colston for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. W. B. Miller and Charles C. Fox for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n Defendants in error, experienced shippers, on November 6, 1911, delivered to plaintiff railway at Danville, Kentucky, a car of mules, nineteen of which they owned, for transportation to Atlanta, Georgia. They signed and accepted a through bill of lading, the pertinent portions of which follow:\n Contract for limited liability in the trans portation of live stock at reduced rates.\n\n 3. \nLimit of value.-That this agreement is subject to the following terms and conditions, which the said shipper accepts as just and reasonable, and which he admits having read and having had explained to him by the agent of the said carrier, viz.:\n That the published freight rates on live stock of said carrier are, in all cases, based on the following maximum calculations, which are as high as the profit in the freight rates will admit of the carrier assuming responsibility for:\n ... * *\n Horses or mules, not exceeding $75 each\n ... * *\n That the tariff regulations of said carrier provide that for every increase of 100 per cent, or fraction thereof, in the above valuations, there shall be an increase of 50 per cent in the freight rate; and that the said shipper, in order to avail himself of said published freight rates, agrees that said carrier shall not, in any case of loss \n\n[241 U.S. 319, 321]\n\u00a0\n or damage to said live stock, be liable for any sum in excess of the actual value of said stock at the place and date of shipment, nor for any amount in excess of the values stated above, which are hereby agreed to be not less than the just and true values of the animals, unless an additional amount is herein stated and paid for.\n\n 4. \nGuaranteed freight rate.-That the rate of freight guaranteed by said carrier, in view of the above stipulated valuations is $_____ per _____ from _____ _____ to _____ _____ and that said shipper accepts this rate of freight, and agrees to pay same at destination in connection with the charges advanced by said carrier, as indicated above, and any other legitimate charges which said carrier may advance for account of said shipper between point of shipment and destination for feed, water, etc.\n A wreck occurred at Dayton, Tennessee; some of the animals were killed; others were injured and afterwards sold by plaintiff in error; and shippers brought this suit in the circuit court, Hamilton county, Tennessee, to recover $4,750,-$250 per head.\n The declaration contains two counts. The first-a common-law count on a general contract of affreightment-alleges delivery with agreement to pay full freight charges and that the carrier accepted and agreed to transport safely, but failed so to do. The second sets up execution and delivery of the bill of lading annexed as an exhibit, but declares shippers knew nothing of the limited-liability provision therein; and further 'that the whole of said paper, and especially the $75 limitation, is void and of no effect and is not operative or binding on them or either of them,' because ( 1) executed in Kentucky, under whose laws it is void; (2) unreasonable and unjust; (3) no other contract of transportation was offered, and shippers were not aware that the transportation was to take place at reduced rates and under stipulations for limited liability; (4) there was no consideration; (5) the \n\n[241 U.S. 319, 322]\n\u00a0\n parties were not on equal terms. It also denounces as untrue statements in clause 3 of the bill concerning published freight rates and tariff regulations.\n The railway filed nine pleas; two general-'not guilty' and 'that it did not breach the contract of carriage' as alleged-and seven special ones. Among other things, the company avers in the latter: That it had duly filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and had published and kept open for inspection schedules of joint rates between Danville, Kentucky, and Atlanta; they contained classifications of freight in force, and stated separately all terminal and other charges, and provided that carload rates upon horses and mules, where valued not above $75 each, should be $95 per car, and for every increase of 100 per cent or fraction thereof there should be an increase of 50 per cent in rate; plaintiffs knew the company's freight rate was based upon specified values and that it stood ready to transport at increased valuation and rate, and, knowing these facts, they declared the value specified, and thereby obtained the cheaper rate of $95 per car. That the receipt or bill of lading duly signed by shippers fixes a maximum value; contains definite recitals (set out above) in respect of rates, etc., and 'with all the provisions thereof, is valid and binding upon the plaintiffs and the defendant when applied to interstate shipments which are governed by the acts of Congress of February 4, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104), and June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563), and defendant pleads and relies upon the same as a complete bar to any recovery (in excess of $75) for such mules as were actually killed and such ones as were actually damaged to the amount of $75.'\n Issue being joined, the cause was tried to a jury. D. F. Rankin, testifying for himself, declared the mules were worth from $230 to $240 each; described the circumstances surrounding shipment, identified exhibited bill of lading as signed and accepted by him, but stated he did not read \n\n[241 U.S. 319, 323]\n\u00a0\n it, and nothing was said about rates, and that he was not aware of the $75 limitation; admitted he had shipped stock over same route before, paying $ 95 per car; and asserted he had seen no printed tariff rates from Danville to Atlanta. The bill so identified was treated throughout the trial as properly in evidence; but no duly filed and applicable rate schedules were presented, nor did the railway introduce any evidence to support its special pleas.\n The trial judge held:\n'The one controlling point in this case is as to whether or not there is a presumption in favor of the defendant's compliance with the law whereby it seeks by its action to escape from liability.'\n\n'There is no doubt in the mind of the court but that if the railroad were charged with a violation of the provisions of the interstate commerce act, a presumption in favor of its compliance would arise; but where the railroad, as in this case, sets up, as a matter of defense, its compliance with the provisions of that act, the court is of the opinion that there is no presumption in its favor, and that the burden of proof is on the defendant to show a substantial compliance with the provisions of the act.'\n\n'It therefore follows that under the facts in this case, the undisputed facts and the decisions of our courts on this subject, that the court is of the opinion that the contract in this case is invalid, and the question goes to the jury as to the negligence of the defendant on this shipment of stock.' And he charged the jury:\n\n'If you find from the proof in this case that the plaintiff did deliver in good condition nineteen mules to the defendant to be transported to Atlanta, Georgia, and that there was an accident, a collision on the railroad, then the burden is upon the railway company to show that it has not been guilty of any negligence. \n\n[241 U.S. 319, 324]\n\u00a0\n 'If the defendant company shows you by the greater weight or the preponderance of the evidence its freedom from negligence, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\n\n'If you reach the conclusion that the plaintiff has made out his case and is entitled to recover for the value of the nineteen mules, then he would be entitled to recover the value of the mules at the place of their destination, in this case, Atlanta, Georgia, according to their value at the time they would have been delivered but for the negligence of the carrier, less whatever transportation charges there would have been on this car of stock.\n\n'It is also in the discretion of the jury to award interest on any recovery from the time of the loss up to the present time.' . . . 'Negligence is the want or lack of exercise of that degree of care which the particular circumstances demands. In this case the carrier is held to the highest degree of care for the safe transportation of the animals.'\n\n Judgment upon a verdict for $4,180-$220 per head-and $328.82 interest was affirmed by the court of civil appeals, and the supreme court approved this action without opinion.\n The court of civil appeals inter alia declared:\n'It hardly appears debatable to us, that it was incumbent upon the railroad company, in this case, in the present state of the pleadings, to show by proof that it had met the requirements of the interstate commerce act, and this burden it failed to carry, and having failed to do so, it cannot rely upon presumption.\n\n'Having reached this conclusion, it remains to be determined what are the rights and liabilities of these parties, under the contract of carriage in this case. There being nothing in the record to show that the rate of freight charged by the company was approved and authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission, we must determine the rights of these parties upon the theory that no \n\n[241 U.S. 319, 325]\n\u00a0\n such rate was ever filed with the Commission, or approved or authorized by it, and that the rate and contract made in this case was without the authority and outside of the act of Congress, invoked by this defendant; or, in other words, so far as the interstate commerce act is concerned, this railroad company has made the contract in violation of its provisions . . . .\n\n'There is no proof that the railroad company had any other rate than the one charged plaintiffs for this shipment between Danville, Kentucky, and Atlanta, Georgia. There is no proof that it offered to plaintiffs, at the time it issued to them its bill of lading, a contract with unlimited liability, or, in other words, a common-law liability. . . .\n\n'. . . If the company had any other rate than the one it agreed for the transportation of this freight, it did not disclose that fact to the shipper, nor did it have any rate whatever posted in or about its office. If it had a shipping contract with unlimited liability it did not choose between the two, and, from the undisputed facts developed in this record, it is clear to our minds this contract is void and the limited-liability clause therein cannot be relied upon by the company as a bar to the recovery of full value of each animal shipped. If, however, the defendant had shown, by proof, that the rate charged by it for this freight had been filed with and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and that it had posted the rate, as required by the act of Congress, then a rate of freight based upon the valuation fixed in the bill of lading would have limited plaintiffs' right to recover to the value fixed in the contract.'\n\n Plaintiff in error maintains, first, that, not having been negligent, it is not liable for any sum; and, second, that in any event it is protected by a valid limitation in the bill of lading.\n Counsel concede liability of a common carrier under the long- recognized common-law rule not only for negligence, \n\n[241 U.S. 319, 326]\n\u00a0\n but also as an insurer, and that unless the Carmack amendment (copied in margin)1 has changed this rule, the railway is responsible for damages not exceeding specified value. But they insist that in Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 57 L. ed. 314, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148, we held this amendment restricts a carrier's liability to loss 'caused by it.' And, consequently, they say, the trial court erred when it charged: 'In this case the carrier is held to the highest degree of care for the safe transportation of the animals.'\n Construing the Carmack amendment, we said through Mr. Justice Lurton in the case cited (pp. 506, 507): 'The liability thus imposed is limited to 'any loss, injury, or damage caused by it or a succeeding carrier to whom the property may be delivered,' and plainly implies a liability for some default in its common-law duty as a common carrier.' Properly understood, neither this nor any other of our opinions holds that this amendment has changed the common-law doctrine theretofore approved by us in respect of a carrier's liability for loss occurring on its own line.\n The state courts, treating the bill of lading as properly in evidence, undertook to determine its validity and effect. We need not, therefore, consider the mooted questions of pleading. The shipment being interstate, rights and liabilities of the parties depend upon acts of Congress, the bill \n\n[241 U.S. 319, 327]\n\u00a0\n of lading, and common-law rules as accepted and applied in Federal tribunals. Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Dettlebach, \n239 U.S. 588\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 177; Southern Exp. Co. v. Byers, \n240 U.S. 612\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410, and cases cited; Southern R. Co. v. Prescott, \n240 U.S. 632\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 469.\n We cannot assent to the theory apparently adopted below that the interpretation and effect of a bill of lading issued by a railroad in connection with an interstate shipment present no Federal question unless there is affirmative proof showing actual compliance with the interstate commerce act. It cannot be assumed, merely because the contrary has not been established by proof, that an interstate carrier is conducting its affairs in violation of law. Such a carrier must comply with strict requirements of the Federal statutes or become subject to heavy penalties, and, in respect of transactions in the ordinary course of business, it is entitled to the presumption of right conduct. The law 'presumes that every man, in his private and official character, does his duty, until the contrary is proved, it will presume that all things are rightly done, unless the circumstances of the case overturn this presumption, according to the maxim, omnia presumuntur rite et solemnitur esse acta, donec probetur in contrarium.'

Rep. 240.\n Under our former opinions the settled doctrine is that where alternate rates, fairly based upon valuation, are offered, a railroad may limit its liability by special contract. George N. Pierce Co. v. Wells, F . & Co. \n236 \nU.S. 278, 283\n, 59 S. L. ed. 576, 581, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 351.\n The essential choice of rates must be made to appear before a carrier can successfully claim the benefit of such a limitation and relief from full liability. And as no interstate rates are lawful unless duly filed with the Commission, it may become necessary for the carrier to prove its \n\n[241 U.S. 319, 328]\n\u00a0\n schedules in order to make out the requisite choice. But where a bill of lading, signed by both parties, recites that lawful alternate rates based on specified values were offered, such recitals constitute admissions by the shipper and sufficient prima facie evidence of choice. If, in such a case, the shipper wishes to contradict his own admissions, the burden of proof is upon him. York Mfg. Co. v. Illinois C. R.

App. 409, 412; Hutchinson, Carr. 3d ed.  475.\n The bill of lading in question is plainly entitled, 'Contract for Limited Liability in the Transportation of Live Stock at Reduced Rates,' and contains the conspicuous provisions concerning published rates, tariff regulations, choice offered the shipper, and limit upon the carrier's liability, etc., above set out. In view of these recitals and admissions, the limitation of liability must be treated as prima facie valid, and, consequently, the trial court erred in holding it void as a matter of law, and permitting a recovery for full value of the animals.\n The judgment below is reversed and the cause remanded to the Supreme Court of Tennessee for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'That any common carrier, railroad, or transportation company receiving property for transportation from a point in one state to a point in another state shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it or by any common carrier, railroad, or transportation company to which such property may be delivered or over whose line or lines such property may pass, and no contract, receipt, rule, or regulation shall exempt such common carrier, railroad, or transportation company from the liability hereby imposed: Provided, That nothing in this section shall deprive any holder of such receipt or bill of lading of any remedy or right of action which he has under existing law . . . .'

Bullington for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n As owner in trust for the people of the state of certain described lands, the state of Tennessee in a state court commenced this action in 1903 against Cissna and others to recover the lands, and to restrain cutting timber thereon, and for an accounting for timber already cut. A temporary injunction was granted against removing and cutting timber, which was modified by permitting, on the giving of a bond, the removal of timber already cut, and was subsequently again modified by allowing all the timber on the land to be cut and removed on the giving of an additional bond. By pleas in abatement and answers the jurisdiction of the court was denied on the ground that the lands were not in Tennessee, but in Arkansas, and this was sustained and the suit dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The supreme court of the state, however, reversed this action and remanded the case for trial on the merits. 119 Tenn. 47, 104 S. W. 437.\n The pleadings were amended in the trial court, and while the case was there undetermined, the state of Arkansas filed in this court its complaint against Tennessee to settle \n\n[242 U.S. 195, 197]\n\u00a0\n the boundary line between the two. The bill made reference to the suit pending in Tennessee and alleged that the lands embraced by that suit were in Arkansas, subject to its sovereignty, and denied the power of the state of Tennessee in its own courts to interfere with the lawful authority of the state of Arkansas. Thereafter the existence of the suit in this court was alleged in the state court, and that court was asked to suspend proceedings until the decision in the boundary case. This was denied and a judgment was entered in favor of the state of Tennessee, holding that the lands were in Tennessee and belonged to that state, and this judgment was subsequently affirmed by the supreme court of the state. In that court also the pendency of the original suit between the two states in this court was specially set up and an application for suspension of proceedings, based on the fact, was prayed, but was refused. The judgment of the supreme court of the state not only decreeed the lands to belong to the state of Tennessee in its sovereign capacity, on the ground that they were situated within that state, but gave a recovery for the amount of the timber cut before the bringing of the suit, and also for the money value of the balance of the timber on the lands which had been cut and removed as the result of the modification of the injunction, permitting that to be done.\n At the threshold jurisdiction to review the judgment thus rendered is denied on the ground that no Federal question arises for decision.\n It is conceded in argument by both parties that the decision of the merits of this case will necessarily be the equivalent of a decision of the boundary suit pending on our original calendar between the two states, and that an affirmance of the money judgment below will in substance be an award for virtually the entire avails of the lands in suit in this case, as well as of the greater part, if not all, of the lands to be affected in the boundary suit. More- \n\n[242 U.S. 195, 198]\n\u00a0\n over, in substance it is not disputed that the facts here presented are identical with those upon which the solution of the boundary suit must depend. Under these conditions we think, without intimating an opinion on the question of jurisdiction raised in this case, or on the merits, that we ought not to consider and pass upon this case without at the same time considering and passing upon the controversy concerning the boundary between the two states, now pending on our docket. The identity of the two issues, the possible influence which the decision of the one would have on the rights pending in the other, and the fact that the actor, the state of Tennessee, in this suit, is the defendant in the original suit, we think render that conclusion necessary.\n For these reasons we direct that this case be restored to the docket and that it be hereafter assigned for hearing at the same time and immediately after the coming on for hearing of the original boundary suit between the two states. And to the end that that hearing may be expedited, we say in addition, first, that if the facts in the boundary case be stipulated by the parties either by reference to the facts shown in this case or otherwise, both the cases will be taken on submission on printed briefs, if the parties are so advised; or second, if they are not so advised, upon an agreement and stipulation as to the facts in the boundary case, that case and this will be ordered advanced and assigned for oral argument at an early day.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCLEVELAND, C C & ST L R.

Stocker, and Jesse A. Fenner for defendant in error. \n\n[239 U.S. 588, 589]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n The court whose judgment we have here under review sustained a judgment rendered by an inferior state court in favor of Dettlebach and against the railway company for the market value of certain goods which, having been shipped in interstate commerce, were lost through the negligence of the railway company (the terminal carrier) while in its possession as warehouseman at the place of destination; overruling the contention that, because of a limitation of liability agreed upon by plaintiff's agent in consideration of a reduced rate of freight, and contained in the bill of lading that was issued by the initial carrier, and by force of the provisions of the interstate commerce act and its amendments, especially the Hepburn act of 1906 [34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563], the recovery ought to be limited in accordance with the stipulation. This question, it may be observed, as affecting the warehouseman's responsibility, was not passed upon in Boston & M. R. Co. v. Hooker, \n233 \nU.S. 97, 109\n, 58 S. L. ed. 868, 874, L.R.A.1915B, 450, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 593.\n The facts are as follows: Dettlebach, the plaintiff, on September 18, 1911, shipped certain packages of merchandise, described as household goods, over the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railway and connecting lines from Denver, Colorado, consigned to his with at Cleveland, Ohio. They were received for transportation under the terms of a bill of lading, prepared in the form approved and recommended by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its report of June 27, 1908 (14 Inters. Com. Rep. 346, 352; 22 Ann. Rep. I. C. C. 1908, p. 57), which contained the following provision:\n'It is mutually agreed, as to each carrier of all or any of said property over all or any portion of said route to destination, and as to each party at any time interested in all or any of said property, that every service to be performed \n\n[239 U.S. 588, 590]\n\u00a0\n hereunder shall be subject to all the conditions, whether printed or written, herein contained (including conditions on back hereof), and which are agreed to by the shipper and accepted for himself and his assigns.'\n\n Among the conditions printed upon the back were the following:\n'Sec. 3. . . . The amount of any loss or damage for which any carrier is liable shall be computed on the basis of the value of the property . . . at the place and time of shipment under this bill of lading, unless a lower value has been represented in writing by the shipper or has been agreed upon or is determined by the classification or tariffs upon which the rate is based, in any of which events such lower value shall be the maximum amount to govern such computation, whether or not such loss or damage occurs from negligence. . . .'\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 5. Property not removed by the party entitled to receive it within forty-eight hours (exclusive of legal holidays) after notice of its arrival has been duly sent or given may be kept in car, depot, or place of delivery of the carrier, or warehouse, subject to a reasonable charge for storage and to carrier's responsibility as warehouseman only. . . .'\n\n Upon the face of the bill of lading was the following declaration signed by plaintiff's agent: 'I hereby declare the valuation of the property shipped under this bill of lading does not exceed $10 per cwt.'\n The court found as a fact that the shipper, by consenting to the limitation, received a consideration in the shape of a substantial reduction in the freight rate, and that this supported the agreement to limit the company's liability. No question was made but that the agreement was in accordance with the filed tariff.\n The goods thus shipped were transported by the initial carrier to the junction between its line and that of defend- \n\n[239 U.S. 588, 591]\n\u00a0\n ant, and transported by the latter company to destination, where they arrived on September 27. They were not called for by the consignee, and remained in defendant's possession as warehouseman until November 1, 1911, when, through its negligence, certain of the goods, of the market value of $ 2,792, were lost.\n This action having been brought to recover the value of the goods lost, and the claim of Federal right already mentioned having been made and overruled, a verdict and judgment went against defendant for the market value of the goods, and this was affirmed by the court of appeals, eighth district, state of Ohio. The supreme court of the state declined to review the judgment. The case comes here under  237, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1214].\n It is no longer open to question that if the loss had occurred in the course of transportation upon defendant's line, the limitation of liability agreed upon with the initial carrier, as this was, for the purpose of securing the lower of two rates of freight, would have been binding upon plaintiff, in view of the Carmack amendment. Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 \nU.S. 491, 509\n, 57 S. L. ed. 314, 321, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148; Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl. \n227 \nU.S. 639, 648\n, 654 S., 57 L. ed. 683, 686, 689, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Harriman, \n227 \nU.S. 657, 668\n, 57 S. L. ed. 690, 696, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397. The question is whether the limitation of liability may be deemed to have spent its force upon the completion of the carrier's service as such, or must be held to control, also, during the ensuing relation of warehouseman. The court of appeals, recognizing the question as one of difficulty, reasoned thus:\n'To occupy this twofold relation is of advantage to the company. As soon as the company can occupy it by replacing with it its former relation as a common carrier, it obtains the benefit of the rule of ordinary care instead of the higher degree of vigilance which the law charges upon carriers for hire. And the company is further advantaged by an early shifting of its status as carrier to that of warehouseman, through its right in the latter capacity to \n\n[239 U.S. 588, 592]\n\u00a0\n charge for the storage of consigned goods. from the time when its relation to them as carrier ceases.'\n\n The court considered that the declaration of value stamped upon the bill of lading, and signed by plaintiff's agent, carried no suggestion that it should inure to the advantage of a warehouseman after becoming inert for the relief of the carrier, and that the custody and protection of the goods as warehouseman is a distinct service from that of their transportation, and for it additional compensation may be charged; proceeding as follows: 'The additional compensation is not at all diminished in this case because of the agreement of limitation of liability. The reduction in the rate of carriage which can be used as a consideration to support that agreement is no consideration for a like limitation of the liability as warehouseman, because there is no reduction in warehousing charges provided or stipulated for in the transaction. It is not easy to see why the consideration-not a large one-which is permitted to support the agreement to a limited liability on the part of the carrier should do double duty by serving also to uphold a like limitation of the liability of a warehouseman,-the latter not agreeing to abate any part of proper storage charges. To so extend the contract of release would give an advantage to the warehouseman, but none to the owner. To allow that consideration would be to permit the carrier to cast off his obligation as carrier and take up a lighter burden, while he denies to the shipper all right to share in the benefit of the changed relation. The rate which the warehouseman may charge for storage remains unaffected by the release of liability as a carrier. The warehouseman could collect the reasonable value of his service whether the limitation of the carrier's liability was or was not stipulated. He could not be compelled to take less because of the stipulation. He could collect no more if the stipulation had not been made.'\n We recognize the cogency of the reasoning from the \n\n[239 U.S. 588, 593]\n\u00a0\n standpoint of the common-law responsibility of a railway company as carrier and as warehouseman. But we have to deal with the effect of an express contract, made for the purpose of interstate transportation, and this must be determined in the light of the act of Congress regulating the matter. The question is Federal in its nature. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Harriman, \n227 \nU.S. 657, 672\n, 57 S. L. ed. 690, 698, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397; Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Robinson, \n233 \nU.S. 173, 180\n, 58 S. L. ed. 901, 905, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 556.\n The provision that we have quoted from the contract is to the effect that 'every service to be performed thereunder' is subject to the conditions contained in it One of these conditions is, in substance, that where a valuation has been agreed upon between the shipper and the carrier, such value shall be the maximum amount for which any carrier may be held liable, whether or not the loss or damage occurs from negligence. And that this, as a mere matter of construction, applies to the relation of warehouseman as well as to the strict relation of carrier, is manifest from the further provision that property not removed within forty-eight hours after notice of arrival may be kept 'subject to a reasonable charge for storage and to carrier's responsibility as warehouseman only.' Thus, 'any loss or damage for which any carrier is liable' includes not merely the responsibility of carrier, strictly so called, but 'carrier's responsibility as warehouseman' also.\n And this is quite in line with the letter and policy of the commerce act, and especially of the amendment of June 29, 1906, known as the Hepburn act (34 Stat. at. L. 584, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563), which enlarged the definition of the term 'transportation' (this, under the original act, included merely 'all instruments of shipment or carriage') so as to include 'cars and other vehicles and all instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage, irrespective of ownership or of any contract, express or implied, for the use thereof and all services in connection with the receipt, deliv- \n\n[239 U.S. 588, 594]\n\u00a0\n ery, elevation, and transfer in transit, ventilation, refrigeration or icing, storage, and handling of property transported; and it shall be the duty of every carrier subject to the provisions of this act to provide and furnish such transportation upon reasonable request therefor, and to establish through routes and just and reasonable rates applicable thereto. All charges made for any service rendered or to be rendered in the transportation of passengers or property as aforesaid, or in connection therewith, shall be just and reasonable; and every unjust and unreasonable charge for such service or any part thereof is prohibited and declared to be unlawful.'\n From this and other provisions of the Hepburn act it is evident that Congress recognized that the duty of carriers to the public included the performance of a variety of services that, according to the theory of the common law, were separable from the carrier's service as carrier, and, in order to prevent overcharges and discriminations from being made under the pretext of performing such additional services, it enacted that, so far as interstate carriers by rail were concerned, the entire body of such services should be included together under the single term 'transportation,' and subjected to the provisions of the act respecting reasonable rates and the like. The recommendation of the Interstate Commerce Commission for the adoption of the uniform bill of lading was of course made in view of this legislation, and while not intended to be and not in law binding upon the carriers, it is entitled to some weight. It recognizes-whether correctly or not is a question not now presented-the right of the carrier to make a charge, the amount of which has not been definitely fixed in advance, for storage as warehouseman in addition to the charge for transportation; but at the same time it recognizes that a valuation lower than the actual value may be agreed upon between the shipper and the carrier, or determined by the classifi- \n\n[239 U.S. 588, 595]\n\u00a0\n cation or tariffs upon which the rate is based; and it is a necessary corollary that what should be a reasonable charge for storage would be determined in the light of all the circumstances, including the valuation placed upon the goods.\n We conclude that, under the provisions of the Hepburn act and the terms of the bill of landing, the valuation placed upon the property here in question must be held to apply to defendant's responsibility as warehouseman.\n Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Holmes took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOM.

Virginia now petitions for a writ of execution against West Virginia, on the ground that such relief is necessary, as the latter has taken no steps whatever to provide for the payment of the decree. West Virginia resists the granting of the execution on three grounds: (1) 'Because the state of West Virginia, within herself, has no power to pay the judgment in question, except through the legislative department of her government, and she should be given an opportunity to accept and abide by the decision of this court, and, in the due and ordinary course, to make provision for its satisfaction, before any steps looking to her compulsion be taken; and to issue an execution at this time would deprive her of such opportunity, because her legislature has not met since the rendition of said judgment, and will not again meet in regular session until the second Wednesday in January, 1917, and the members of that body have not yet been chosen;' (2) because presumptively the state of West Virginia has no property subject to execution; and (3) because, although the Constitution imposes upon this court the duty, and grants it full power, to consider controversies between states, and therefore authority to render the decree in question, yet with the grant of jurisdiction there was conferred no authority whatever to enforce a money judgment against a state if, in the exercise of jurisdiction, such a judgment was entered.\n Without going further, we are of the opinion that the first ground furnishes adequate reason for not granting the motion at this time.\n The prayer for the issue of a writ of execution is therefore denied, without prejudice to the renewal of the same after the next session of the legislature of the state of West Virginia has met and had a reasonable opportunity to provide for the payment of the judgment.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMERCIAL NAT. BANK OF NEW ORLEANS v. CANAL-LOUISIANA BANK &(1916)\nNo. 117\nArgued: December 8, 1915Decided: January 10, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 520, 521]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edwin T. Merrick for appellant.\n Mr. Henry Mooney for appellees.\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 520, 522]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a controversy arising in a bankruptcy proceeding. The Commercial National Bank of New Orleans petitioned the district court for the recovery from the trustee in bankruptcy of certain bales of cotton alleged to have been held by the bankrupts, Dreuil & Company, for the account of the petitioner under trust receipts. The Canal-Louisiana Bank & Trust Company defended, presenting its reconventional demand based upon a claim of superior title. The district court entered a decree in favor of the Canal-Louisiana Bank & Trust Company (205 Fed. 568), which was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 128 C. C. A. 16, 211 Fed. 337.\n The controversy arises from the following transactions which were had prior to the bankruptcy. On December 9, 1912, Dreuil & Company, holding inland bills of lading for two lots of cotton (40 bales and 60 bales respectively), pledged the bills of lading with the Canal-Louisiana Bank to secure certain promissory notes for moneys advanced. On December 13, 1912, the bills of lading were withdrawn from the Canal-Louisiana Bank on trust receipts, as follows:\n'Received of Canal Bank & Trust Company the bills of lading or other documents or securities as enumerated below, held by the said bank as collateral pledged to secure advances made to the undersigned, and in consideration thereof, the undersigned hereby agrees to pay over to the said bank or its assigns, and to specifically apply against the very same advances the proceeds of the sale of the property mentioned in the said documents; or to deliver to the said bank or its assignees the shipping documents or warehouse receipts representing the undermentioned goods within one day from the receipt thereof, this delivery being temporarily made the undersigned for convenience only, without novation of the original debt, or giving the undersigned any title thereto, except as \n\n[239 U.S. 520, 523]\n\u00a0\n trustee for the said bank, and except to receive the avails thereof or the documents therefor for account of the said bank.'\n\n Dreuil & Company, surrendering the bills of lading to the railroad company, obtained delivery of the cotton and sent it to a 'pickery,' where the lot of 40 bales was remade into 60, and the lot of 60 bales into 90. Dreuil & Company then stored the cotton with a warehouseman, the Planters' Press, receiving two negotiable warehouse receipts which, on December 17, 1912, they pledged to the Commercial Bank as security for their notes. On December 20, 1912, and December 28, 1912, these warehouse receipts, respectively, were withdrawn by Dreuil & Company from the Commercial Bank on trust receipts similar in tenor to those which had been given, as above stated, to the Canal-Louisiana Bank. Dreuil & Company then obtained a delivery of the cotton from the Planters' Press; on December 31, 1912, they were adjudicated bankrupts and temporary receivers were appointed. It appears that 60 of the bales had been disposed of, but the remainder of the cotton, which had been sent by Dreuil & Company to a steamer for shipment, was recovered by the receivers and placed by them in the Planters' Press, warehouse receipts being issued therefor which passed into the possession of the trustee. Despite the changes mentioned, and re- markings (which we need not consider), the district court found the identity of the cotton to be established, and there is no further controversy upon that point. Nor is it controverted that the Commercial Bank was a purchaser in good faith for value of the warehouse receipts negotiated to it.\n We assume that under the jurisprudence of Louisiana the transaction between Dreuil & Company and the Canal-Louisiana Bank (described by the bank as a pledge), created rights in the bank in the nature of ownership for the purpose of securing its advances (Rev. Stat. [La.] \n\n[239 U.S. 520, 524]\n\u00a0\n 2482; Civil Code, arts. 3157, 3158, 3170, 3173; Fidelity & D. Co. v. Johnston, 117 La. 880, 889, 42 So. 357; act 94 of 1912 [uniform bills of lading act],  32); and that when the Canal-Louisiana Bank intrusted the bills of lading to Dreuil & Company for the purposes described in the trust receipts, given to that bank, it could still assert its title as against Dreuil & Company and their trustees in bankruptcy. See Clark v. Iselin, 21 Wall. 360, 368, 22 L. ed. 568, 571; Re E. Reboulin Fils & Co. 165 Fed. 245; Charavay v. York Silk Mfg. Co. 170 Fed. 819; Re Cattus, 106 C. C.

E. 810; Hamilton v. Billington, 163 Pa. 76, 43 Am. St. Rep. 780, 29 Atl. 904; Williston, Sales,  437. No question is presented as to the effect, in the light of the uniform bills of lading act passed in Louisiana in 1912 (act 94), of an attempted negotiation by Dreuil & Company of the bills of lading contrary to the terms of the trust receipts. See Roland M. Baker Co. v. Brown, 214 Mass. 196, 203, 100 N. E. 1025. The bills of lading were not negotiated; they served their purpose, being surrendered to the railroad company on the delivery of the goods to Dreuil & Company. The transactions with the 'pickery' are not material to the question to be decided. Dreuil & Company having obtained possession of the cotton, as was contemplated, placed it in store and the question is as to the effect of the negotiation of the warehouse receipts to the Commercial Bank.\n It is a familiar rule that one who has no title to chattels cannot transfer title unless he has the owner's authority or the owner is estopped. See Civil Code (La.) arts. 2452, 3142, 3145, 3146. It follows that, in the absence of circumstances creating an estoppel, one without title can- \n\n[239 U.S. 520, 525]\n\u00a0\n not transfer it by the simple device of warehousing the goods and indorsing the receipts. But if the owner of the goods has permitted another to be clothed with the apparent ownership through the possession of warehouse receipts, negotiable in form, there is abundant ground for protecting a bona fide purchaser for value to whom the receipts have been negotiated. Pollard v. Reardon, 13 C. C. A. 171, 21 U. S. App. 639, 65 Fed. 848, 852; Williston, Sales,  421. The effect of the negotiation of warehouse receipts is defined in the uniform warehouse receipts act, enacted in Louisiana by act 221 of 1908. This act provides:\n'Sec. 40. Who may negotiate a receipt.-A negotiable receipt may be negotiated--\n\n'(a) By the owner thereof; or\n\n'(b) By any person to whom the possession or custody of the receipt has been intrusted by the owner, if, by the terms of the receipt, the warehouseman undertakes to deliver the goods to the order of the person to whom the possession or custody of the receipt has been intrusted, or if at the time of such intrusting the receipt is in such form that it may be negotiated by delivery.'\n\n'Sec. 41. Rights of person to whom a receipt has been negotiated.-A person to whom a negotiable receipt has been duly negotiated acquires thereby--\n\n'(a) Such title to the goods as the person negotiating the receipt to him had or had ability to convey to a purchaser in good faith for value, and also such title to the goods as the depositor or person to whose order the goods were to be delivered by the terms of the receipt had or had ability to convey to a purchaser in good faith for value; and\n\n'(b) The direct obligation of the warehouseman to hold possession of the goods for him according to the terms of the receipt as fully as if the warehouseman had contracted directly with him.'\n\n ... * * \n\n[239 U.S. 520, 526]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 47. When negotiation not impaired by fraud, mistake, or duress.- The validity of the negotiation of a receipt is not impaired by the fact that such negotiation was a breach of duty on the part of the person making the negotiation, or by the fact that the owner of the receipt was induced by fraud, mistake, or duress to intrust the possession or custody of the receipt to such person, if the person to whom the receipt was negotiated, or a person to whom the receipt was subsequently negotiated, paid value therefor, without notice of the breach of duty, or fraud, mistake, or duress.'\n It will be observed that 'one who takes by trespass or a finder is not included within the description of those who may negotiate.' (Report of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, January 1, 1910, p. 204.) Aside from this, the intention is plain to facilitate the use of warehouse receipts as documents of title. Under  40, the person who may negotiate the receipt is either the 'owner thereof,' or a 'person to whom the possession or custody of the receipt has been intrusted by the owner' if the receipt is in the form described. The warehouse receipt represents the goods, but the intrusting of the receipt, as stated, is more than the mere delivery of the goods; it is a representation that the one to whom the possession of the receipt has been so intrusted has the title to the goods. By  47, the negotiation of the receipt to a purchaser for value without notice is not impaired by the fact that it is a breach of duty, or that the owner of the receipt was induced 'by fraud, mistake, or duress' to intrust the receipt to the person who negotiated it. And, under  41, one to whom the negotiable receipt has been duly negotiated acquires such title to the goods as the person negotiating the receipt to him, or the depositor or person to whose order the goods were deliverable by the terms of the receipt, either had or 'had ability to convey to a purchaser in good faith for value.' The \n\n[239 U.S. 520, 527]\n\u00a0\n clear import of these provisions is that if the owner of the goods permits another to have the possession or custody of negotiable warehouse receipts running to the order of the latter, or to bearer, it is a representation of title upon which bona fide purchasers for value are entitled to rely, despite breaches of trust or violations of agreement on the part of the apparent owner.\n It cannot be doubted that if Dreuil & Company had pledged to the Commercial Bank the bills of lading which they withdrew from the Canal- Louisiana Bank under the trust receipts, the former, paying value in good faith, would have had the superior right. This would have been directly within the terms of the uniform bills of lading act (La. act 94, 1912,  31, 32, 38, 39). Roland M. Baker Co. v. Brown, supra; see William T. Hardie & Co. v. Vicksburg, S. & P. R. Co. 118 La. 254, 42 So. 793. It seems to be contended that the case is different with the warehouse receipts. But it cannot be said that it was not within the contemplation of the parties that Dreuil & Company, on obtaining the goods from the railroad company, should put them in warehouse and take the usual receipts. As we have stated, we are not concerned with what happened at the 'pickery,' as the case is precisely the same, so far as the Commercial Bank is concerned, as if the original bales had been warehoused (without remaking) as soon as received. It was not the placing of the cotton in warehouse in the usual course of business, but the negotiation of the receipts, that constituted the violation of Dreuil & Company's agreement with the Canal- Louisiana Bank. By the very terms of that agreement Dreuil & Company were to take the position of 'trustee' for the bank, with authority to receive 'the avails' of the goods or 'the documents' therefor for account of the bank, and being bound to apply the proceeds of sale to the bank's advances. And in taking documents of title, in ordinary course, pursuant to the agreement, which was intended to facilitate the \n\n[239 U.S. 520, 528]\n\u00a0\n disposition of the cotton through Dreuil & Company, the latter were manifestly permitted to take such documents to their own order, as they took the bills of lading with which they were intrusted. To repeat, it was the negotiation of the receipts that constituted the breach of trust. But after the Canal-Louisiana Bank had allowed Reuil & Company to be clothed with apparent ownership through possession of the receipts, it cannot be Bank had allowed Dreuil & Company to be purchaser for value to whom they had been negotiated. Re Richheimer, 136 C. C. A. 542, 221 Fed. 16.\n It is said that under the law of Louisiana, as it stood prior to the enactment of the uniform warehouse receipts act, the Commercial Bank would not have taken title as against the Canal-Louisiana Bank (Stern Bros. v. Germania Nat. Bank, 34 La. Ann. 1119; Lallande v. His Creditors, 42 La. Ann. 705, 7 So. 895; Holton v. Hubbard, 49 La. Ann. 715, 22 So. 338; Mechanics' & T. Ins. Co. v. Kiger, \n103 U.S. 352\n, 26 L. ed. 433; but see William T. Hardie & Co. v. Vicksburg, S. & P. R. Co. supra); and it is urged that the new statute is but a step in the development of the law, and that decisions under the former state statutes are safe guides to its construction. We do not find it necessary to review these decisions. It is apparent that if these uniform acts are construed in the several states adopting them according to former local views upon analogous subjects, we shall miss the desired uniformity, and we shall erect upon the foundation of uniform language separate legal structures as distinct as were the former varying laws. It was to prevent this result that the uniform warehouse receipts act expressly provides ( 57): 'This act shall be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those states which enact it.' This rule of construction requires that in order to accomplish the beneficent object of unifying, so far as this is possible under our dual system, the commercial law of the country, there should be taken into consideration the funda- \n\n[239 U.S. 520, 529]\n\u00a0\n mental purpose of the uniform act, and that it should not be regarded merely as an offshoot of local law. The cardinal principle of the act- which has been adopted in many states-is to give effect, within the limits stated, to the mercantile view of documents of title. There had been statutes in some of the states dealing with such documents, but there still remained diversity of legal rights under similar commercial transactions. We think that the principle of the uniform act should have recognition to the exclusion of any inconsistent doctrine which may have previously obtained in any of the states enacting it; and, in this view, we deem it to be clear that, in the circumstances disclosed, the Commercial Bank took title to the warehouse receipts and to the cotton in question.\n Finally, it is insisted that whatever right the Commercial Bank might have had, if it had retained the warehouse receipts, it lost as against the Canal-Louisiana Bank by permitting Dreuil & Company to withdraw the documents under the trust receipts which they gave to the Commercial Bank; that is, that as the cotton came into the possession of Dreuil & Company, the equities of the two banks are equal, and the earlier equity should prevail. We think that this contention begs the question. The Commercial Bank did not lose its rights by permitting the withdrawal of its warehouse receipts under the agreement to hold for its account, any more than the Canal-Louisiana Bank lost its rights merely by the withdrawal of the bills of lading under its trust receipts. It was because the Canal-Louisiana Bank clothed Dreuil & Company with the indicia of ownership that a bona fide purchaser for value was enabled to take title; and a similar result would have followed if, after the withdrawal of the warehouse house receipts from the Commercial Bank, there had been a like negotiation by Dreuil & Company. But there was no subsequent negotiation, and the Commercial \n\n[239 U.S. 520, 530]\n\u00a0\n Bank, in the absence of the intervention of a purchaser in good faith for value, did not lose its rights by the agreement under which the cotton which it had duly acquired was to be held for its account. There is no equality of equities, for it was through the action of the Canal-Louisiana Bank and the apparent ownership it created in Dreuil & Company that the Commercial Bank was led to advance its money upon the faith of the documents of title.\n The decree is reversed and the cause is remanded, with direction to enter a decree in favor of the appellant.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOON RAPIDS NAT BANK v.

The contractor was a New Jersey corporation and its trustee in bankruptcy is the present claimant. In the court of claims a small part of the claim was sustained and the balance rejected. 49 Ct. Cl. 85. Only the claimant appeals, so the part sustained is not here in controversy. \n\n[240 U.S. 74, 76]\n\u00a0\n As shown by the findings the facts are these: By public advertisement in May, 1902, the Postmaster General solicited bids for furnishing letter carriers' satchels for the free delivery service for a period of four years. Shortly after the advertisement the New Jersey company and one Lorenz entered into a written agreement whereby the company employed him to assist in securing for it the contract for furnishing the satchels, it being particularly stipulated that he and the company's vice president, one Crawford, should determine the bid to be made, and should present it in the company's name; that, if the company got the contract, Lorenz should receive all profits arising out of the same in excess of 25 cents on each satchel, and that, if the company did not get the contract, he was to accept $1 as full payment for his services. Lorenz and Crawford then entered into a secret arrangement with one Machen, who was superintendent of the free delivery service and charged with important duties relating to the purchase of the satchels, whereby, in the event the company got the contract, Lorenz's share of the profits was to be divided among them on the basis of one half to Machen and one fourth to each of the others. After this arrangement was made a bid for the satchels was prepared and submitted in the company's name, and was accepted by the Postmaster General. The contract sued upon followed in regular course, the company agreeing therein to furnish the satchels in such quantities and at such times as the postoffice authorities might direct. The satchels were to be of three classes, those of classes A and C to have shoulder straps and those of class B to be without straps. The prices to be paid by the government were $2.19 for each satchel of class A; $3.16 for each of class B., and $3.15 for each of class C. This included the shoulder straps on those of classes A and C. The company was not a manufacturer of satchels or of the materials used in making them, and to enable it to comply with \n\n[240 U.S. 74, 77]\n\u00a0\n the contract it arranged, through Crawford, to have the satchels made by a manufacturer at Hartford, Connecticut. But, as the manufacturer could not supply shoulder straps of the type required, the company and Lorenz entered into a further agreement to the effect that Lorenz should supply the shoulder straps, that out of what was paid by the government for the satchels the company should pay him 45 cents on each satchel of class A, $ 1.19 on each of class B, and 84 cents on each of class C, as his share of the profits and to reimburse him for supplying the straps. Crawford and Machen had conferred about the straps, and Machen had said that the government would get the straps, pay for them, send them to the company's manufacturer, and adjust any difference afterwards.\n Thereafter and prior to March 17, 1903, the company furnished over 10, 000 satchels pursuant to the terms of the contract, save that the shoulder straps on those of classes A and C, which were in excess of $5,000, were provided and paid for by the government, through Machen, at a cost of 39 1\/2 cents each. These satchels were all paid for by the government, through Machen, at the contract rates without any deduction for the straps. Out of the moneys so received the company paid Lorenz 45 cents on each satchel of class A, $1.19 on each of class B, and 84 cents on each of class C, and he in turn divided what he received with Machen and Crawford.\n Between March 17 and April 30, 1903, the company furnished 6,201 more satchels, pursuant to the terms of the contract, save that the shoulder straps on those of classes A and C, of which there were 4,912, were provided and paid for by the government, through Machen, at a cost of 39 1\/2 cents each. These satchels were accepted and retained by the postoffice authorities. But when payment for them under the contract was requested, it was refused. This was because the Postmaster General had then learned of the corrupt arrangement giving \n\n[240 U.S. 74, 78]\n\u00a0\n Machen an interest in the profits, and had rescinded the contract and stopped further payments under it.\n No shoulder straps were furnished by the company, through Lorenz or otherwise, and both he and Crawford knew that the straps were purchased and supplied by the government. Before the rescission by the Postmaster General the company did not know that Machen was to share or was sharing in the profits, or that the government was supplying the shoulder straps, save as the company may have been chargeable with the knowledge of Lorenz and Crawford, who represented it in securing and executing the contract.\n It was for furnishing the 6,201 satchels after March 17, 1903, that a recovery was sought in the court of claims, and the part of the claim rejected was for the 4,912 satchels of classes A and C, the rejection being put on the grounds (a) that no recovery could be had upon the contract, because it called for satchels with shoulder straps and the company did not furnish the straps, and (b) that no recovery could be had upon a quantum valebat, because the value of the satchels as furnished was not shown.\n In the briefs reference is made to portions of the opinion delivered in the court of claims as if they were not in accord with the findings. We do not so read the opinion, but deem it well to observe, as was done in Stone v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 380, 382\n, 383 S., 41 L. ed. 477, 478, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 71, that 'the findings of the court of claims in an action at law determine all matters of fact precisely as the verdict of a jury,' and that 'we are not at liberty to refer to the opinion for the purpose of eking out, controlling, or modifying the scope of the findings.' See also Collier v. United States, \n173 \nU.S. 79, 80\n, 43 S. L. ed. 621, 622, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 330; United States v. New York Indians, \n173 \nU.S. 464, 470\n, 43 S. L. ed. 769, 771, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 487.\n We are of opinion that in the transactions out of which the claim arose there was an obvious departure from recognized legal and moral standards. It began when the company employed Lorenz, upon a compensation contingent \n\n[240 U.S. 74, 79]\n\u00a0\n upon success, to secure the contract for furnishing the satchels, and it persisted until its discovery by the Postmaster General led to the rescission of the contract. Because of their baneful tendency as here illustrated, agreements like that under which Lorenz was employed are deemed inconsistent with sound morals and public policy, and therefore invalid. Dealing with such an agreement this court said in Providence Tool Co. v. Norris, 2 Wall. 45, 54, 55, 17 L. ed. 868, 870, 871: 'All contracts for supplies should be made with those, and with those only, who will execute them most faithfully, and at the least expense to the government. Considerations as to the most efficient and economical mode of meeting the public wants should alone control, in this respect, the action of every department of the government. No other consideration can lawfully enter into the transaction, so far as the government is concerned. Such is the rule of public policy; and whatever tends to introduce any other elements into the transaction is against public policy. That agreements like the one under consideration have this tendency is manifest. They tend to introduce personal solicitation and personal influence as elements in the procurement of contracts; and thus directly lead to inefficiency in the public service, and to unnecessary expenditures of the public funds. . . . Agreements for compensation contingent upon success suggest the use of sinister and corrupt means for the accomplishment of the end desired. The law meets the suggestion of evil, and strikes down the contract from its inception. There is no real difference in principle between agreements to procure favors from legislative bodies, and agreements to procure favors in the shape of contracts from the heads of departments. The introduction of improper elements to control the action of both is the direct and inevitable result of all such arrangements.' Further recognition of this rule is found in Marshall v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. 16 How. 314, \n\n[240 U.S. 74, 80]\n\u00a0\n 334, 335, 14 L. ed. 953, 961, 962; Trist v. Child (Busker v. Child) 21 Wall. 441, 22 L. ed. 623; Meguire v. Corwine, \n101 U.S. 108\n, 25 L. ed. 899; Oscanyan v. Winchester Repeating Arms Co. \n103 \nU.S. 261, 273\n, 26 S. L. ed. 539, 544; Sage v. Hampe, \n235 \nU.S. 99, 105\n, 59 S. L. ed. 147, 150, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 94.\n The secret arrangement whereby Machen was to share in the profits was most reprehensible. Its natural effect, as also its purpose, was to secure for the company an inadmissible advantage. The satchels were wanted for the free delivery service, and Machen's relation to that service made it probable, if not certain, that his advice respecting the reasonableness of the bid, the number of satchels required from time to time, and the company's performance of the contract, would be sought and given consideration by his superiors in the Postoffice Department. The advertisement for bids, the postal regulations (1902 ed.  17 and 70), and the findings leave no doubt that he was charged with important duties of that character. Public policy and sound morals forbade that he should have any personal interest in the bid or contract lest he might be tempted to advance that interest at the expense of the government. Under the secret arrangement, which was made before the bid was submitted, he had such an interest and therefore was in a position where the hope of personal gain was likely to exercise a predominant influence and prevent a faithful discharge of his public duties, as in fact it did. Referring to this arrangement, this court said in Crawford v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 183, 192\n, 53 S. L. ed. 465, 469, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 260, 15 Ann. Cas. 392: 'Its almost necessary result, if carried out, would be to defraud the United States. The fraud might be perpetrated by getting the contract at a higher price than otherwise would have been obtained, or, if already obtained, then the United States might be defrauded by the general superintendent [ Machen] accepting improper satchels, not made of the materials or in the manner specified in the contract, or by his requiring the delivery of more satchels than were sufficient for the wants of the Department. . . . Such a corrupt agreement, if \n\n[240 U.S. 74, 81]\n\u00a0\n carried out, would naturally, if not necessarily, result in defrauding the United States by causing it to pay more for satchels than was necessary, or for more satchels, or possibly inferior ones, than it otherwise would, but for the corrupt agreement set forth.'\n Of course, the secret arrangement with Machen operated to vitiate the company's contract, and justified the Postmaster General in rescinding it on discovering the fraud.

And this is so, even though the company was without actual knowledge of the corrupt arrangement. It was made by Lorenz and Crawford while endeavoring to secure the contract for the company and was a means to that end. They were the company's agents and were securing the contract at its request. It accepted the fruits of their efforts and thereby sanctioned what they did, and made their knowledge its own. Krumm v. Beach, 96 N. Y. 398, 404; Fairchild v. McMahon, 139 N. Y. 290, 36 Am.

Whether requisite proof was made of the value of the satchels as furnished is another \n\n[240 U.S. 74, 82]\n\u00a0\n question. The court of claims made no finding of their value, and, in explanation of this, said that there was 'a complete absence' of evidence upon the subject. The burden of proof was with the claimant, and, if he failed to carry it, he is not in a position to complain,-especially as it appears that the government seasonably objected that he had not proved the value. He insists, however, that the findings show the price at which the government contracted to take the satchels with the shoulder straps, and also what it cost the government to supply the straps, and that the difference should be regarded, in the absence of other evidence, as representing the value of the satchels as furnished,-that is, without the straps. The insistence proceeds upon the theory that the contract price was in the nature of an admission by the government of the value of the satchels with the straps. However this might be in other circumstances, it is wholly inadmissible here, for the fraud with which the contract was tainted completely discredited the contract price, and prevented it from being treated as an admission of the value by the government. It therefore was incumbent upon the claimant to show the value by other evidence, and, as this was not done, no recovery could be had upon a quantum valebat.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Holmes dissent, being of opinion that the case should be remanded for findings on the question of value.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCROSS v. U S(1916)\nNo. 78\nArgued: Decided: November 13, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. Frank B. Crosthwaite and Edward F. Colladay for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question for decision is, did the court below err in rejecting the claim of the plaintiff, who is the appellant, \n\n[242 U.S. 4, 5]\n\u00a0\n to recover an amount based upon his asserted right as clerk of the United States district and circuit courts for the district of Rhode Island to be paid fees for making, on the direction of the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, triplicate copies of original declarations of intention for naturalization, and attaching the seal of the court to the same?\n The solution of the inquiry depends upon a consideration of  12, 13, and 21 of the Naturalization Act of June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 596, chap. 3592, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4371, 4372, 4377), and the relation to those provisions of  828, Revised Statutes, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1383\n\n\n By  12 it is provided that it shall be the duty of the clerk of every court exercising jurisdiction in naturalization matters 'to keep and file a duplicate of each declaration of intention made before him and to send to the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization at Washington, within thirty days after the issuance of a certificate of citizenship, a duplicate of such certificate, and to make and keep on file in his office a stub for each certificate so issued by him. . . . It shall also be the duty of the clerk of each of said courts to report to the said Bureau, within thirty days after the final hearing and decision of the court, the name of each and every alien who shall be denied naturalization, and to furnish to said Bureau duplicates of all petitions within thirty days after the filing of the same, and certified copies of such other proceedings and orders instituted in or issued out of said court affecting or relating to the naturalization of aliens as may be required from time to time by the said Bureau.'\n By  13 provision is made for the following fees: 'For receiving and filing a declaration of intention and issuing a duplicate thereof, one dollar. For making, filing, and docketing the petition of an alien for admission as a citizen of the United States and for the final hearing thereon, two dollars; and for entering the final order and the issuance \n\n[242 U.S. 4, 6]\n\u00a0\n of the certificate of citizenship thereunder, if granted, two dollars.'\n In their ultimate analysis all the arguments for reversal must come to one or the other or both of the following propositions: (a) That the declarations of intention were not proceedings in naturalization covered by  12, and therefore the services rendered were outside of that section, and governed, not by the enumeration of fees in  13, but by the general provisions of  828, Rev. Stat. Comp. Stat. 1913,  1383, authorizing a charge by clerks of 10 cents per folio 'for a copy of any entry or record, or of any paper on file,' and a fee of 20 cents 'for affixing the seal of the court to any instrument, when required.' Or (b) if the declarations of intention of which triplicate copies were furnished were proceedings in naturalization and within the requirements of  12, payment for such copies was not embraced by the fees enumerated in 13, and therefore the charge for them must be considered as being provided for in  828, Rev. Stat. Comp. Stat. 1913,  1383.\n But we are of opinion that both of these propositions are incompatible with  12 and 13, and, moreover, that to sanction them would disregard the express prohibition of  21, which is as follows:\n'That it shall be unlawful for any clerk of any court of his authorized deputy or assistant exercising jurisdiction in naturalization proceedings, or to demand, charge, collect, or receive any other of additional fees or moneys in naturalization proceedings save the fees and moneys herein specified.'\n\n We are of opinion the conclusion stated clearly follows from the the prohibition of this section for the following reasons: First, if, on the one hand, it be assumed that the duty to furnish the copies charged for was expressly commanded by  12, the right to charge for them would be clearly prohibited by  21, even if no provision for payment was embraced in the fees enumerated in  13; \n\n[242 U.S. 4, 7]\n\u00a0\n since it is apparent from the text that the purpose of the statute was to permit fees to be charged for the services expressly provided for in  12 only when such fees were enumerated and authorized by  13,-a conclusion which is additionally apparent since  12 unmistakably imposes duties for which no fees are provided in  13, but which are covered by the prohibition of  21. Second, if, on the other hand, it be assumed that there is no express provision for furnishing the copies in  12, but that such duty only arose in consequence of the general provision of that section requiring clerks to furnish 'certified copies of such other proceedings and orders instituted in or issued out of said court affecting or relating to the naturalization of aliens as may be required from time to time by the said Bureau,' it is equally clear that the prohibition of  21 would be applicable, since it was plainly intended to prevent resort to extraneous legislation for the purpose of supporting the right to charge a fee for services embraced within the general terms of  12 when no fee was provided for such services by  13.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCUBBINS v. MISSISSIPPI RIVER COMMISION(1916)\nNo. 299\nArgued: April 24, 1916Decided: June 5, 1916\n\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 351, 353]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Barnette E. Moses for appellant.\n\n\n[241 U.S. 351, 357]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Gerald Fitz Gerald, Solicitor General Davis, and Mr. Robert Szold for appellees.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 351, 358]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The conditions out of which this controversy arises are substantially the same as those which were relied upon in Jackson v. United States, \n230 U.S. 1\n, 57 L. ed. 1363, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1011. We therefore here make a briefer statement of the topography of the country with which the case is concerned, and of the other general conditions involved, than we would do if such were not the case, since, if a fuller statement as to any particular aspect is desired, it can be readily found by a reference to the report of that case.\n The complainant, as the owner of a piece of land on the east bank of the Mississippi river, adjacent to Memphis, \n\n[241 U.S. 351, 359]\n\u00a0\n Tennessee, on his own behalf and on behalf of others owning similar land in the same locality, commenced this suit against the Mississippi River Commission and fifteen local state levee boards operating on the river between Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and the mouth of the river at the Gulf of Mexico, three of these boards being organized under the laws of Missouri, four under the law of Arkansas, one under that of Tennessee, one under the law of Mississippi, and six under the law of Louisiana.\n It was alleged that in flood seasons, when the water in the Mississippi river rose above its natural low-water banks, such water would flow out and over the vast basins in which the alluvial valley between Cape Girardeau and the Gulf formed itself, and would then, either by percolation gradually flow back into the river, or be carried over and through the basins by the streams flowing through them into the Gulf of Mexico, where such streams emptied. It was further alleged that the land of the complainant, when the river in the flood periods was thus permitted to discharge its waters, was so situated that it was beyond the reach of overflow from the river. It was then alleged that in 1883 the Mississippi River Commission, acting under the authority of Congress, had devised a plan known as the Eads Plan, by which it was contemplated that on both banks of the river, except at certain places, which were stated, a line of embankment or levees would be built which, in times of high water or flood, would hold the water relatively within the lines of the low-water banks, thus improving navigation by causing the water to deepen the bed, and saving the country behind the levees from inundation. It was averred that, to further this plan, the various state levee boards, which were made defendants, were organized, and that all of them, within the scope of their power and the limits of their financial ability, had aided in carrying on this work, and that, as the result of their work and of the levees built by the Mississippi \n\n[241 U.S. 351, 360]\n\u00a0\n River Commission, it had come to pass that from Cairo to the Gulf, a distance of about 1,050 miles, on both sides of the river, except at points which were stated, there was a continuous line of levee restraining the water from flowing out into the basins, as above stated, and which, in many instances, cut off the outlets connecting the streams which drained the basins and ultimately carried off the water to the Gulf. It was charged that this line of levees as a whole had been virtually adopted by the Mississippi River Commission, which body had assumed control of the whole subject, and that such body and all the state agencies co-operating were engaged in strengthening, elevating, reviewing, repairing, and increasing the lines of levee so as to more effectually accomplish the purpose in view.\n It was charged 'that the effect of the closing by the defendants of the natural outlets along the said river, and the confining of the flood waters between the levee system as a whole, is to obstruct the natural high-water flow of the water of said river in and along its natural bed for its entire length, thereby raising the level of the water to such an extent that said flood waters, within the last five years, have attained a sufficient height to flow over complainant's land, and when there is now a high-water stage in said river, the waters of said river accumulate, flow over, and remain standing upon and over said lands of complainant to a depth of from 4 to 8 feet, so that complainant is now being interrupted in the profitable use, occupation, and enjoyment of his said land.' And it was further alleged that 'said land is being covered with superinduced additions of sand, silt, and gravel, now from 6 inches to 3 feet in depth; the houses and fences thereon are being washed away, rendering the said land and the houses thereon unfit for occupancy, driving away the tenants, doing irreparable harm and injury to said land, impairing its usefulness, \n\n[241 U.S. 351, 361]\n\u00a0\n causing the practical destruction thereof, and destroying its market value.'\n It was averred that to obstruct the river as alleged was a violation of the legal rights of the complainant, since he was entitled to the natural flow of the river within its natural high or low-water bed, free from interference by the acts of the defendants. Averring that no proceedings had been taken to expropriate the land, and that no offer to pay for the same had been made, and that the acts complained of constituted a taking without compensation, in violation of due process of law under the Constitution of the United States, and that there was no adequate remedy at law, the prayer was for an injunction against the Mississippi River Commission and all its officers, employees, agents, and contractors, wherever found, and against all the local levee boards and their officers, employees, agents, and contractors, perpetually prohibiting them from further building any levees, from enlarging, strengthening, repairing, or doing any act to maintain the levees already built, and for general relief.\n The bill was amended by alleging that the overflow of complainant's land, as averred, instead of having happened within five years, had occurred within one year, and the original prayer was added to by asking that if it was found that the injunction prayed could not be granted, the case be transferred from the equity to the law side, and be converted into a law action to recover from the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee Board, the local Mississippi board which alone of the defendants had been served, the sum of $500,000 as the value of the plantation alleged to have been wrongfully taken.\n A motion by that corporation was made to dismiss the bill on the ground that it stated no basis for relief, and in any event it alleged no ground for equitable jurisdiction, since at best, upon the theory that a cause of action was \n\n[241 U.S. 351, 362]\n\u00a0\n stated, there was plainly an adequate remedy at law. On the hearing the motion to dismiss was joined in by the Mississippi River Commission, and the case is here as the result of the action of the court below in dismissing the bill for want of equity.\n At the threshold we put out of view as primarily negligible contentions as to whether, in any event, in view of the vast public interests which would have been detrimentally affected, the injunction prayed could have been granted, and whether the suit should not have been dismissed so far as the Mississippi River Commission was concerned, on the ground that it was really a suit against the United States without its consent, and not a mere action against individuals acting as officers, to prevent them from violating the rights of the complainant by taking his property without compensation. We say these contentions are negligible because underlying them all is the fundamental issue whether, under the averments of the bill, there was any right to relief whatever, and to that decisive question we come. Its solution involves deciding whether the complainant, as an owner of land fronting on the river, had a right to complain of the building of levees along the banks of the river for the purpose of containing the water in times of flood within the river, and preventing it from spreading out from the river into and over the alluvial valley through which the river flows to its destination in the Gulf, even although it resulted that the effect of thus keeping the water within the river was, by increasing its volume, to so raise its level as to cause it to overflow the complainant's land.\n While we are of the opinion that in substance a negative answer to the proposition must follow from applying to this case the doctrines which were upheld in Jackson v. United States, \n230 U.S. 1\n, 57 L. ed. 1363, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1011, and Hughes v. United States, 230 U. S. p. 24, 57 L. ed. 1374, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 624, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1019, as the unsoundness of the distinctions attempted in the argument to be drawn between those cases and this, \n\n[241 U.S. 351, 363]\n\u00a0\n and the decisive application of those cases to this, will be more readily appreciated by a recurrence to the legal principles by which the controversy is to be governed, we address ourselves to that subject, looking at it in a twofold aspect: First, with reference to the rights and obligations of the landowners and the power of the state to deal with the subject; and second, with reference to the power of United States to erect levees to confine the water for the purpose of improving navigation, as superimposed on the right of the landowners or that of the state authorities to construct such levees, if such right obtains, and if not, as independently existing in virtue of the dominant power to improve navigation vested in Congress under the Constitution.\n\n 1. \nWithout seeking to state or embrace the whole field of the Roman law concerning the flow of water, whether surface or subterranean, or to trace the general differences between that law, if any, as it existed in the ancient law of the continent of Europe, whether customary or written, or as it prevailed in France prior to, and now exists in, the Code Napoleon, one thing may be taken as beyond dispute, that not only under the Roman law, but under all the others, the free flow of water in rivers was secured from undue interruption, and the respective riparian proprietors, in consequence of their right to enjoy the same, were protected from undue interference or burden created by obstructions to the flow, by deflections in its course, or any other act limiting the right to enjoy the flow, or causing additional burdens by changing it. But while this was universally true, a limitation to the rule was also universally recognized by which individuals, in case of accidental or extraordinary floods, were entitled to erect such works as would protect them from the consequences of the flood by restraining the same, and that no other riparian owner was entitled to complain of such action upon the ground of injury inflicted thereby, because all, as the result of the \n\n[241 U.S. 351, 364]\n\u00a0\n accidental and extraordinary condition, were entitled to the enjoyment of the common right to construct works for their own protection.\n Demolombe after commenting upon article 640 of the Code Napoleon generally dealing with the servitudes arising from the flow of water, and pointing out that, under the Roman law as well as under the ancient French law and the Code Napoleon, it was the duty of proprietors whose lands bordered upon or were traversed by rivers to permit the water of such rivers to flow their natural course unimpeded, and quoting the Roman law, fluminis naturalem cursum non avertere (L. 1, Cod. de Alluvionibus), additionally states that under both the Roman and ancient law and under the Code Napoleon such proprietors were bound 'to undertake to do no work the result of which would be to change the direction of the stream or enlarge its bed, or to injure in any manner other proprietors whose lands border upon or are traversed by the stream' (Demolombe, vol. 11, No. 30, p. 36). But the author at once proceeds to add that the principles thus stated in no way serve to prevent or to limit the right of proprietors whose lands border on or are traversed by rivers 'from guarantying themselves against damage by defensive works, constructed either upon the border of the rivers or in the interior of their property, against either the permanent and insensible action of the rivers or streams, or particularly against the damage caused by the accidental or extraordinary overflow of their banks; Ripam suam adversus rapidi amnis impetum munire prohibitum non est (L. 1, Cod. de Alluv.).' And proceeding, the author states that this right of the proprietors undoubtedly exists 'even when the effect of the dikes or other works done will be, as is nearly always the case, to render the waters of the river more hostile and damaging to other properties, the owners of which would have no cause of complaint because each one is entitled to do the same in his own behalf, \n\n[241 U.S. 351, 365]\n\u00a0\n as the right of preservation and of legitimate defense is reciprocal, since it is impossible to conceive that the law would impose upon the proprietors bordering upon streams an obligation to suffer their property to be devoured [by accidental or extraordinary overflows] without the power on their part to do anything to protect themselves against the disaster.' Proceeding to elucidate and state the limitations by which the right thus universally recognized is safeguarded, the author says: 'It is necessary, however, that the works constructed [for the purposes stated] do not encroach upon the natural bed of the water courses, that they should be of course constructed in conformity to the police regulations, if any exist, and finally, that they are in fact constructed by those who build them for the defense of their own property, because constructions would not be tolerated which had been erected by a proprietor upon his own land without any necessity whatever for his own protection, but with the only and disloyal purpose of injuring the property of others.' Demolombe further states: 'What I have just said of streams and rivers is equally applicable to accidental torrents of water, which, like avalanches, may sometimes precipitate themselves upon certain properties. Such a case is likewise one of vis major, against which each one has a right, by the natural law, on his own behalf to seek to protect himself as best he may,- a right which, as well said by the court of Aix, is like that which obtains to resist the incursion of an enemy, without being preoccupied as to what may be the result or the wrong suffered by a neighbor who may not have had the foresight to successfully avoid the disaster.' The author then proceeds: 'These principles, which are sustained both by reason and by conceptions of equity, have been for all time recognized both in the Roman law and in our ancient French jurisprudence. They are to-day supported by the unanimous accord of the decided cases and of the opinions of authors. (Comp.

Ann. 1359, where some of the authors referred to by Demolombe and others are quoted, and one or more of the adjudged French cases enforcing the limitation are stated and commented upon.\n That the general right to an unrestrained flow of rivers and streams, and the duty not to unduly deflect or change the same by works constructed for individual benefit, as qualified by the limitation as to accidental and extraordinary floods which prevailed in Rome and on the Continent, and which today govern in France, as stated by Demolombe, also obtained in Scotland, was recognized in 1741, in the case of Farquharson v. Farquharson, Morison's Dict. 12,779. And the character of the limitation of the rule is well illustrated by Menzies v. Breadalbane, 3 Bligh, N. R. 414 (H. L.), where it was held that it did not apply to a case where a structure was erected in the established high-water channel of a stream. It is apparent also from the opinions in Nield v. London & N. W. R. Co. L. R. 10 Exch. 4, 44 L. J. Exch. N. S. 15, 23 Week. Rep. 60, 23 Eng. Rul. Cas. 756, and the statement found in Coulson on the Law of Waters, 3d. ed. pages 177 et seq., that the limitation as to accidental and extraordinary overflows likewise exists in England.\n In this country it is also certain, without going into a review of decided cases, that the limitation is recognized, although it is true to say that much contrariety and confusion exist in the adjudged cases as to when it is applicable, some cases extending the rule so far as to virtually render the limitation inoperative, others extending the \n\n[241 U.S. 351, 367]\n\u00a0\n limitation to such a degree as really to cause it to abrogate the rule itself. But into these differences and contrarieties it is not at all necessary to enter, since there is no decided case, whatever may be the difference as to the application of the limitation, holding that it does not exist, and when in fact the very statement of the general rule requires it to be determined whether that rule as correctly stated would include situations which the limitation, if recognized, would exclude. We place in the margin a few of the many adjudged cases from which the situation just stated will be made manifest. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Were the overflows in this case accidental and extraordinary? is, then, the proposition to which the case reduces itself. That the volume of water from the vast watershed which the Mississippi river drains, and which, by means of percolation and tributaries, reaches that river, is susceptible now and again of being so simultaneously drained off from the watershed into the river, and thus so vastly increasing the amount of water to be carried off in a given time as to cause the overflow of the valley which the river traverses, and to thereby endanger the enormous interests concerned, is too well known to require anything but statement. But that the possibilities of such a result do not, when such overflows occur, cause them to be not accidental, is, to say the least, persuasively established by the ruling in Viterbo v. Friedlander, \n120 U.S. 707\n, 30 L. ed. 776, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 962. And leaving aside this view, it is obvious from the situation and the causes which, in the nature of things, may accidentally bring about the emptying into the river at one and the same time of the volumes of water from all the vast sources of supply which drain the expansive watershed \n\n[241 U.S. 351, 368]\n\u00a0\n into the river, in the absence of which accidental unison there could be no flood, that the accidental character of the unity of the conditions upon which the flood depends serves to affix that character to the result,- the flood itself. But assuming, as we think it must be assumed, that the words 'accidental' and 'extraordinary' are to be taken as relating to the river,-that is, as alone embracing conditions not usually there occurring, and not ordinary to the stream in its usual condition, having regard to the flow through its natural bed, whether in high or low water,-that view would be here irrelevant, since there is no suggestion of any bed of the river in high or low water except the space between the natural banks along which the levees were built, unless the whole valley be considered as such bed. Indeed, from the face of the bill it is apparent that the rights relied upon were assumed to exist upon the theory that the valley through which the river travels, in all its length and vast expanse, with its great population, its farms, its villages, its towns, its cities, its schools, its colleges, its universities, its manufactories, its network of railroads,-some of them transcontinental,-are virtually to be considered from a legal point of view as constituting merely the high-water bed of the river, and therefore subject, without any power to protect, to be submitted to the destruction resulting from the overflow by the river of its natural banks. In fact, the nature of the assumption upon which the argument rests, is shown by the contention that the building of the levees under the circumstances disclosed was a work, not of preservation, but of reclamation; that is, a work not to keep the water within the bed of the river, for the purpose of preventing destruction to the valley lying beyond its bed and banks, but to reclaim all the vast area of the valley from the peril to which it was subjected by being situated in the high- water bed of the river. If it were necessary to say anything more to demonstrate the unsoundness of this view, \n\n[241 U.S. 351, 369]\n\u00a0\n it would suffice to point out that the assumption is wholly irreconcilable with the settlement and development of the valley of the river, that it is at war with the action of all the state governments having authority over the territory, and is a complete denial of the legislative reasons which necessarily were involved in the action of Congress creating the Mississippi River Commission, and appropriating millions of dollars to improve the river by building levees along the banks in order to confine the waters of the river within its natural banks, and, by increasing the volume of water, to improve the navigable capacity of the river.\n\n 2. \nAlthough, in view of the conclusion just stated, it is unnecessary to refer to the power of Congress to build the levees under the paramount authority vested in it to improve the navigation of the river, we cannot fail to point out the complete demonstration which that power affords of all want of legal responsibility to the complainant for the building of the levees complained of. In this connection it is to be observed that the complete application of this power is, in the reason of things, admitted by the erroneous assumption upon which alone the arguments proceed in seeking to avoid the effect of the well-defined limitation as to accidental and extraordinary floods; that is, the erroneous contention as to the highwater bed of the river, which we have disposed of. We say this, since it is apparent that if the property in the valley were to be treated as in the bed of the river, that would be true also of the property of the complainant, hence, causing it to come to pass that, as to such property, so situated, there would be no possible lawful ground of complaint to arise from the action of Congress in exerting its lawful power over the bed of the river for the improvement of navigation.\n These conclusions dispose of the case without the necessity of recurring, as we proposed at the outset to do, \n\n[241 U.S. 351, 370]\n\u00a0\n to the rulings in the Jackson and Hughes Case, but, in the light of the principles we have stated, we direct attention to the fact that the attempt to distinguish the Jackson Case upon the ground that relief was there denied because the proprietor on one side of the river, who complained of the increase of the flood level and injury to his land from the levees erected on the other side, or from the levee system as a whole, had himself erected a levee to protect his property, and therefore was estopped, is without foundation. It is plain when the context of the opinion in the Jackson Case is considered, that the denial of the right to relief in that case was rested not upon the conception that a right existing on one side of the river was destroyed by estoppel, and a right not existing on the other was conferred by the same principle, but upon the broad ground that the rights of both owners on either side embraced the authority, without giving rise to legal injury to the other, to protect themselves from the harm to result from the accidental and extraordinary floods occurring in the river, by building levees, if they so desired. Additionally, when the principle laid down in the Jackson Case is illustrated by the ruling which was made in the Hughes Case, it becomes apparent that the contention here urged as to the identity between the great valley and the flood bed of the river was adversely disposed of, since under no view could the ruling in the Hughes Case have been made except upon the theory that the bank of the river was where it was found, and did not extend over a vast and imaginary area.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice Pitney concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Burwell v.

It alleges that the plaintiff was incorporated under the laws of Ohio for the purpose of generating hydroelectric power by means of dams and canals upon the said river, and of disposing of the same; that it has adopted surveys, maps, plans, and profiles to that end, has entered upon, located, and defined the property rights required, has instituted condemnation proceedings to acquire a part at least of such property, has sold bonds and spent large sums and has gained a paramount right to the water and necessary land. The bill also alleges that the city has passed an ordinance appropriating the water, and directing its solicitor to take proceedings in court for the assessment of the compensation to be paid. The district court dismissed the bill for want of jurisdiction on the ground that it presented no Federal question, because, if the plaintiff had any rights, they could be appropriated only by paying for them in pursuance of the verdict of a jury and a judgment of a court. It made the statutory certificate, and the case comes here by direct appeal. 210 Fed. 524.\n It appears to us that sufficient attention was not paid to other allegations of the bill. After setting out various passages from the statutes and Constitution of Ohio, and concluding that the city has no constitutional power to take the property and franchises that the plaintiff is alleged to own, or any property for a water supply, it alleges that the city does not intend to institute any proceedings against the plaintiff, but intends to take its property \n\n[240 U.S. 462, 464]\n\u00a0\n and rights without compensation; that it is building a dam and has taken steps that will destroy the plaintiff's rights; that it is insolvent; that the purpose of the ordinance and certain statutes referred to is to appropriate and destroy those rights without compensation; that the defendant purports to be acting under the ordinance, and that in so acting it violates art. I.,  10, and the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. It is established that such action is to be regarded as the action of the state. Raymond v.

The property was in custodia legis and was sold without leave of court. Because of this the court held the sales invalid, and entered a decree canceling the certificates of purchase, and enjoining the county treasurer from issuing tax deeds thereon. Thus far there is no room to complain. Wiswall v. Sampson, 14 How. 52, 14 L. ed. 322; Barton v. Barbour, \n104 U.S. 126\n, 26 L. ed. 672; Re Tyler, \n149 U.S. 164\n, 37 L. ed. 689, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 785; Re Eppstein, 17 L.R.A.(N.S.) 465, 84 C. C. A. 208, 156 Fed. 42. The court further directed in its decree that the several tracts be sold by the trustee free from any lien for the taxes and assessments, and that the holders of the certificates of purchase be severally reimbursed out of the proceeds of the respective tracts, but not out of the general assets, for the taxes and special assessments paid thereon, with the interest and penalties which accrued prior to the time the trustee took possession. Upon appeal to the court of appeals, that court modified the decree by requiring that the certificate holders be reimbursed for the amounts paid at such sales and for subsequent taxes, together with interest thereon, 'as provided by the laws of Colorado on redemption from tax sales of land,' the same to be paid 'out of the general fund, regardless of the amount which the property may bring at bakruptcy sale.' 137 C. C. A. 35, 220 Fed. 441.\n The trustee urges, first, that the certificate holders should not be reimbursed at all; second, that, if reimbursed, they should not be allowed any interest or penalties other than such as accrued prior to the time when the trustee qualified and took possession; and, third, that they should not be reimbursed out of the general \n\n[241 U.S. 588, 590]\n\u00a0\n assets, but only out of the proceeds of the trustee's sale of the tracts for which they severally had certificates.\n Considering the plain provision in  64a of the bankruptcy act, that 'the court shall order the trustee to pay all taxes legally due and owing by the bankrupt . . . in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors' [ 30 Stat. at L. 563, chap. 541, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9648], we entertain no doubt of the propriety of requiring that the certificate holders, who had paid the taxes and assessments at the sales, be reimbursed upon the cancelation of their certificates, or of requiring that the reimbursement be out of the general assets. The taxes and assessments were not merely charges upon the tracts that were sold, but against the general estate as well.\n And while we are of opinion that the certificate holders were entitled to interest upon the amounts paid, at the ordinary legal rate, applicable in the absence of an express contract, we think they were not entitled to the larger interest required to be paid on redemption from tax sales. They were not in a position to stand upon the terms of the redemption statute, for the sales were invalid, and the only recognition which they could ask was such as resulted from an application of equitable principles to their situation. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is modified to conform to what is here said respecting the allowance of interest.

It has been before this court in the first aspect (\n201 U.S. 303\n, 50 L. ed. 765, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485), and now comes here on matters affecting the division of property, beginning with the fundamental objection that the division could not be asked in the divorce suit, but must proceed on the footing of a decree already made. As to this it is enough to say that no such error was assigned as a ground for appeal, and the objection comes too late. At the previous stage the right of the plaintiff to her proportion of the conjugal property, to alimony pending suit, and to other allowances claimed, was said to be the basis of our jurisdiction. \n201 U.S. 318\n. De Villanueva v. Villanueva, \n239 \nU.S. 293, 294\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 109. The court of first instance had jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and the separation or union of the two causes was merely a question of procedure and convenience. The defendant im- \n\n[241 U.S. 154, 158]\n\u00a0\n pliedly admitted the jurisdiction by pleading that there was no common property, and that 'therefore' the separation should be denied. After the matter had been adverted to by the trial judge and the joinder declared proper, it was dealt with as legitimate by the supreme court, and upon a petition for rehearing the only objections urged by the defendant concerned matters of detail. There is every reason that the local practice sanctioned in this case by the local courts should not be disturbed.\n The next error alleged in argument also was not assigned. It is that Judge Norris, who first heard the evidence, having resigned, Judge McCabe, of the court of first instance, who finally decided the separation of conjugal property, was designated by Judge Ross (before whom otherwise the case would have come), on the ground that the latter was disqualified; and that Judge Ross had no power to do so under the Code of Civil Procedure then in force. Upon this point again we should not disturb the course adopted by the local tribunals without stronger reasons than are offered here, and therefore do not discuss the question at length. The parties could have agreed in writing upon a judge, and they did agree in writing at a later stage that Judge McCabe should decide the case without waiting for the action of the assessors whom the law provides to assist upon matters of fact. This objection, like the preceding, seems not to have been even suggested to the supreme court of the Philippines. To listen to it now would be not to prevent, but to accomplish, an injustice not to be tolerated except under the most peremptory requirement of law.\n The next point argued, again not assigned as error, is that it seems from the opinion of the judge of first instance that the trial was had upon the evidence that had been offered before Judge Norris. If we are to assume the fact, it is a most extraordinary suggestion that, even though the parties seem to have assented to the course \n\n[241 U.S. 154, 159]\n\u00a0\n pursued, due process of law forbids a hearing upon a transcript of evidence formerly heard in court. We shall say no more upon this point.\n The errors that were assigned may be disposed of with equal brevity. The first one is the taking of July 5, 1902, the date of the decree of divorce, afterwards affirmed, as the date for liquidating the wife's claim. It is urged that there was no formal decree of separation of the property, and that until such an order had been made the court had no right to enter a judgment. It also is argued that there was no such inventory as was required by law. But the testimony and other evidence are not before us, and, apart from our often-stated unwillingness to interfere with matters of local administration unless clear and important error is shown, there is nothing in the record sufficient to control the opinion of the supreme court of the Islands that 'the method adopted by [the judge of first instance] in liquidating the assets of the conjugal partnership was substantially in accord with the method prescribed in the Code.' [25 Philippine, 445.] We disallow the attempt to reopen some questions of detail, such as a charge of estimated profits, upon this and other grounds. See Piza Hermanos v. Caldentey, \n231 U.S. 690\n, 58 L. ed. 439, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 253.\n The only remaining item is charging interest on the judgment from July 5, 1902. But that was the date at which, but for the delays of the law, the wife would have received her dues, the husband has had the use of the money meanwhile, and we are not prepared to say that it was not at least within the discretion of the court to allow the charge, notwithstanding the success of the husband in reducing the amount on appeal.

The railroad company answered, and, after a hearing, the court granted the writ, subject to a condition presently to be stated. 178 Mich. 230, 144 N. W. 696.\n The Commission's action was invoked by a complaint presented by the Fletcher Paper Company, of which the railway company had due notice. Before the Commission the railway company insisted that the logging spur was not a part of its railroad system, and that its use had been only that of a private convenience; but the Commission concluded from the pleadings and evidence that the fact was otherwise, and made the order with the purpose of correcting what it deemed an unreasonable and unjust discrimination and an inadequate service within the meaning of the local statute (3 Howell's Anno. Stat. 2d ed.  6526, 6537, 6545). Thereupon the railway compnay filed a bill in equity in the circuit court of Wayne county, praying that the order be vacated, and asking that its enforcement be temporarily and permanently enjoined. In the bill the railway company repeated its insistence \n\n[240 U.S. 564, 567]\n\u00a0\n that the logging spur was not a part of its railroad system, but only a private convenience, and charged that an adequate hearing was denied by the Commission in that the issues were determined upon the evidence presented by the paper company, and in contravention of an understanding, assented to by the Commission, that if an objection of the railway company in the nature of a plea of res judicata should be overruled, as it afterwards was, the company would be afforded a further opportunity to present evidence in opposition to that of the paper company. The bill invoked the due process of law clause of the 14th Amendment. Apparently the prayer for a temporary injunction was not insisted upon.\n It was during the pendency of that suit that the mandamus proceeding was begun and carried to judgment in the supreme court. In this proceeding the railway company again asserted that the logging spur was only a private convenience, and not a part of the railroad system used by it as a common carrier, and that the Commission had denied it an adequate opportunity to be heard upon that question, and further insisted that to require it to give effect to the Commission's order in advance of a hearing and decision upon that question in the suit in equity would deprive it of the due process of law guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.\n In the course of its opinion the supreme court said, pp. 243-246:\n'We are not called upon to consider and determine the merits of the controversy between the Fletcher Paper Company and respondent railway company upon the order of August 3, 1911. Such questions are involved in the case now pending before the circuit court for the county of Wayne, in chancery, wherein the respondent railway company seeks to review, annul, and set aside said order. The sole question before this court in this proceeding is whether the order of the Railroad Commission shall \n\n[240 U.S. 564, 568]\n\u00a0\n take effect and become operative pending the hearing and determination of that chancery cause. . . .\n\n'Pelative to an order made by this Commission, this court has said: ' . . . Its orders stand until modified or set aside by it or by the courts . . . . Presumptively, the findings and orders of the Commission are right. If attacked, the complainant has the burden of showing 'by clear and satisfactory evidence that the order of the Commission complained of is unlawful or unreasonable, as the case may be.\" Detroit & M. R. Co. v. Michigan R. Commission, 171 Mich. 335, 346, 137 N. W. 329.\n\n ... * *\n'The petitioner in the instant case before the Railroad Commission offered, and upon this hearing before this court keeps such offer good, to indemnify respondent for all costs and expenses incurred in re-laying the track taken up by it, with interest; and to pay all rates that may be fixed or charged by the railway company and approved by the Commission, in case this order is vacated and set aside by the Wayne circuit court in chancery, or by this court, if an appeal is taken. This indemnity would save respondent harmless from any possible loss in complying with the order, and save petitioner from claimed irreparable damage to 21,000,000 feet of forest products during the probable term of years occupied in this litigation.\n\n'It has been held by this court that an order of the Railroad Commission is enforceable by mandamus, although a proceeding in equity to review it is pending. Michigan R. Commission v. Michigan C. R. Co. 159 Mich. 580, 124 N. W. 564.\n\n'This order is prima facie not unreasonable. There is no question but that the legislative intent, clearly expressed in this statute, was that the orders of the Commission should be and continue in force during all subsequent proceedings until modified or set aside by the Commission or by the courts.\n\n'The statute provides a remedy by mandamus to enforce \n\n[240 U.S. 564, 569]\n\u00a0\n the orders of the Commission, and this court has granted such writs. Upon the facts presented, the writ should be granted in this case.\n\n'Upon furnishing bond by the petitioner before the Railroad Commission, the Fletcher Paper Company, in the penal sum of $10,000 to indemnify respondent in manner and form as herein stated, with two sureties, to be agreed upon between the parties, or approved by the clerk of this court, a writ of mandamus will issue as prayed.'\n\n And in the course of a separate opinion one of the justices said, p. 248:\n'So long as the respondent was operating the spur, accepting thereon and transporting over it freight for those who offered it, and so long as it published tariffs affecting such service, it was undoubtedly, as to such operations, within the scope of the act in question, and this we held in Detroit & M. R. Co. v. Michigan R. Commission, 171 Mich. 335, 137 N. W. 329. But whether the Michigan Railroad Commission has power under the statute to require respondent to continue to operate such a spur, or branch, against its will, and in face of its efforts to abandon it, is quite a different question. It is a question which we assume is presented in the pending chancery proceeding to set aside the order which in this proceeding is sought to be enforced. It need not be answered now.'\n\n The local statute, 3 Howell's Anno. Stat. 2d ed., provides: ( 6545) Orders of the Commission shall take effect and become operative twenty days after service; ( 6547) the Commission may, upon application, rescind or alter any order; ( 6548) all regulations, practices, and services prescribed by the Commission shall be in force and be prima facie lawful and reasonable until finally held otherwise in a suit brought for the purpose under  6549, or until rescinded or altered by the Commission under  6547; ( 6549) a carrier may, within thirty days after notice of an order, commence a suit in equity to vacate \n\n[240 U.S. 564, 570]\n\u00a0\n it, the burden being upon the carrier to show that the order is unlawful or unreasonable. In such a suit original evidence may be introduced in addition to the transcript of that presented before the Commission; and if evidence be introduced by the carrier which is different from or in addition to that presented before the Commission, the court, unless the parties stipulate to the contrary, shall transmit a copy thereof to the Commission and stay further proceedings for the time being. The Commission shall consider the evidence transmitted, and may alter or rescind its order, and shall report its action to the court. If the Commission rescind its order, the suit shall be dismissed; if it alter the order, the same in its changed form shall take the place of the original, and judgment shall be rendered thereon as though the last action of the Commission had been taken at first; ( 6570) in addition to all other remedies, the Commission, and likewise any party in interest, may compel compliance with an order of the Commission by a proceeding in mandamus, injunction, or other appropriate civil remedy.\n It will be perceived that the supreme court, applying the statute, held that the 'sole question' for decision was whether the Commission's order should be given effect pending the determination of the equity suit; and then, coming to dispose of that question, held that due regard for the provisions of the statute, especially  6545, 6548, and 6549, and for the relative consequences of enforcing or refusing to enforce the order, required that it be enforced by mandamus, if a suitable bond was given to indemnify the railway company for any resulting loss in the event the order ultimately should be vacated in the equity suit.\n Our jurisdiction is called in question upon the ground that the judgment is not final in the sense of  237, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1214], upon which our power to review depends, because the judgment does not determine the merits and end the \n\n[240 U.S. 564, 571]\n\u00a0\n litigation. But, as this court has said, 'all judgments and decrees which determine the particular cause' are final in the sense of the statute. Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 463-465, 7 L. ed. 481, 486, 487; Central Transp. Co. v. Pullman's Car Co. \n139 \nU.S. 24, 40\n, 35 S. L. ed. 55, 61, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478; Mt. Vernon-Woodberry Cotton Duck Co. v. Alabama Interstate Power Co. \n240 U.S. 30\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 234. This view has prevailed through a century of practices in reviewing judgments and decrees dismissing causes for want of jurisdiction or for other reasons not decisive of the merits. And it is settled that a proceeding in mandamus is an independent adversary suit, and a judgment awarding or refusing the writ is a final judgment within the meaning of the statute. Davies v. Corbin, \n112 \nU.S. 36, 40\n, 28 S. L. ed. 627, 629, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 4; McPherson v. Blacker, \n146 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 36 S. L. ed. 869, 873, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 3; American Exp. Co. v. Michigan (American Exp. Co. v. Maynard) \n177 \nU.S. 404, 406\n, 44 S. L. ed. 823, 824, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 695.\n Under the local statutes, as interpreted by the supreme court of the state, whether the logging spur was merely a private convenience or was so used and operated by the railway company that the latter was not free to discontinue service thereon, in the circumstances existing when the rails were removed, was primarily a question for the Commission and secondarily for the Wayne circuit court, wherein the Commission's order was sought to be vacated. By the order the Commission resolved this question against the railway company. The order was valid upon its face and recited that it was made after a hearing and due consideration of the proofs and briefs of the parties. Whether the hearing was adequate and whether the facts relating to the logging spur were such as to sustain the order were matters which were in issue in the suit in the Wayne circuit court, where the railway company was at liberty to produce any evidence legitimately bearing upon the propriety of the order. It was in this situation that the supreme court, having regard to the statutory requirement that the order be given effect and treated as prima facie lawful and reasonable until adjudged otherwise in \n\n[240 U.S. 564, 572]\n\u00a0\n the suit brought to vacate it, and also having regard to the comparative consequences of enforcing or refusing to enforce it while that suit was undetermined, held that it ought to be enforced by mandamus, if a suitable bond was given to indemnify the railway company should the order ultimately be vacated. In this we perceive no deprivation of due process. The granting of an order or writ to maintain or restore the status quo pending the outcome of existing litigation, which really is what was done here, has been practised by the courts of the country since before the Constitution was adopted; and the claim that relief of this nature cannot be granted, even upon condition that ample security be given to make good any loss that may be sustained thereby, without encroaching upon the due process of law secured by the Constitution, is manifestly without merit.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds is of opinion that the judgment is not final within the meaning of  237, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1214], and therefore that the writ of error should be dismissed. \n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDETROIT UNITED RY. v.

Donnelly, William L. Carpenter, Fred A. Baker, and Henry L. Lyster for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. P. J. M. Hally and Harry J. Dingeman for defendants in error.\n\n\n[242 U.S. 238, 242]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n These two cases involve identical questions, were argued together, and may be disposed of in a single opinion. They concern the rates of fare that may be charged by plaintiff in error upon certain street railway lines within the present limits of the city of Detroit, and in both cases it is insisted that the state court of last resort has given such an effect to statutes enacted in the years 1905 and 1907 for extending the corporate limits as to impair the obligation of the contracts contained in franchises theretofore granted by the governing authorities of the annexed territory to the predecessors in title of plaintiff in error.\n Plaintiff in error was incorporated December 28, 1900, under the Street Railway Act of 1867 and amendments thereto (1 Mich. Laws 1867, p. 46; Comp. Laws 1897 chap. 168), for the purpose, as its corporate name indicates, of acquiring, maintaining, and operating various lines theretofore constructed by other companies. Section 15 of the Act (Comp. Laws,  6448) provides that any street railway company may purchase and acquire any street railway in any city, village, or township owned by another corporation, together with the rights, privileges, and franchises thereof, 'and may use and enjoy the rights, privileges, and franchises of such company, the same, and upon the same terms as the company whose road and franchises were so acquired might have done.' Under this authority it shortly thereafter acquired and united under one organization certain lines previously constructed and operated independently throughout the city and its suburbs under different and distinct franchises, of which the following is a summary:\n In November, 1862, the city, by ordinance, granted to the incorporators of the Detroit City Railway the right \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 243]\n\u00a0\n to construct railways in certain streets, including Jefferson avenue, which extends from the center of the city in a northeasterly direction to and beyond the city limits. All the lines authorized were to commence at Campus Martius, and run thence on their several courses to the city limits, and the route along Jefferson avenue to the eastern limits was to be completed within six months after March 31, 1863. In 1873 a section was added authorizing the construction of a second track along Jefferson avenue. In 1862 the city limits on Jefferson avenue were at Mt. Elliott avenue. In 1885 they were extended to a point 200 feet east of Baldwin avenue, and while they remained as thus fixed, and in the year 1889, a supplemental ordinance was passed granting to the Detroit City Railway, among other things, the right to extend its double track along Jefferson avenue from its then present easterly terminus to the easterly city limits, and fixing a time within which the same should be constructed. There was a provision that the additional lines should be operated in connection with and as parts of the then present system of the Detroit City Railway, and that the company should agree, among other things, to make arrangements for carrying passengers between the hours of 5:30 and 7:00 A. M., and between 5:15 and 6:15 P. M., over any of its lines in the city for a single fare upon tickets sold at the rate of eight for 25 cents, with specified transfer rights.\n In 1891 the city limits were further extended along Jefferson avenue to Hurlburt avenue, which was the easterly line of the township of Hamtramck. The railroad on Jefferson avenue in the territory covered by this extension was constructed under franchises granted by the authorities of that township, respecting which no question is now raised.\n From Hurlburt avenue eastwardly to the Country Club in the township of Grosse Point-a distance of about 4 1\/2 miles-the railroad on Jefferson avenue was constructed under several grants made by the town- \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 244]\n\u00a0\n ship and village of Grosse Point and the village of Fairview, in the years 1891, 1893, and 1895, and further powers were conferred upon plaintiff in error, after its acquisition of these lines, by ordinance of the village of Fairview, passed May 16, 1905. These several village and township grants were for terms that have not yet expired, and contain provisions for 5-cent fares within the territory covered by them.\n The Jefferson avenue lines are operated together as a single system in connection with lines leading from the city northwestwardly on Grand River avenue to and beyond the city limits, constructed under rights derived by predecessors in title of plaintiff in error, as follows:\n By ordinance of May 1, 1868, the city granted to the incorporators of the Grnad River Street Railway Company the right to construct lines on certain streets, including Grand River avenue to its intersection with the Michigan Central Railway at or near the then present city limits, with the right to build a second track within five years after the completion of the first. By  8 this line was to be completed to a spectified point contemporaneously with the paving of the street, and thence to the western city limits whenever public necessity, as determined by the common council, should require. By Acts of 1875 and 1885 the limits were extended from the railroad intersection to a point just beyond the Boulevard. By ordinance of August 3, 1888, there was granted the right to construct single tracks on Grand River avenue from its then present terminus to the westerly city limits, and by ordinance of January 3, 1889, the city granted the right, among others, to construct a double track railway on Grand River avenue from Woodward avenue to the city limits, and under this authority tracks were built to the limits just beyond the Boulevard. The latter ordinance required the company to stipulate that it would sell tickets, eight for 25 cents, good over the entire \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 245]\n\u00a0\n route of the company, when offered during the morning and afternoon hours specified in the ordinance passed on the same date respecting the Detroit City lines and already referred to.\n In 1897 the township of Greenfield granted to the incorporators of the Grand River Electric Railway (a different corporation from that last mentioned) a franchise for tracks along the Grand River road from the westerly line of the township to the then present city limits of Detroit, with a right to charge not exceeding 5 cents as the fare for any distance in Greenfield, or six tickets for 25 cents, with school tickets at ten for 30 cents. Under this franchise a railroad was built along the Grand River road from the then city limits near the Boulevard throughout the township of Greenfield.\n As already indicated, all of these lines of railway, with the appurtenant rights, privileges, and franchises, were acquired by plaintiff in error shortly after its incorporation, under the authority of  15 of the Act of 1867\n\n\n Afterwards, by an act of the legislature approved October 24, 1907 ( Mich. Laws, Ex. Sess. 1907, p. 55), a part of the former village of Fairview, including Jefferson avenue for a distance of about 12,500 feet northeastwardly from Hurlburt avenue, was annexed to the city of Detroit. And by Acts of June 16, 1905, and June 19, 1907 (Mich. Local Acts 1905, p. 1144; Local Acts 1907, p. 940), the city limits were extended northwestwardly along Grand River avenue for a distance of about one-half mile in territory previously part of Greenfield township. Each of these acts provided that the annexed territory should be subject to all the laws of the state applicable to the city, and to all the ordinances and regulations of the city, with exceptions not now material.\n It is the contention of defendants in error that the provisions respecting fares in the two ordinances of January 3, 1889, assented to by the predecessors of plaintiff in error \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 246]\n\u00a0\n in the ownership of the city lines on Jefferson and Grand River avenues, were intended to be applicable throughout the city as it might from time to time be enlarged, and that plaintiff in error is bound by the limitations of those ordinances as to all its lines within the city, not only as its limits existed in 1889, but also including the territory annexed in 1905 and 1907.\n In case No. 1, the supreme court of the state sustained the imposition of a fine for failure to accept workingmen's tickets, so called, within the hours prescribed by the ordinance of 1889 upon the Jefferson avenue line within the territory formerly part of the village of Fairview, but annexed to the city by the Act of October 24, 1907. 162 Mich. 460, 139 Am. St. Rep. 582, 125 N. W. 700, 127 N. W. 748.\n In No. 4, the court sustained a judgment awarding a mandamus requiring plaintiff in error to observe the provisions of the ordinances of 1889 upon the entire Jefferson avenue,-Grand River avenue route, so far as included within the city limits as extended in 1907. 173 Mich. 314, 139 N. W. 56.\n In each case plaintiff in error seasonably and expressly insisted that the several township and village grants above referred to were subsisting and valid contracts at and before the legislature of Michigan passed the acts extending the city limits, and that those acts, if so construed or applied as to affect or modify the contracts, were in conflict with  10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States. And it is upon the overruling of these contentions that the cases are brought here, under  237, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1214].\n Defendants in error challenge our jurisdiction, upon the ground that the judgments of the state court of last resort were based solely upon the meaning that it attributed to the ordinances of January 3, 1889, without reference to any subsequent legislation.\n It is true, as this court has many times decided, that the 'contract clause' of the Constitution is not addressed to \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 247]\n\u00a0\n such impairment of contract obligations, if any, as may arise by mere judicial decisions in the state courts without action by the legislative authority of the state. Cross Lake Shooting & Fishing Club v. Louisiana, \n224 \nU.S. 632, 639\n, 56 S. L. ed. 924, 928, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 577; Rank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 344\n, 59 S. L. ed. 969, 987, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 582.\n But in this case there were state laws passed subsequent to the making of the alleged contracts in question, in the form of the legislation of 1905 and 1907 extending the corporate limits of the city. And it is not correct to say that the decisions of the state court turned upon the mere meaning of the contracts without reference to these subsequent laws. Assuming what in effect is conceded, that the village and township franchises constituted contracts within the protection of the Federal Constitution, the force of the decisions was to abrogate the rights acquired by plaintiff in error through its acquisition of the suburban lines, not merely because of the assent of the owners of the city lines to the ordinances of January 3, 1889, but because of the combined effect of those ordinances and the acts of the legislature of Michigan that thereafter extended the city limits. It is true that no question is or can be here made respecting the authority of the legislature to add new territory to the city; and it is likewise true that the annexation acts contain no reference to existing contracts, nor any specific mention of the subject matter of street railway rights. But, in cases of this character, the jurisdiction of this court does not depend upon the form in which the legislative action is expressed, but rather upon its practical effect and operation as construed and applied by the state court of last resort, and this irrespective of the process of reasoning by which the decision is reached, or the precise extent to which reliance is placed upon the subsequent legislation. McCullough v. Virginia, \n172 \nU.S. 102, 116\n, 117 S., 43 L. ed. 382, 387, 388, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 134; Houston & T. C. R. Co. v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 66, 77\n, 44 S. L. ed. 673, 680, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 545; Terre Haute & I. R. Co. v. Indiana, \n194 \nU.S. 579, 589\n, 48 S. L. ed. 1124, 1129, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 767; Louisiana ex rel. Hubert v. New Orleans, 215 \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 248]\n\u00a0\n U.

Louisiana, \n233 \nU.S. 362, 376\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1001, 1006, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 627; Louisiana R. & Nav. Co. v. Behrman, \n235 \nU.S. 164, 170\n, 59 S. L. ed. 175, 180, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 62. The necessary operation of the decisions under review is to give an effect to the annexation acts that substantially impairs the alleged contract rights of plaintiff in error as they theretofore stood; and it makes no difference that that result was reached in part by invoking the provisions of another agreement supposed to be binding upon plaintiff in error. Whether the agreement thus invoked, when properly construed, has the effect attributed to it, is a question that touches upon the merits, and not upon the jurisdiction of this court.\n Coming, then, to the merits: Not only is it not disputed, but it is not open to serious dispute, that the original village and township grants were contractual in their nature. It appears that the recipients of those grants, like their successor, the plaintiff in error, became incorporated under the Street Railway Act of 1867, of which  13 provides that consent for the construction and maintenance of a street railway is to be given by the corporate authorities in an ordinance to be enacted for the purpose, and under such rules, regulations, and conditions as may be prescribed by such ordinance, but that no such railway shall be constructed until the company shall have accepted in writing the terms and conditions upon which they are permitted to use the streets. By  14, after any city, village, or township shall thus have consented to the construction and maintenance of street railways, or granted rights and privileges to the company, and such consent and grant shall have been accepted by the company, the consent shall not be revoked or the company deprived of the rights and privileges conferred. And by  20 the rates of toll or fare to be charged by the company are to be established by agreement between it and the corporate authorities, and are not to be increased without consent of \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 249]\n\u00a0\n such authorities. It is plain, as was pointed out by this court in Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. \n184 \nU.S. 368, 385\n, 46 S. L. ed. 592, 607, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410, that the legislature regarded the fixing of the rate of fare as a subject for agreement between the municipality and the company. And in these cases, as in that, the terms of the several ordinances are such as clearly to import a purpose to contract under the legislative authority thus conferred.\n But it is insisted-and to this effect was the decision of the state court-that the terms of these contracts were in effect modified by the assent of the owners of the city lines on Jefferson and Grand River avenues to the ordinances of January 3, 1889, and the subsequent acquisition of these lines by plaintiff in error, followed by its acquisition of the suburban lines. It is, indeed, argued that the construction placed by the state court upon the ordinances of 1889 as contracts is not subject to the review of this court, and a declaration to this effect is cited from Henderson Bridge Co. v. Henderson City, \n141 \nU.S. 679, 689\n, 35 S. L. ed. 900, 904, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 114, quoted in a subsequent case of the same title in \n173 \nU.S. 592, 602\n, 43 S. L. ed. 823, 826, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 553. But, notwithstanding what was there said, it is too well settled to be open to further debate, that where this court is called upon in the exercise of its jurisdiction to decide whether state legislation impairs the obligation of a contract, we are required to determine upon our independent judgment these questions: (1) Was there a contract? (2) If so, what obligation arose from it? and (3) Has that obligation been impaired by subsequent legislation? Houston & T. C. R. Co. v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 66, 77\n, 44 S. L. ed. 673, 680, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 545; St. Paul Gaslight Co. v. St. Paul, \n181 \nU.S. 142, 147\n, 45 S. L. ed. 788, 791, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 575; Terre Haute & I. R. Co. v. Indiana, \n194 \nU.S. 579, 589\n, 48 S. L. ed. 1124, 1129, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 767.\n But of course in the present cases the crucial question is, What were the obligations of the contracts as they stood at the time of the subsequent legislation? And therefore it becomes material to determine whether, by voluntary action of the parties between the making of the suburban \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 250]\n\u00a0\n GRANTS AND THE PASSAGE OF THE ANNEXATION acts, the obligations arising out of those grants had been modified. The state court deemed that the assent of the Detroit City Railway to that provision of the first-mentioned ordinance of January 3, 1889, which required it to carry passengers at reduced rates 'over any of its lines in said city' applied to any and all lines it either then owned or might thereafter acquire, and comprehended all territory within the limits of the city, including any extension of the municipal boundaries or of the company's lines within those boundaries; and that by the acquisition of the lines of the Detroit City Railway plaintiff in error became bound by this agreement, and was obliged to observe it, even with respect to the lines that it afterwards acquired as assignee of the Grosse Point and Fairview franchises, so far as those lines were included in the extended city limits. It was said (162 Mich. 462, 139 Am. St. Rep. 582, 125 N. W. 700, 127 N. W. 748) that there were two methods of extending street railways: one by construction, the other by purchase under  6448 (2 Comp. Laws 1897), being  15 of the Act of 1867; that 'the purchased railway becomes as much a part of the system as does the railroad as constructed;' and that the ordinance of 1889 was made in view of the power of the legislature to increase or diminish the territory within the city, and the real intent was to provide for single fares within the city limits as they should from time to time be fixed. In 173 Mich. 314, 139 N. W. 56, similar reasoning was applied to the ordinance of 1889 respecting the Grand River Avenue line and the obligation imposed upon the owner of that line to apply the single fare and the reduced rates 'over the entire route of said company.' The court considered (173 Mich. 325, 326) that certain of the language used in the original ordinance of 1862 to the Detroit City Railway and in that of 1868 to the Grand River Street Railway Company showed that the probable growth of the city and development of its public utilities were anticipated, and \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 251]\n\u00a0\n indicated a purpose that the grants should apply as far as the city might be extended.\n Notwithstanding our disposition to lean towards concurrence with the view of the state court of last resort in a matter of this nature, we are unable to accept its construction of the ordinances of 1889. In the first place, we are unable to view the original ordinances as intended to extend the rights of the respective grantees beyond the then existing city limits and as far as the limits should be extended in the future. Their language does not seem to us to admit of this interpretation, and the practical construction placed upon them by the parties was to the contrary. As the city limits on Jefferson avenue and on Grand River avenue were extended, the respective companies obtained, and presumably were required to obtain, new grants authorizing an extension of the railways from their then present termini to the new city limits. Both of the ordinances of 1889 contained express grants to this effect with respect to Jefferson avenue and Grand River avenue respectively. Each of the original city grants, and each of the ordinances of 1889, contained particular and comparatively brief limitations of time within which the authorized lines of railway were to be constructed and placed in operation. For these reasons, and because in other respects the grants are quite specific in their terms, and because the city at that time had no authority to extend its corporate limits nor to make a grant of street railway rights beyond them, we are compelled to conclude that the ordinances of 1889 had no such extensive meaning as that attributed to them by the state court.\n Defendants in error invoke the established rule that the terms of a municipal grant or franchise should be construed strictly as against the grantee, and as favorably to the grantor as its terms permit. The state court deemed the rule to be applicable. 162 Mich. 465; 173 Mich. 323. It is at least doubtful, however, whether the \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 252]\n\u00a0\n rule, properly applied to the facts of these cases, does not bear altogether in favor of plaintiff in error. For of course it is not possible to adopt an extensive construction of the obligations imposed upon the city companies by the ordinances without adopting a like construction as to the extent of the franchises thereby conferred upon the companies. And can it be supposed that if either of these companies had claimed the right to lay down tracks and operate railways in the annexed territory by virtue of the ordinances of 1889, they would not have been met with the rule that municipal grants are to be construed strictly against the grantee, and cannot be extended beyond their express terms? In any view, the ordinances, just because they were intended to be contracts, and not merely legislative enactments, ought to be regarded as having reference to a specific subject matter.\n But were we in error about the construction of these ordinances, we still think that the acquisition of the city lines by plaintiff in error, and its subsequent acquisition of the suburban lines, did not bind it to put the reduced fare provisions in effect upon the suburban lines if and when the city limits should thereafter be extended to include any parts of the latter. If the city lines had been extended into the annexed territory by either of the city railway companies under any authority conferred by or assumed under the ordinances of 1889, a very different question would be presented. But such is not the case. And although we may follow the state court to the extent of considering the acquisition of the suburban lines under  6448, Comp. Laws, as being in effect an extension of the city railways, we cannot, without doing violence to the provisions of that section, regard such acquisition as abrogating any part of the franchise rights that pertained to the suburban lines; for the section itself declares that upon such purchase being made, the purchasing company 'may use and enjoy the rights, privileges, and franchises \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 253]\n\u00a0\n of such company, the same and upon the same terms as the company whose road and franchises were so acquired might have done.' The rate of fare being among the most material and important of the terms and conditions referred to (Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co. \n184 \nU.S. 368, 384\n, 46 S. L. ed. 592, 606, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410; Minneapolis v. Minneapolis Street R. Co. \n215 \nU.S. 417, 434\n, 54 S. L. ed. 259, 270, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 118 ), we find it impossible to regard the purchase of the suburban lines, with their rights, privileges, and franchises, as being in effect an extension of the city lines, but at the same time an abrogation of an essential part of the rights and privileges appurtenant to the acquired lines.\n The state court cited and relied upon Indiana R. Co. v. Hoffman, 161 Ind. 593, 69 N. E. 399, 15 Am. Neg. Rep. 527, and Peterson v. Takoma R. & P. Co. 60 Wash. 406, 140 Am. St. Rep. 936, 111 Pac. 338. In their particular facts and circumstances those cases differ somewhat from the cases now before us; and, without stopping here to analyze them, we deem it sufficient to say that we are unable to accept their reasoning so far as it is inconsistent with the views we have expressed.\n It results that the provisions of the township and village ordinances respecting the rates of fare remained in full force and effect after the acquisition of the suburban lines by plaintiff in error, notwithstanding its previous acquisition of the city lines or the previous assent of the city railway companies to the ordinances of 1889. Because of the provision of  10 of art. 1 of the Constitution of the United States, it was not within the power of the state of Michigan by any subsequent legislation to impair the obligations of those contracts, and since the judgments of the supreme court of that state gave such an effect to the annexation acts of 1905 and 1907, in conjunction with the ordinances of 1889, as to impair those obligations, the judgments must be reversed.\n We have made no particular mention of an agreement entered into between the city and plaintiff in error in the \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 254]\n\u00a0\n year 1909, because we agree with the state court (173 Mich. 321, 139 N. W. 56) that it was not more than a temporary provision for a modus operandi, and had not the effect of waiving any of the rights of either party.\n Judgments reversed, and the causes remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice Clarke, dissenting:\n I greatly regret that I cannot concur in the decision just announced. The opinion of the majority of the court plainly regards the act of the legislature of the state of Michigan, extending the corporate limits of the city of Detroit, as a valid law, passed in the exercise of an undoubted power in the legislature to deal as it does with the municipal corporations of that state, and its validity for the purposes for which it was intended is not questioned. It will remain a valid law after this decision as it was before. In substance the decision of this court is that the supreme court of Michigan, in deciding that there is an implied condition in the contract between the city of Detroit and the railway company that the rates of fare therein provided for shall apply within the city limits when extended, and in requiring the railway company to accept the same fares throughout the new city limits as were accepted throughout the former limits, gives an effect to the extension act which impairs the railway company's contract with the city. I am of the opinion that for the state supreme court thus to interpret the terms of the contract of the railway company with the city is not to give an effect to the valid extension act of the legislature which violates the provision of the Constitution prohibiting a state from passing 'any law impairing the obligation of contracts.' The passing of the valid extension act merely created a situation under which the implied condition, existing in the fare contract from* \n\n[242 U.S. 238, 255]\n\u00a0\n beginning, finds an application to the new territory. This is giving effect not to the terms of the act of the legislature, but to the terms of the contract with the city, and the most that can be said against the decision of the supreme court of Michigan is that it gives an erroneous construction to the contract. But since it is settled by many decisions of this court that the contract clause of the Federal Constitution does not protect contracts against impairment by the decisions of courts except where such decisions give effect to constitutions adopted or laws passed subsequent to the date of such contracts (Cross Lake Shooting & Fishing Club v. Louisiana, \n224 U.S. 632\n, 56 L. ed. 924, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 577), I am of opinion that there is no Federal question before this court in this case and that the writ of error should be dismissed. This is a high and delicate power which the court is exercising in this case, and it should be resorted to only in cases which are clear; and, for the reasons thus briefly stated, I am convinced that this is not such a case.\n I am authorized to state that Mr. Justice Brandeis concurs in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDODGE v.

Baker for appellants.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 122, 124]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Davis and Assistant Attorney General Wallace for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellants are the same persons who sued in Dodge v. Osborn, just decided [\n240 U.S. 118\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 275]. After the dismissal of that suit by the supreme court of the District of Columbia for want of jurisdiction, the parties, on June 10, 1914, filed their bill in the court below against the collector \n\n[240 U.S. 122, 125]\n\u00a0\n of internal revenue, to enjoin the collection of the surtaxes assessed against them, which were disputed in the previous case on substantially the same grounds alleged in the complaint in that case. The bill alleged, however, that plaintiffs had filed with the collector 'an appeal or claim for the remission and abatement of the surtaxes' because of the unconstitutionality of the statute imposing them, and that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to whom the claim had been forwarded by the collector had such protest under advisement. Upon the filing of the bill the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction which was denied July 29, 1914. On the same day, by leave of court, a supplemental bill was filed which alleged that since the filing of the original bill the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had ruled adversely upon plaintiffs' protest, and that thereupon they had paid the surtaxes to the collector under protest, and they prayed a recovery of the amount paid to the collector and for the other relief asked in the original bill. The defendant moved to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction because the suit was brought to enjoin the collection of a tax, contrary to the provisions of  3224, Revised Statutes (Comp. Stat. 1913,  5947), and for want of equity because the income tax law was constitutional and valid. The court sustained the motion on the latter ground and dismissed the bill on the merits, and the case is here on direct appeal because of the constitutional questions.\n The government insists that the court below was without jurisdiction to decide the merits, and we come first to that question. It is apparent if the original bill alone is taken into view that the suit was brought to enjoin the collection of a tax, and the court was without jurisdiction for the reasons stated in the previous case. And it is argued by the government that there was no jurisdiction under the supplemental bill, since it fails to allege that an appeal was taken to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue after the payment of the taxes, and that he refused \n\n[240 U.S. 122, 126]\n\u00a0\n to refund them, and therefore fails to allege a compliance with the conditions imposed by  3220 and 3226 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. Stat. 1913,  5944, 5949), as prerequisites to a suit to recover taxes wrongfully collected. But, broadly considering the whole situation, and taking into view the peculiar facts of the case, the protest to the Commissioner, and his exertion of authority over it, and his adverse ruling upon the merits of the tax, thereby passing upon every question which he would be called upon to decide on an appeal for a refunding of the taxes paid, we think that this case is so exceptional in character as not to justify us in holding that reversible error was committed by the court below in passing upon the case upon its merits, thus putting an end to further absolutely useless and unnecessary controversy. We say useless and unnecessary because on the merits all the contentions urged by the appellants concerning the unconstitutionality of the law and of the surtaxes which it imposes have been considered and adversely disposed of in Brushaber v. Union P. R. Co. \n240 U.S. 1\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 236.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDODGE v.

Baker for appellants.\n Solicitor General Davis and Assistant Attorney General Wallace for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellants filed their bill in the supreme court of the District of Columbia against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to enjoin the assessment and collection of the taxes imposed by the income tax section of the tariff act of October 3, 1913 (38 Stat. at L. 166, 181, chap. 16), and especially the surtaxes therein provided for, on the ground that the statute was void for repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States. The case is here on appeal from the judgment of the court below, affirming the action of the trial court in sustaining a motion to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction because the complainants had an adequate remedy at law, and because of the provision of  3224, Revised Statutes (Comp. Stat. 1913,  5947), that 'no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.'\n We at once put out of view a contention that  3224 is not applicable to taxes imposed by the income tax law since we are clearly of the opinion that \n\n[240 U.S. 118, 120]\n\u00a0\n it is within the contemplation of paragraph L of the act which provides:\n'That all administrative, special, and general provisions of law, including the laws in relation to the assessment, remission, collection, and refund of internal-revenue taxes not heretofore specifically repealed and not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, are hereby extended and made applicable to all the provisions of this section and to the tax herein imposed.' And for the same reason we do not further notice a contention as to the inapplicability of  3220, 3226, and 3227 (Comp. Stat. 1913,  5944, 5949, 5950), to which effect was given by the court below, requiring an appeal to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue after payment of a tax claimed to have been erroneously or illegally assessed and collected, and, upon his refusal to return the sum paid, giving a right to sue for its recovery.\n\n The question for decision, therefore, is whether the sections of the Revised Statutes referred to are controlling as to the case in hand. The plain purpose and scope of the sections are thus stated in Snyder v. Marks, \n109 \nU.S. 189, 193\n, 194 S., 27 L. ed. 901, 903, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 157, a suit brought to enjoin the collection of a revenue tax on tobacco:\n'The inhibition of  3224 (Comp. Stat. 1913,  5947), applice to all assessments of taxes, made under color of their offices, by internal revenue officers charged with general jurisdiction of the subject of assessing taxes against tobacco manufacturers. The remedy of a suit to recover back the tax after it is paid is provided by statute, and a suit to restrain its collection is forbidden. The remedy so given is exclusive, and no other remedy can be substituted for it . . . Cheatham v. United States (Cheatham v. Norvekl) \n92 \nU.S. 85, 88\n, 23 S. L. ed. 561, 562, and again in State R. Tax Cases, \n92 \nU.S. 575, 613\n, 23 S. L. ed. 663, 673, it was said by this court, that the system prescribed by the United States in regard to both customs duties and internal revenue taxes, of stringent measures, \n\n[240 U.S. 118, 121]\n\u00a0\n not judicial, to collect them, with appeals to specified tribunals, and suits to recover back moneys illegally exacted, was a system of corrective justice intended to be complete, and enacted under the right belonging to the government to prescribe the conditions on which it would subject itself to the judgment of the courts in the collection of its revenues. In the exercise of that right, it declares, by  3224, that its officers shall not be enjoined from collecting a tax claimed to have been unjustly assessed, when those officers, in the course of general jurisdiction over the subject-matter in question, have made the assignment [assessment] and claim that it is valid.'\n\n And this doctrine has been repeatedly applied until it is no longer open to question that a suit may not be brought to enjoin the assessment or collection of a tax because of the alleged unconstitutionality of the statute imposing it. Shelton v. Rlatt, \n139 U.S. 591\n, 35 L. ed. 273, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646; Pittsburgh, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Board of Public Works, \n172 U.S. 32\n, 43 L. ed. 354, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90; Pacific Steam Whaling Co. v. United States, \n187 \nU.S. 447, 451\n, 452 S., 47 L. ed. 253, 255, 256, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154.\n But it is contended that this doctrine has no application to a case where, wholly independent of any claim of the unconstitutionality of the tax sought to be enjoined, additional equities sufficient to sustain jurisdiction are alleged, and this, it is asserted, being such a case, falls within the exception to the general rule. But, conceding for argument's sake only the legal premise upon which the contention rests, we think the conclusion that this case falls within such exception is wholly without merit, since, after an examination of the complaint, we are of the opinion that no ground for equitable jurisdiction is alleged. It is true the complaint contains averments that unless the taxes are enjoined many suits by other persons will be brought for the recovery of the taxes paid by them, and also that by reason of  3187, Rev. Stat. (Comp. Stat. 1913,  5909), making the tax a lien on plaintiffs' property, the assessment of the taxes would constitute a cloud on plaintiffs' \n\n[240 U.S. 118, 122]\n\u00a0\n title. But these allegations are wholly inadequate under the hypothesis which we have assumed solely for the sake of the argument, to sustain jurisdiction, since it is apparent on their face they allege no ground for equitable relief independent of the mere complaint that the tax is illegal and unconstitutional and should not be enforced,-allegations which, if recognized as a basis for equitable jurisdiction, would take every case where a tax was assailed because of its unconstitutionality out of the provisions of the statute, and thus render it nugatory, while it is obvious that the statute plainly forbids the enjoining of a tax unless by some extraordinary and entirely exceptional circumstance its provisions are not applicable.\n There is a contention that the provisions requiring an appeal to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue after payment of the taxes, and giving a right to sue in case of his refusal to refund, are wanting in due process, and therefore there is jurisdiction. But we think it suffices to state that contention to demonstrate its entire want of merit.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDONALD v.

Rush Taggart and Francis Raymond Stark for appellee in No. 254.\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n These appeals bring up for consideration the validity of a Wisconsin statute providing for revocation of licenses granted to corporations not organized under the laws of that state. They were heard together, and to dispose of them by one opinion will be convenient.\n Terms and conditions upon which foreign corporations might do local business, and penalties for failure to comply therewith, were first prescribed by the legislature of Wisconsin in 1898. Amendatory and supplemental statutes were enacted, and finally the act of June 20, 1905, added four new sections to the statutes of 1898, one of which follows:\n Sec. 1770f. 'Whenever any foreign corporation doing business in this state shall remove or make application to remove into any district or circuit court of the United States any action or proceeding commenced against it by any citizen of this state, upon any claim or cause of action arising within this state, it shall be the duty of the secretary of state, upon such fact being made to appear to him, to revoke the license of such corporation to do business within this state.'\n Since 1860 the Western Union Telegraph Company, a \n\n[241 U.S. 329, 332]\n\u00a0\n New York corporation, has been continuously carrying on within Wisconsin both intra and interstate commerce, and for use therein has acquired and owns a large amount of property. In 1907 it filed with the secretary of state a copy of its charter, paid the prescribed fee, and took out a license to do intrastate business.\n The Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, since prior to 1898, within Wisconsin has been continuously shipping and selling coal both in intrastate and interstate commerce, and for use therein has purchased at great expense docks and other properties. Having paid required fees and filed its charter with the secretary of state, it received a license, November 10, 1898\n\n\n The Western Union Telegraph Company removed to the United States district court a civil suit begun against it in the circuit court, Dane county, Wisconsin, during 1911; and in 1912 an action against the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company was likewise removed. Averring that so far as the same directs or attempts to direct annulment of its right to do business,  1770f, above quoted, is in conflict with the Federal Constitution, each of the appellees filed an original bill praying an injunction restraining the secretary of state from revoking its license because of such removal. The lower court sustained the claim of unconstitutionality (216 Fed. 199), granted preliminary injunctions, and these direct appeals were taken.\n Consideration of the Wisconsin statutes convinces us that they seek to prevent appellees and other foreign commercial corporations doing local business from exercising their constitutional right to remove suits into Federal courts. To accomplish this is beyond the state's power. The action of the court below in holding  1770f inoperative, and enjoining its enforcement as to appellees, was correct and its decree must be affirmed. \n\n[241 U.S. 329, 333]\n\u00a0\n We are asked in effect to reconsider the question discussed and definitely determined in Harrison v.

About June 13, 1913, this passed out of their control 'for and in behalf of another customer.'\n Prior to November 1, 1913, they were directed to purchase for one Landau 100 shares of 'Copper,' and their books charge them as carrying this number for his account.\n At the close of business November 7, 1913, they were responsible to customers for 280 shares of 'Copper'-Bamberger 30, Duel 100, Wiener, Levy , & Company 50, Landau 100; and they held in actual possession-'in the box'-only two certificates for 50 shares each. November 10, 1913, they used these in making delivery on a short sale. On the same day that sale was 'covered,' and on the 11th they received and placed in their box a certificate (No. 29,373) for 100 shares.\n When bankruptcy occurred (November 13th) their entire liability to 'long' customers on account of 'Copper' arose from purchases of 280 shares as above narrated; and they actually held only certificate No. 29,373, received two days before. To secure their own loans they had on pledge with Kings County Trust Company and National Bank of Commerce, respectively, certificates for 50 and 30 shares; and they also had an outstanding short sale of 100 shares.\n In the deposition of Allaire, bankrupts' cashier, it is said:\n'The said certificate No. 29,373 was never marked or otherwise identified by Hollins & Company as the property of any particular person or customer, or placed in any envelop bearing any indication that the said stock was held for the special account of any particular customer or \n\n[241 U.S. 523, 526]\n\u00a0\n person, and no memorandum appears upon the books or records of Hollins & Company to the effect that said stock was purchased or held for the special or particular account of any one customer or person.\n\n ... * *\n'It was the practice of Hollins & Company to use certificates of stock on hand in making deliveries thereof, indiscriminately and without regard to particular certificates or certificate numbers, excepting only cases where customers deposited certificates of stock standing in their own names as margin for their own accounts, where such certificates were usually retained in kind, but at no time from the 1st day of November, 1913, until and including the 13th day of November, 1913, were there any certificates for Amalgamated Copper stock standing in the name of any customers.\n\n'Certificate No. 29,373, representing 100 shares of Amalgamated Copper stock, was not purchased or received for the account of any member of the firm of Hollins & Company, or for the personal account of said firm as a whole, but was received from the Stock Exchange Clearing House in the usual course of business as representing the balance of Amalgamated Copper stock due said firm on balance on said date.'\n\n The record indicates that all transactions in question were made in pursuance of the usual contracts for speculative purchases and sales of stock upon margins.\n By timely petitions appellants claimed that, in adjusting their accounts for final settlement with bankrupts' estate, they were entitled to have allotted to them respectively 100\/280 and 50\/280 of the 100 shares of 'Copper' represented by certificate No. 29,373. The district court, southern district of New York (212 Fed. 317), sustained their position and ordered accordingly, but the circuit court of appeals reached a different conclusion and reversed the order. 135 C.

Littlefield, \n229 U.S. 19\n, 57 L. ed. 1047, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690; but we think a logical application of principles there approved requires disagreement with the circuit court of appeals and approval of order in the district court.\n In view of our former opinions it must be taken as settled: That bankrupts and their customer stood in the relation of pledgee and pledgeor. That in their dealings stock certificates issued by same corporation lacked individuality, and, like facsimile storage receipts for gold coin, could properly be treated as indistinguishable tokens of identical values. That, as between themselves, after paying amount due brokers, the customer had a right to demand delivery of stocks purchased for his account; and such delivery might have been made during insolvency without creating a preference. Richardson v. Shaw, \n209 U.S. 365\n, 52 L. ed. 835, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 512, 14 Ann. Cas. 981; Thomas v. Taggart, \n209 U.S. 385\n, 52 L. ed. 845, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 519; Sexton v. Kessler & Co. \n225 U.S. 90\n, 56 L. ed. 995, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 657; Gorman v. Littlefield, supra.\n Summing up the doctrine of Richardson v. Shaw concerning legal relationship between customer and broker in buying and holding shares, we said in Gorman v. Littlefield (pp. 23, 24): 'It was held that the certificates of stock were not the property itself, but merely the evidence of it, and that a certificate for the same number of shares represented precisely the same kind and value of property as another certificate for a like number of shares in the same corporation; that the return of a different certificate or the substitution of one certificate for another made no material change in the property right of the customer; that such shares were unlike distinct articles of personal property, differing in kind or value, as a horse, wagon, or harness, and that stock has no earmark which distinguishes one share from another, but is like grain of a uniform quality in an elevator, one bushel being of the same kind and value as another. It was therefore \n\n[241 U.S. 523, 528]\n\u00a0\n concluded that the turning over of the certificates for the shares of stock belonging to the customer, and held by the broker for him, did not amount to a preferential transfer of the bankrupt's property.'\n And we there further declared (pp. 24, 25): 'It is therefore unnecessary for a customer, where shares of stock of the same kind are in the hands of a broker, being held to satisfy his claims, to be able to put his finger upon the identical certificates of stock purchased for him. It is enough that the broker has shares of a certain kind which are legally subject to the demand of the customer. And in this respect the trustee in bankruptcy is in the same position as the broker. Richardson v. Shaw, supra. It is said, however, that the shares in this particular case are not so identified as to come within the rule. But it does appear that at the time of bankruptcy certificates were found in the bankrupt's possession in an amount greater than those which should have been on hand for this customer, and the significant fact is shown that no other customer claimed any right in those shares of stock. It was, as we have seen, the duty of the broker, if he sold the shares specifically purchased for the appellant, to buy others of like kind, and to keep on hand, subject to the order of the customer, certificates sufficient for the legitimate demands upon him. If he did this, the identification of particular certificates is unimportant. Furthermore, it was the right and duty of the broker, if he sold the certificates, to use his own funds to keep the amount good, and this he could do without depleting his estate to the detriment of other creditors who had no property rights in the certificates held for particular customers. No creditor could justly demand that the estate be augmented by a wrongful conversion of the property of another in this manner, or the application to the general estate of property which never rightfully belonged to the bankrupt.' \n\n[241 U.S. 523, 529]\n\u00a0\n When the bankruptcy which occasioned Gorman v. Littlefield took place, the broker's box contained certificates, not specifically allotted, for 350 shares of the designate stock, and the appellant's claim for 250 was the only one presented by a customer. We held that, under the circumstances, no more definite identification was essential, and approved his contention. If, in the instant cause, a certificate for 280 shares of 'Copper' instead of 100 had been on hand, the four customers for whom that number were purchased might successfully claim them under rule approved in Gorman's Case. And merely because the one actually in the box represented insufficient shares fully to satisfy all is not enough to prevent application of that rule so far as the circumstances will permit. The District Court properly awarded to appellants their pro rata parts of the 100 shares.\n Decree of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, and decree of District Court affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney, with whom concurred Mr. Justice Hughes, dissenting:\n In Gorman v. Littlefield, \n229 U.S. 19\n, 57 L. ed. 1047, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690, the reasoning embodied in the following extract from the opinion ( p. 24) was, as I take it, essential to vindicate the conclusion reached by the court: 'It is said, however, that the shares in this particular case are not so identified as to come within the rule. But it does appear that at the time of bankruptcy certificates were found in the bankrupt's possession in an amount greater than those which should have been on hand for this customer, and the significant fact is shown that no other customer claimed any right in those shares of stock. It was, as we have seen, the duty of the broker, if he sold the shares specifically pur- \n\n[241 U.S. 523, 530]\n\u00a0\n chased for the appellant, to buy others of like kind, and to keep on hand, subject to the order of the customer, certificates sufficient for the legitimate demands upon him. If he did this, the identification of particular certificates is unimportant.'\n In the present case, it does not appear that at the time of the inception of the bankruptcy proceedings certificates were found in the brokers' possession equal in amount to those which should have been on hand; several customers are laying claim to the shares that were on hand; and it affirmatively appears that the brokers, having sold the shares specifically purchased for these customers, had not bought others of like kind, nor kept on hand certificates sufficient for the claims of the customers upon them. Not only was no stock kept on hand to answer the claims aggregating 280 shares, but it affirmatively appears that the 100 shares that were on hand were not acquired with intent to make restitution. The deposition of Allaire, the only man having knowledge upon the subject, was that certificate No. 29,373, representing 100 shares of Amalgamated Copper stock, 'was received from the Stock Exchange Clearing House in the usual course of business as representing the balance of Amalgamated Copper stock due said firm on balance on said date,'-the date being one unconnected with any transaction for account of the appellants or either of them.\n It is one thing to infer an intent to make restitution to a customer when the acts have been done that are necessary to effect restitution; it is an entirely different matter to infer an intent to make restitution when no restitution has in fact been made. The presumption of an intent to restore fractional interests in this case must rest on the merest fiction; and such a fiction ought not to be indulged in cases of this character, where it will inevitably result in creating a series of arbitrary \n\n[241 U.S. 523, 531]\n\u00a0\n preferences, contrary to the equity of the bankruptcy act.\n I think the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals (135 C. C. A. 312, 219 Fed. 544) ought to be affirmed, and am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Hughes concurs in this dissent.i \n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEATON v. BOSTON SAFE DEPOSIT & TRUST CO.(1916)\nNo. 466\nArgued: Decided: March 13, 1916\n\n\n\n Mr. Gilbert E. Kemp for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Raymond H. Oveson, Alexander Kendall, and Matthew Hale for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill for instructions, brought by the Trust Company, the principal defendant in error, to ascertain whether a fund bequeathed to it in trust for Mrs. Luke, \n\n[240 U.S. 427, 428]\n\u00a0\n codefendant in error, passed to her trustee in bankruptcy. The bequest was of $75,000, 'The whole of the net income thereof to be paid my adopted daughter, Fannie Leighton Luke, wife of Otis H. Luke, of said Brookline, during her life quarterly in each and every year together with such portion of the principal of said trust fund as shall maks the amount to be paid her at least three thousand dollars a year during her life, said income to be free from the interference or control of her creditors.' It is established law in Massachusetts that such trusts are valid and effective against creditors (Broadway Nat. Bank v. Adams, 133 Mass. 170, 43 Am. Rep. 504), and subject to what we are about to say, against assignees in insolvency or trustees in bankruptcy (Billings v. Marsh, 153 Mass. 311, 10 L.R.A. 764, 25 Am. St. Rep. 635, 26 N. E. 1000; Munroe v. Dewey, 176 Mass. 184, 79 Am. St. Rep. 304, 57 N. E. 340). The trustee in bankruptcy seeks to avoid the effect of these decisions on the ground that Mrs. Luke's equitable life interest was held by the supreme court of the state to be assignable, and that therefore it passed under  70 a (5) of the bankruptcy act, vesting in the trustee all property that the bankrupt 'could by any means have transferred.' [30 Stat. at L. 566, chap. 541, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9654.] The supreme judicial court, however, held that the above-cited cases governed, and that the property did not pass. 220 Mass. 484, L.R.A. --, --, 108 N. E. 64.\n If it be true without qualification that the banrupt could have assigned her interest and by so doing could have freed from the trust both the fund and any proceeds received by her, the argument would be very strong that the statute intended the fund to pass. There would be an analogy at least with the provision giving the trustee all powers that the bankrupt might have exercised for her own benefit,  70 a (3), and there would be difficulty in admitting that a person could have property over which he could exercise all the powers of ownership except to make it liable for his debts. The conclusion that the \n\n[240 U.S. 427, 429]\n\u00a0\n fund was assignable was based on two cases, and we presume was meant to go no farther than their authority required. The first of these simply held that an executor was not liable on his bond for paying over an annuity to an assignee as it fell due, when the assignor to whom it was bequeathed free from creditors had not attempted to avoid his act. Ames v. Clarke, 106 Mass. 573. The other case does not go beyond a dictum that carries the principle no farther. Huntress v. Allen, 195 Mass. 226, 122 Am. St. Rep. 243, 80 N. E. 949. It is true that where the restriction has been enforced there generally has been a clause against anticipation, but the present decision in following them holds the restricting clause paramount, and therefore we feel warranted in assuming that the power of alienation will not be pressed to a point inconsistent with the dominant intent of the will. Whether, if that power were absolute, the restriction still should be upheld, as in case of a statutory exemption that leaves the bankrupt free to convey his rights, it is unnecessary to decide.\n The law of Massachusetts treats such restrictions as limiting the character of the equitable property and inherent in it. Dunn v. Dobson, 198 Mass. 142, 146, 84 N. E. 327; Lathrop v. Merrill, 207 Mass. 6, 9, 22 N. E. 1019. Whatever may have been the criticisms upon the policy and soundness of the doctrine, and whatever may be the power of this court to weigh the reasoning upon which it has been established by the Massachusetts cases (Page v. Edmunds, \n187 \nU.S. 596, 602\n, 47 S. L. ed. 318, 321, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 200), it has been established too long and is too nearly sanctioned by the decisions of this court to be overthrown here ( Nichols v. Eaton, \n91 U.S. 716\n, 23 L. ed. 254; Shelton v. King, \n229 \nU.S. 90, 99\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1086, 1089, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 686). The policy of the bankruptcy act is to respect state exemptions, and until the Massachusetts decisions shall have gone farther than they yet have we are not prepared to say that the present bequest is not protected by the Massachusetts rule.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEMBREE v. KANSAS CITY & LIBERTY BOULEVARD ROAD DIST.(1916)\nNo. 187\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 242, 243]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harris L. Moore, W. A. Craven, Ernest Simrall, James S. Simrall, and John M. Cleary for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 242, 245]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William M. Williams and Claude Hardwicke for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n The is a suit to restrain the issue and sale of road district bonds and the levy and recordation of special taxes to pay them. A trial of the issues resulted in a judgment for the defendants, which at first was reversed and on a rehearing was affirmed. 257 Mo. 593, 166 S. W. 282. The plaintiffs prosecute this writ of error.\n When the suit was begun the road district had been organized, a road had been selected for improvement, and preliminary steps had been taken for issuing the bonds and levying the special taxes,-all conformably to the local statute. Rev. Stat. (Mo.) 1909, chap. 102, art. 7; Mo. Laws 1911, 373. The district is about 7 miles in length and 3 in width, and is bounded on the greater part of one side by the Missouri river. The road selected for improvement extends through the district in the direction of its length. The cost of the improvement is to be met temporarily by the issue and sale of bonds, and ultimately by the levy and collection of special taxes upon all the lands in the district. The cost is to be apportioned by rating the lands-without the buildings thereon-at their full fair value where lying within 1 mile of the road, at 75 per cent of such value where lying between 1 and 2 miles from road, and at 50 per cent of such value where lying more than 2 miles therefrom (all seem to be within 2 miles here), and then charging each tract with a share of the entire cost corresponding to its proportion of the value of all the lands as so rated. The lands are appraised by the district commissioners and the cost of the improvement is apportioned by the county clerk. \n\n[240 U.S. 242, 246]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiffs own lands within the district and object to the issue of the bonds and to the levy of the special taxes, upon the ground that the scheme for subjecting the lands to the payment of the cost is repugnant to the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in that the landlord is not afforded any opportunity to be heard on the questions whether his lands will be benefited by the improvement, whether, if benefited, the benefits in the different zones will be in accord with the graduated ratings before indicated, and whether the appraisement of his lands for the purposes of the apportionment is fair.\n The district was not established or defined by the legislature, but by an order of the county court, made under a general law. Whether there was need for the district, and, if so, what lands should be included and what excluded, was committed to the judgment and discretion of that court, subject to these qualifications: First, that the district should contain at least 640 acres of contiguous land and be wholly within the county; second, that the court's action should be invoked by a petition signed by the owners of a majority of the acres in the proposed district; and, third, that public notice-conceded to be adequate-should be given, by the clerk of the court, of the presentation of the petition and the date when it would be considered, and that owners of land within the proposed district should be accorded an opportunity to appear, either collectively or separately, and oppose its formation. In this connection the statute says: 'the court shall hear such petition and remonstrance, and shall make such change in the boundaries of such proposed district as the public good may require and make necessary, and if after such changes are made it shall appear to the court that such petition is signed or in writing consented to by the owners of a majority of all the acres of land within the district as so changed, the court shall make a preliminary \n\n[240 U.S. 242, 247]\n\u00a0\n order establishing such public road district, and such order shall set out the boundaries of such district as established . . . but the boundaries of no district shall be so changed as to embrace any land not included in the notice made by the clerk unless the owner thereof shall in writing consent thereto, or shall appear at the hearing, and is notified in open court of such fact and given an opportunity to file or join in a remonstrance.' The order actually made shows that four of the present plaintiffs, with three others, appeared in opposition to the petition, recites that 'the court, after hearing and considering said petition and said protests and remonstrances and all evidence offered in support thereof, finds that the public good requires and makes necessary the organization, formation, and creation of such proposed public road district . . . with boundaries as stated in said petition,' and sets out the boundaries of the district as established.\n The sole purpose in creating the district, as the statute shows, was to accomplish the improvement of public roads therein,-the particular roads to be designated by the district commissioners and an approving vote of the landowners.\n As the district was not established by the legislature, but by an exercise of delegated authority, there was no legislative decision that its location, boundaries, and needs were such that the lands therein would be benefited by its creation and what it was intended to accomplish, and, this being so, it was essential to due process of law that the landowners be accorded an opportunity to be heard upon the question whether their lands would be thus benefited. If the statute provided for such a hearing, the decision of the designated tribunal would be sufficient, unless made fraudulently or in bad faith. Fallbrook Irrig Dist. v. Bradley, \n164 \nU.S. 112, 167\n, 174 S., 175, 42 L. ed. 369, 391, 394, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 56.\n Did the statute contemplate such a hearing? We have \n\n[240 U.S. 242, 248]\n\u00a0\n seen that it required that adequate public notice be given of the presentation of the petition for the creation of the district and the time when it would be considered, made provision for the presentation of remonstrances by owners of lands within the proposed district, and directed that the petition and remonstrances be heard by the county court, that the court make such change in the boundaries 'as the public good may require' and that the boundaries be not enlarged unless the owners of the lands not before included consent in writing or appear at the hearing and be given an opportunity to present objections. That a hearing of some kind was contemplated is obvious, and is conceded. But it is insisted that it was not to be directed to the question whether the lands included would be benefited by the creation of the district and what it was intended to accomplish. If that were so, there would be little purpose in the hearing and no real necessity for it.\n True, the statute does not in terms say that lands which will not be benefited shall be excluded, or that only such as will be benefited shall be included, but it does say that the court shall make such change in the proposed boundaries 'as the public good may require.' In the presence of this comprehensive direction there can be no doubt that the legislature intended to authorize and require the county court to adjust the boundaries so they would include only such lands as might be reasonably expected to be benefited by the improvement of the district roads, and therefore might be properly charged with the cost of that work. That there is an inseparable union between the public good and due regard for private rights should not be forgotten.\n Of course, the nature and extent of the hearing contemplated by the statute is a question of local law, and if it were clear that the supreme court of the state had settled it, we should accept and follow that ruling. Whether \n\n[240 U.S. 242, 249]\n\u00a0\n the question has been settled is at least uncertain. In the principal opinion delivered on the original hearing that court said: 'We hold that the general assembly, in granting to landowners of a proposed road district the privilege of being heard by remonstrance, intended that such landowners should have the right in such remonstrance to urge against the organization of the district or the inclusion of their lands therein any statutory or constitutional grounds which such landowners may possess; and that if such grounds be valid the court may exclude the lands of the remonstrants or refuse to incorporate the proposed district. This ruling is rendered necessary to avoid the conclusion that the general assembly directed a hearing without intending that any relief might thereby be obtained.' That opinion, although copied into the record, does not appear in the Missouri Reports. They contain only the opinion delivered on the rehearing. The former may have been entirely recalled. If so, the question dealt with in the quotation made from it has not been settled, for the later opinion is silent upon the subject. But whether the question be settled or open is not of much importance, for, as before indicated, our view of the statute accords with that expressed by the state court in the excerpt from the first opinion.\n We conclude therefore that the statute did provide for according the landowners an opportunity to be heard, when the district was created, upon the question whether their lands would be benefited, and also that the order establishing the district shows that the statute was complied with in that regard.\n But in opposition to this conclusion it is urged that an adequate hearing could not be had at that time because the road to be improved had not been selected and no one could say what lands would be benefited. We are not impressed with this contention. As was well understood, \n\n[240 U.S. 242, 250]\n\u00a0\n the purpose in creating the district was to bring about the improvement of its roads. Their number, location, and condition were known, as was also the extent and nature of their use. The district was of limited area and the proximity or relation of every part to each road was patent. As applied to such a situation, we perceive no serious obstacle to determining with approximate certainty and satisfaction whether the improvement of any one or more of the roads-even though no particular one was as yet selected-would be of benefit throughout the district. We say with approximate certainty and satisfaction, because this is all that is required. At best the question is one of opinion and degree, even where the improvement to be made has been definitely determined. The boundaries of drainage, irrigation, and other benefit districts are often defined in this way. Indeed, it is conceded that had the legislature created this particular district, the present objection would be untenable. If such a body can obtain the requisite information and exercise the requisite judgment, it is not easy to believe that the task would be more difficult for a county court sitting in the vicinity.\n The claim that the landowners are entitled to a hearing on the question whether the benefits in the different zones will be in accord with the graduated ratings of their lands is not seriously pressed upon our attention and requires but brief notice. The ratings are not fixed in the exercise of delegated authority, but by the statute itself, which must be taken as a legislative decision that in a district lawfully constituted, in the manner before indicated, the benefits to the lands in the different zones will be in approximate accord with the ratings named. This being so, no hearing is essential to give effect to this feature of the apportionment. A legislative act of this nature can be successfully called in question only when it is so devoid of any reasonable basis as to be essentially arbitrary and \n\n[240 U.S. 242, 251]\n\u00a0\n an abuse of power (Wagner v. Leser, \n239 U.S. 207\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66; Houck v. Little River Drainage Dist. \n239 U.S. 254\n, 60 L. ed . --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 58; Myles Salt Co. v. Iberia & St. M. Drainage Dist. \n239 U.S. 478\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 204; Gast Realty & Invest. Co. v. Schneider Granite Co. \n240 U.S. 55\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 254. And see Bi-Metallic Invest. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, \n239 \nU.S. 441, 445\n, 446 S., 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141), which obviously is not the case here.\n The claim that the landowners are not afforded an opportunity to be heard in respect of the value of their lands is also untenable. While no hearing is given when the lands are appraised, one is accorded when the tax is sought to be enforced. The mode of enforcement is by a suit in a court of justice, when, as the supreme court of the state holds, owners aggrieved by the valuation may have a full hearing upon that question. This is due process. Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 \nU.S. 97, 104\n, 24 S. L. ed. 616, 619; Hagar v. Reclamation Dist. \n111 \nU.S. 701, 711\n, 28 S. L. ed. 569, 573, 4 Sup. Ct.

Manchester, C. D. Hine, James B. Kennedy, and John W. Ford for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. William R. Stewart for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n The supreme court of Ohio (89 Ohio St. 81, 105 N. E. 189) affirmed a circuit court judgment which sustained a judgment re- \n\n[242 U.S. 303, 304]\n\u00a0\n covered in a court of common pleas by Welsh against the Erie Railroad Company for damages on account of personal injuries suffered by him while in its employ as a yard conductor in the Brier Hill yard, near Youngstown, Ohio; overruling the contention of the defendant (now plaintiff in error) that by certain rulings of the trial court defendant had been deprived of rights secured to it by the Federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908 (chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 193,  8657).\n Plaintiff's case was that, on March 7, 1911, about 11 o'clock P. M., while in the performance of his duties, he attempted to alight from the footboard of a slowly moving locomotive; that in so doing he stepped upon a pulley wheel of an interlocking mechanism situate between the tracks, and then covered with snow, and the turning of the wheel under his weight caused his foot to become entangled in the interlocking wires, as a result of which he fell partly under the locomotive and sustained serious injuries. The negligence attributed to defendant was the failure properly to guard or cover the wires and the pulley wheel. There was evidence tending to show such a knowledge on plaintiff's part of the nature and character of the interlocking apparatus and its location between the tracks, and such a knowledge and appreciation of the dangers incident thereto, as to bring into play the defense of assumption of risk (Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 503\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1062, 1069, L.R.A. 1915C, 1, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475, 8 N. C. C. A. 834; Jacobs v. Southern R. Co. \n241 \nU.S. 229, 234\n, 30 S. L. ed. 970, 976, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 588), if the case came within the Federal act; and this depended upon whether plaintiff was employed by defendant in interstate commerce at the time he received his injuries. Defendant's fourth request was for the submission to the jury of the question whether plaintiff was employed in such commerce, with an appropriate instruction embodying the rule as to assumption of risk in case they should find him to have been so employed. This request, which in terms invoked the protection of the act of Congress, was refused, and the trial court, in the in- \n\n[242 U.S. 303, 305]\n\u00a0\n structions given, declined to follow that act or the common law, and, on the contrary, instructed the jury that, under a state statute held to be applicable, the assumption of risk was not a defense.\n The rulings of the trial court were sustained by the supreme court ( and presumably by the circuit court) upon the ground that, upon the undisputed evidence, plaintiff was not at the time employed in interstate commerce. As to this question, there was testimony tending to show that defendant was a common carrier by rail engaged in commerce between the states, and that plaintiff was and for some time had been a yard conductor engaged in night duty at its Brier Hill yard, a mile or more west of Youngstown; that he performed miscellaneous services in the way of shifting cars and breaking up and making up trains, under orders of the yardmaster, and had to apply frequently to the latter for such orders; that when any orders thus given had been performed, or had 'run out,' he usually reported at the yardmaster's office for further orders; that on the night in question plaintiff, with a yard crew, took a freight car loaded with merchandise destined to a point without the state, and a caboose which, so far as appears, was not to go beyond the limits of the state, from the Brier Hill yard eastwardly to the 'F. D. yard' in Youngstown, where the freight car was placed upon a siding, so that it might be made up into a train by another crew; that they then took the caboose a short distance farther and placed it upon another siding; that they next took the engine to a water plug and took on water, and then returned with it to the Brier Hill yard; that on this return journey the engine was slowed down near the yardmaster's office, which is at the easterly end of that yard, so as to enable Welsh to report for further orders, all previous orders having been executed; and that the injury was received while he was attempting to alight for that purpose. \n\n[242 U.S. 303, 306]\n\u00a0\n It was in evidence, also, that the orders plaintiff would have received had he not been injured on his way to the yardmaster's office would have required him immediately to make up an interstate train. Upon the strength of this it is argued that his act at the moment of his injury partook of the nature of the work that, but for the accidental interruption, he would have been called upon to perform. In our opinion, this view is untenable. By the terms of the Employers' Liability Act the true test is the nature of the work being done at the time of the injury, and the mere expectation that plaintiff would presently be called upon to perform a task in interstate commerce is not sufficient to bring the case within the act. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Behrens, \n233 \nU.S. 473, 478\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1051, 1055, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 163, 10 N. C. C. A. 153.\n There remains the contention that plaintiff's act in stepping from the yard engine was in completion of his trip to the 'F. D. yard' with the interstate car, and hence was itself an act in furtherance of interstate commerce. This cannot be answered by saying, in the words used arguendo by the state supreme court (89 Ohio St. 88), that 'he was not then and there employed in moving or handling cars engaged in interstate commerce.' The question remains whether he was performing an act so directly and immediately connected with his previous act of placing the interstate car in the 'F. D. yard' as to be a part of it or a necessary incident thereto. New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v. Carr, \n238 \nU.S. 260, 264\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1298, 1300, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 780, 9 N. C. C. A. 1; Shanks v.

And this depends upon whether the series of acts that he had last performed was properly to be regarded as a succession of separate tasks or as a single and indivisible task. It turns upon no interpretation of the act of Congress, but involves simply an appreciation of the testimony and admissible inferences therefrom in order to determine whether there was a question to be submitted to the jury as to the fact of employment \n\n[242 U.S. 303, 307]\n\u00a0\n in interstate commerce. The state courts held there was no such question, and we cannot say that in so concluding they committed manifest error. It results that, in the proper exercise of the jurisdiction of this court in cases of this character, the decision ought not to be disturbed. Great Northern R. Co. v.

WILLS(1916)\nNo. 82\nArgued: Decided: April 10, 1916\n\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 642, 643]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Elisha B. Durfee, John A. Bellatti, Walter Bellatti, and George B. Scofield for appellant.\n Messrs. Elbert C. Ferguson, William Mumford, and John C. Burchard for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a controversy arising in a bankruptcy proceeding. On December 30, 1912, a creditors' petition in bankruptcy was filed in the United States district court for the southern district of Illinois against the Federal Contracting Company, a corporation of that state, and on March 25, 1913, it was adjudicated a bankrupt. Between those dates, and on March 6, the Fairbanks Steam Shovel Company, the present appellant, without actual knowledge of the filing of the petition, seized a certain floating steam dredge, then in possession of the Contracting Company at Beardstown, Cass county, which is in the southern district of Illinois; doing this by virtue of a chattel mortgage given by the Contracting Company to appellant on June 8, 1912, the dredge then being in the possession of the mortgagor at Beardstown. After the adjudication of bankruptcy, but before the appointment of a trustee, the bankrupt filed a petition against appellant in the bankruptcy proceeding, setting up that the mortgage was not acknowledged or recorded in Cook County, Illinois, where the principal office of the bankrupt was located by its charter, and for this reason was invalid against the trustee in bankruptcy to be appointed, and praying that appellant might be restrained from selling \n\n[240 U.S. 642, 644]\n\u00a0\n the dredge, as it threatened to do. The court entered a temporary restraining order, which was served; appellant, without questioning the jurisdiction of the court, appeared and answered, admitting that it had taken possession of the dredge under the provisions of the mortgage, alleging that the mortgage was duly executed and was given to secure a part of the purchase price of the dredge, and that at the time of its execution the bankrupt, through its officers, represented to appellant that its principal place of business was at Beardstown; and further, that, before the adjudication of bankruptcy, appellant took actual possession of the dredge, and thereby perfected its title thereto; and asking that the injunction be dissolved, etc. No trustee having yet been appointed, it was ordered by the court, upon a stipulation between the parties, that the sale should proceed, under an arrangement providing, among other things, that if appellant purchased the dredge, it should hold it subject to the decision of the controversy. The sale was held accordingly, and the dredge was purchased by appellant. Thereafter appellee was appointed trustee in bankruptcy, and was substituted as a party to the controversy in place of the bankrupt. The matter was heard before the referee, who reported in favor of the trustee. The district court overruled exceptions and confirmed the report; and, on appeal, the circuit court of appeals affirmed the decree. 129 C. C. A. 224, 212 Fed. 688. The appeal to this court antedated the act of January 28, 1915, chap. 22,  4 and 6, 38 Stat. at L. 804.\n The principal question is whether the chattel mortgage was properly acknowledged and recorded so as to be valid against the trustee in bankruptcy.\n The law of Illinois respecting chattel mortgages may be found in chap. 95 of Hurd's Rev. Stat. 1909. Par. 1 provides that no such mortgage shall be valid as against the rights and interests of any third person unless possession shall be delivered to and remain with the grantee, \n\n[240 U.S. 642, 645]\n\u00a0\n or the instrument shall provide for the possession of the property to remain with the grantor, and the instrument be acknowledged and recorded as thereinafter directed. Par. 2 provides that such instrument shall be acknowledged before a specified officer of 'the county where the mortgagor resides,' if a resident of the state, with a proviso that in counties having a population of more than 200,000 (this applies to Cook county), such instrument, 'if the mortgagor is a resident of the state,' shall be acknowledged before one of several designated officers of the town, precinct, district, or county 'in which the mortgagor resides.' By par. 4, the mortgage, when so acknowledged, 'shall be admitted to record by the recorder of the county in which the mortgagor shall reside at the time when the instrument is executed and recorded.'\n The bankrupt was incorporated in the year 1905 under a general act ( Hurd's Rev. Stat. 1909, chap. 32), the second paragraph of which requires the organizers to make, subscribe, and acknowledge a statement setting forth the name of the proposed corporation, the object for which it is formed, its capital stock, the location of the principal office, etc., which is to be filed in the office of the secretary of state. If the object of the proposed corporation is clearly and definitely stated and is a lawful object, the secretary of state issues to the corporators a license as commissioners to open books for subscription to the capital stock. After the stock is subscribed, directors or managers elected, etc., the secretary of state ( 4) issues a certificate of the complete organization of the corporation. But, before this is done, the corporation must 'file with the secretary of state a statement setting forth the postoffice address of its business office, giving street and number.' (Act of May 10, 1901, Laws 1901, p. 124; Hurd's Rev. Stat. 1909, chap. 32, par. 192.)\n Other sections (chap. 32, 50 et seq.) contain elaborate \n\n[240 U.S. 642, 646]\n\u00a0\n provisions to be complied with when the directors of any corporation 'may desire to change the name, to change the place of business, to enlarge or change the object for which such corporation was formed, to increase or decrease the capital stock,' etc. There is to be a special meeting of the stockholders, called on notice mailed to each stockholder and published in a newspaper, and votes representing two thirds of all the stock of the corporation shall be necessary for the adoption of the proposed change; an appropriate certificate is to be filed in the office of the secretary of state, and a like certificate made a matter of record in the county where the principal business office of the corporation is located; and a notice of the change is also to be published in a newspaper for three successive weeks.\n The statement made by the organizers of the bankrupt corporation declared: 'The location of the principal office is in the city of Chicago, in the county of Cook, and state of Illinois.' A license was issued to them as commissioners to open books for subscription to the capital stock, and in due course they made their report to the secretary of state, in which it was stated: 'That the postoffice address of the business office of said company is at No.-Park Hotel, streets not numbered, in the city of Beardstown, in the county of Cass, and state of Illinois.' Upon receipt of this, the secretary of state issued a certificate of complete organization, including in it the first statement, the report of the commissioners, and other papers filed in his office respecting the organization of the corporation, as required by the statute. The first meetings of the stockholders were held in Chicago, and another stockholders' meeting was held there about two years later. All other recorded meetings of stockholders and directors were held in Beardstown. An office was nominally maintained in Chicago, but no records or books of account were kept not any business transacted \n\n[240 U.S. 642, 647]\n\u00a0\n there. So far as the practical conduct of the business was concerned, and to all outward appearances, the principal office was in Beardstown. But no change of 'the place of business' was made in the manner prescribed by the statute.\n The chattel mortgage was made, acknowledged, and recorded in Cass county, and was never either recorded or acknowledged in Cook county.\n The circuit court of appeals held, affirming the district court, that the 'residence' of the bankrupt was in Chicago, which is in Cook county, and that therefore the mortgage, having never been properly acknowledged or recorded, was invalid as against the trustee in bankruptcy.\n This, in our opinion, was a correct disposition of the question. The statutes of Illinois recognize the propriety of a fixed location for the principal office of a corporation, requiring this to be specified in the certificate of organization and to be left unchanged except on formal action by two thirds in interest of the stockholders. Whether 'principal office' and 'business office' are synonymous is not entirely clear, and we are referred to no decision by the state courts throwing light upon this. But, supposing them to be synonymous, it does not seem to us that the report of the commissioners for stock subscriptions can have the effect of establishing the office in Cass county, for we find do authority in the commissioners to materially change the location of the principal office as formally declared by the organizers.\n We are of opinion that a corporation organized under the laws of Illinois is to be deemed a resident of the state within the meaning of the chattel mortgage act, and that the county of its residence must be taken to be the county in which its principal office is located. So far as the decisions of the state courts throw light upon the question, they bear out this view. Bank of North America v. Chicago, D. & V. R. Co. 82 Ill. 493, 496; Hewitt v. General \n\n[240 U.S. 642, 648]\n\u00a0\n Electric Co. 164 Ill. 420, 425, 54 N. E. 725. And a similar view prevails in other jurisdictions. In Ex parte Schollenberger, \n96 \nU.S. 369, 377\n, 24 S. L. ed. 853, 854, this court, by Mr. Chief Justice Waite, said: 'A corporation cannot change its residence or its citizenship. It can have its legal home only at the place where it is located by or under the authority of its charter; but it may by its agents transact business anywhere, unless prohibited by its charter or excluded by local laws.' And in Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Gonzales, \n151 \nU.S. 496, 504\n, 38 S. L. ed. 248, 251, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 401, the court, by Mr. Justice Brown, said: 'In the case of a corporation the question of inhabitancy must be determined, not by the residence of any particular officer, but by the principal offices of the corporation, where its books are kept and its corporate business is transacted, even though it may transact its most important business in another plact.' A case in point with the present is First Nat. Bank v. Wilcox, 72 Wash. 473, 130 Pac. 756, 131 Pac. 203. And see Western Transp. Co. v. Scheu, 19 N. Y. 408; Union S. B. Co. v. Buffalo, 82 N. Y. 351, 355; Pelton v. Northern Transp. Co. 37 Ohio St. 450; Jenkins v. California Stage Co. 22 Cal. 537; Cohn v. Central P. R. Co. 71 Cal. 488, 12 Pac. 498.\n It is hardly necessary to say that whatever equities, if any, arose out of the mortgagor's representation that its principal place of business was at Beardstown, or out of the fact that the mortgage was given to secure a part of the purchase price of the dredge, were confined in their effect to the immediate parties, and could not operate to estop the trustee in bankruptcy, representative of the interests of creditors, for whose protection the recording act was passed.\n It is objected by appellant that a determination that the bankrupt corporation had its principal place of business and therefore its residence in Cook county, which is in the northern district, shows at the same time that the United States district court for the southern district of \n\n[240 U.S. 642, 649]\n\u00a0\n Illinois had no jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding in bankruptcy under  2 of the bankruptcy act, and hence no jurisdiction over the present controversy. (See Harris v. First Nat. Bank, \n216 U.S. 382\n, 54 L. ed. 528, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 296.) As to this, the circuit court of appeals correctly held that appellant, by answering and making defense upon the merits, consented to the jurisdiction, so that whether, under  23a and 23b, construed together with  70e, as amended, consent to the jurisdiction of the district court was required, need not be considered.\n On like grounds, it is insisted that the adjudication of bankruptcy was invalid, and that the trustee had no capacity to sue. But the adjudication is not open to collateral attack, and the question of capacity was waived because not raised in the trial court.\n Appellant's title was not perfected, as against the trustee in bankruptcy, by taking possession of the dredge under the mortgage after the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, and before the adjudication. Since the amendment of  47a-2 of the bankruptcy act by the act of June 25, 1910 (chap. 412,  8, 36 Stat. at L. 838, 840, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9586, 9631), trustees have the rights and remedies of a lien creditor or a judgment creditor as against an unrecorded transfer. The estate was in custodia legis from the filing of the petition, and the title of the trustee related back to that date. Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co. \n222 \nU.S. 300, 307\n, 56 S.

Rep. 568.\n Other questions are raised, but they are unsubstantial and require no particular mention.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFARMERS' & MECHANICS' NAT BANK OF PHILADELPHIA v. RIDGE AVENUE(1916)\nNo. 291\nArgued: March 15, 1916Decided: April 3, 1916\n\n\n\n Mr. J. Frank Staley and Lewis, Adler & Laws, for the Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank. \n\n[240 U.S. 498, 499]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank R. Savidge for the Ridge Avenue Bank et al.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 498, 501]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The essential facts stated in the certificate of the court below are these: The firm of William Gray & Sons and its three partners, William J. Gray, Peter Gray, and Alexander J. Gray, were adjudged bankrupts. The same person was appointed trustee of the four estates. It resulted from charging separately against each estate the mere necessary and unquestioned expenses of administration that there was nothing whatever in the estate either of the partnership, of that of William J. Gray or of Peter Gray,-indeed in the latter there was nothing to defray the expenses of administration. As to the estate of Alexander J. Gray, after charging the expenses of administration there remained $1,597.26. Creditors of the firm proved their debts against it, the Ridge Avenue Bank of Philadelphia being among the number, while only one creditor, the Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank of Philadelphia, proved a debt against the individual estate of Alexander J. Gray, that debt exceeding the total sum of the estate. No creditor proved against the individual estate of William J. Gray or that of Peter \n\n[240 U.S. 498, 502]\n\u00a0\n Gray. Under these conditions the dispute which arose was whether the estate of Alexander J. Gray was to go wholly to the Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank, the individual creditor, or was to be proportionately applied to the individual and firm creditors because of the absence of any firm estate for distribution. The district court directed the fund to be distributed between the Farmers' & Mechanics' National Bank, the creditor of the individual estate, and the creditors of the firm, and the question of law which the court below propounds to enable it to review this action of the district court, is as follows:\n'When a partnership as such is insolvent, and when each individual member is also insolvent, and when the only fund for distribution is produced by the individual estate of one member, are the individual creditors of such member entitled to priority in the distribution of the fund?'\n\n The solution of this question primarily depends upon an interpretation of subsection f of  5 of the bankruptcy act of 1898, and secondarily upon a consideration of all the pertinent subsections of the section; indeed, of all the relevant provisions of the context of the act. Subsection f is as follows:\n'f' The net proceeds of the partnership property shall be appropriated to the payment of the partnership debts, and the net proceeds of the individual estate of each partner to the payment of his individual debts. Should any surplus remain of the property of any partner after paying his individual debts, such surplus shall be added to the partnership assets and be applied to the payment of the partnership debts. Should any surplus of the partnership property remain after paying the partnership debts, such surplus shall be added to the assets of the individual partners in the proportion of their respective interests in the partnership.' [30 Stat. at L. 548, chap. 541, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9589.] \n\n[240 U.S. 498, 503]\n\u00a0\n Let us first sift the respective contentions so as to reach the ultimate proposition required to be decided. In the first place, in favor of the right of the creditor of the individual partner to be paid, under the facts stated, out of the individual estate, to the entire exclusion, if necessary, of the creditors of the partnership estate, it is urged that such result is so unambiguously commanded by the rule of distribution established by the text of subsection f that there is no room for construction, but the simple duty arises to enforce the text, as to do otherwise would amount to judicial legislation. It is undoubted that this proposition is supported by largely the greater weight of opinion of the courts of the United States in enforcing subsection f. Re Wilcox, 94 Fed. 84 (1899); Re Mills, 95 Fed. 269 (1899); Re Daniels, 110 Fed. 745 (1901); Re Janes, 67 C. C. A. 216, 133 Fed. 912 (1904), reversing 128 Fed. 527; Re Henderson, 142 Fed. 588 (1906); Euclid Nat. Bank v. Union Trust & D. Co. 79 C. C. A. 485, 149 Fed. 975 (1906), affirming Re Henderson, supra; Mills v. Fisher, 16 L.R.A.(N.S.) 656, 87 C. C. A. 77, 159 Fed. 897 (1908); Re Hull, 224 Fed. 796 (1915).\n\n On the other hand, to refute the proposition and to avoid the effect of the authorities sustaining it just referred to three contentions are relied upon. (a) It is said the absence of ambiguity in the general rule as stated in subsection f is conceded and the soundness of the authorities cited recognizing that fact is not disputed, but these concessions, it is declared, are negligible, since the fact that there were no partnership assets and no solvent partner causes this case to be an exception to the rule expressed in subsection f, hence not governed by it, and therefore makes it clear that the authorities cited are inapposite because they mistakenly applied the general rule to an exceptional case which that rule did not govern. (b) That this is demonstrated first by the fact that the general rule \n\n[240 U.S. 498, 504]\n\u00a0\n was as unambiguously expressed in the previous bankruptcy acts ( 14 of the act of 1841 [5 Stat. at L. 448, chap. 9] and  36 of the act of 1867 [ 14 Stat. at L. 534, chap. 176]), and yet, under those acts, the exception stated, which unquestionably governed in bankruptcy in England, where the general rule was the same, was also held to be controlling by judicial decisions in this country. This being true, the argument insists the inference is that Congress, in adopting the act 1898 without any expression excluding the ontinued operation of the exception which prevailed under the previous acts, must be considered as having impliedly recognized the continued force of that exception; that is, must be held to have substantially made that exception a part of the rule established under the act of 1898. And this view, it is insisted, is expressly sustained by the following decided cases under the act of 1898: Re Green, 116 Fed. 118 (1902); Re Conrader, 118 Fed. 676 (1902); Conrader v. Cohen, 58 C. C. A. 249, 121 Fed. 801 (1903), affirming Re Conrader, supra; Re Janes, 128 Fed. 527 (1904), reversed in 67 C. C. A. 216, 133 Fed. 912; and by the present case, Re Gray, 208 Fed. 959 (1913), and is in reason supported by the adjudged cases which upheld the asserted exception under the prior acts.\n\n\n (c)\n That even if this be held to be not the case, as there is nothing in the act of 1898 repudiating the application and existence of the exception which prevailed under the previous acts, therefore, as a question of original investigation, that exception should be held to be equally applicable and controlling under the act now in force as it was under the previous bankruptcy acts, since the general rule was as clearly stated in those act as it is in this.\n A twofold reply is made to these contentions: First, although admitting that the alleged exception prevailed in England, it is denied that it was authoritatively recognized in this country under the previous acts, and second, by insisting that even if it was, it is not applicable under \n\n[240 U.S. 498, 505]\n\u00a0\n the act of 1898 because the terms of that act make manifest that it was drawn for the purpose of preventing the method of distribution provided in subsection f from being subject to the exception relied upon.\n As we are of opinion that it is to be conceded that if, under the prior acts, it was settled authoritatively and conclusively that the exception relied upon obtained and was fully recognized in practice, it would follow that the enactment of the same general rule without anything indicating a departure from the exception would justify the conclusion that it was the legislative intent to continue the exception, it results that, in order to answer the question propounded, the whole case comes to two inquiries: Was there such an authoritative exception to the general rule under the prior laws, and, if not, was the continued existence of such exception compatible with the rule of distribution established by subsection f of the present act as considered in the light of the context of  5 of which it forms a part, and of the scope and operation of the act of 1898?\n\n 1. \nUndoubtedly in England, with the development of the general rule for the distribution of partnership and individual estates in bankruptcy as now formulated in subsection f of the present bankruptcy act, there also was evolved in practice the socalled exception here relied upon which was applicable in cases where there was no partnership estate to distribute and no solvent partner. We content ourselves with this statement, and do not refer to the adjudged cases in England establishing the rule, and those from which the alleged exception came to be evolved, since they were quite fully referred to in Murrill v. Neill, 8 How. 414, 12 L. ed. 1135, and will all be found stated in the fullest degree in the opinion of Lowell, Judge, in Re Wilcox, 94 Fed. 84. It is also true that this asserted exception came to be recognized and applied in adjudged cases in this country under the prior bankruptcy acts. \n\n[240 U.S. 498, 506]\n\u00a0\n The cases on this subject again are not referred to because they will also be found stated in the opinion in the Wilcox Case. But, while this is true, we think there is no ground for saying that the asserted exception had become so authoritatively established prior to the adoption of the present law as to cause it to be in effect a part of the rule, since on the contrary, as will be seen by the references already made, its applicability was constantly disputed and its enforcement challeged. Nothing more is required to demonstrate this statement than a recurrence to Murrill v. Neill, supra, since in the opinion in that case, after considering the general rule of distribution as now stated in subsection f, and the alleged exception here under review, it was said: 'It may be proper in this place to mention the two departures permitted by the court of chancery in England from the general rule pursued by that court, which departures were adverted to in a previous part of this opinion.' After then stating the first exception, the one now in question was referred to as follows: 'The second is that in which there are no joint effects at all. In this last instance it is said that the joint creditors may come in for dividends pari passu on the separate effects; though if there be joint effects, though of the smallest possible amount, this privilege would not be allowed. These exceptions it seems difficult to reconcile with the reason or equity on which the general rule is founded; they are but exceptions, however, and cannot impair that rule. They do not, for aught we have seen, appear to have been recognized by the courts of this country.' p. 427.\n\n 2. \nAlthough the alleged exception was therefore clearly not so authoritatively established as to cause it to become a part of the rule by the enactment of the bankruptcy act of 1898, it yet remains to consider whether its existence is compatible with that act; that is, whether to permit it would be in accord with the rights which the act gave and the duty which it imposed be enforce them. In the first \n\n[240 U.S. 498, 507]\n\u00a0\n place it is to be observed that the act of 1898 in the opening subsections of  5 confers the power on courts of bankruptcy to adjudge a partnership a bankrupt and to administer the partnership estate so far as possible as any other estate,-an authority not conferred by the previous bankruptcy acts. In the second place, subsection f, establishing the rule of distribution, is immediately followed by subsection g, which provides as follows:\n'The court may permit the proof of the claim of the partnership estate against the individual estates, and vice versa, and may mershal the assets of the partnership estate and individual estates so as to prevent preferences and secure the equitable distribution of the property of the several estates.'\n\n The legislative mind must therefore have been immediately and directly concerned with the enforcement of the rule of distribution expressed in subsection f, since that subject was thus immediately considered and provided for. And the significance of this provision and its effect upon the continued existence of the supposed authority to depart from the rule expressly provided for by permitting the alleged exception now relied upon will become quite clear by the briefest possible outline of some of the principal considerations involved in the origin and development of that assumed exception.\n As pointed out in the opinion in Murrill v. Neill, supra, and as fully shown by the review of the English cases so carefully stated in Re Wilcox, supra, to which we again refer, that origin and development was this: It came to pass in England at an ancient date that with the establishment of the rule of distribution substantially as formulated in subsection f, it was recognized that a creditor of the joint or partnership estate would be permitted, if no objection was made, to prove his claim in a bankruptcy proceeding against an individual partner. This resulted from the fact that the power of the court over the \n\n[240 U.S. 498, 508]\n\u00a0\n separate or individual estate extended not only to the individual assets, but to the share of the individual bankrupt in the partnership assets, the court having power upon application, by ordering separate accounts to be kept, to protect the rights of all and secure a distribution conformably to the settled rule. While there is obscurity and consequent contrariety of opinion as to the reason upon which it was placed, it no doubt came to pass in a further state of evolution that both joint and separate creditors were allowed to prove their claims in bankruptcy against the separate estate, the practice of protecting the rights of each by an order requiring separate accounts disappearing and the creditors being relegated for the accomplishment of that result to a bill in equity to enforce and secure the distribution as provided in the rule. It is further certain that as in every case where an order was made allowing the joint creditor to prove against the separate estate of a partner such right would be frustrated by chancery proceedings, it came to pass that joint creditors were only allowed to prove against the separate estate upon condition that distribution would be made conformably with the general rule in every case where that course could be compelled by chancery proceedings. As it came further, however, to be appreciated that chancery could not afford relief in a case where there was no joint estate and no solvent partner, it resulted that in such a case the limitation as to distribution was treated as not applicable, and therefore the alleged exception to the general rule arose,-an exception which, as pointd out by this court in Murrill v. Neill, supra, was but a failure to give effect to the rule, not because of the absence of right of the creditors to enjoy its benefit, but alone because the judicial power had at its command no remedy which it could apply to give effect to the legal right which undoubtedly existed.\n When the origin and source of the so-called exception is thus appreciated and the comprehensive delegation of \n\n[240 U.S. 498, 509]\n\u00a0\n authority for the first time conferred by subsection g is considered, it would seem to be fairly inferable that at the very moment of the reexpression of the ancient rule in subsection f in terms free from ambiguity, the means of preventing its frustration in the guise of an exception or otherwise because of an assumed absence of judicial remedy to enforce the rule was provided for. And this being true, it of course results that no possible reason can be found for refusing to give effect to the law by permitting the successful operation of the so-called exception now relied upon. In fact, irrespective of the considerations derived from the origin of such assumed exception, to which we have referred, when the positive commands of the statute are considered and the new power conferred by the act as to partnership estates is borne in mind, we see no escape from the conclusion that the powers conferred by subsection g are coincident with the duties which the act imposes, and amply efficient to secure and give effect to their performance. This, indeed, was the view hitherto indicated in Miller v. New Orleans Acid & Fertilizer Co. \n211 U.S. 496\n, 53 L. ed. 300, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 176, where, after quoting subsection f of the act, it was said:\n'To enforce these provisions the act compels (subdiv. d) the keeping of separate accounts of the partnership property and of the property belonging to the individual partners; the payment (subdiv. e) of the bankrupt expenses as to the partnership and as to the individual property proportionately; and permits (subdiv. g) the proof of the claim of the partnership estate against the individual estate, and vice versa, and directs the marshaling of the assets of the partnership estate and the individual estates 'so as to prevent preferences and secure the equitable distribution of the property of the several estates.\" p. 504.\n\n It follows that the question propounded will be answered, Yes.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFARNHAM v. U S(1916)\nNo. 107\nArgued: March 2, 1916Decided: April 3, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 537, 538]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George W. Ramsey and Hosea B. Moulton for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Jughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The claimant, in the year 1906, brought his petition to recover upon the basis of an implied contract for the alleged use by the government of his patented invention, consisting of a stamp holder. The claim was for profits alleged to have been made between April 16, 1900, and June 30, 1905. Another petition was filed, in 1911, upon the same basis, to recover profits for the period between June 30, 1905, and June 30, 1910. Motion to consolidate the two suits, as involving the same issues, was granted. Upon hearing, the court made findings of fact, and held that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. 49 Ct. Cl. 19.\n The court found that, under date of January 4, 1898, Letters Patent No. 596,656 had been issued to the claimant for improvement in stamp holders. Models of the proposed stamp book and an explanatory pamphlet were submitted to the Third Assistant Postmaster-General with the suggestion that the Postoffice Department should adopt this method of handling and selling stamps. That officer, on June 17, 1898, returned the books to the claimant, saying: 'The Department does not deem it expedient to sell stamps in this way.' The claimant, on July 14, 1898, replied, stating that the descriptive pamphlet and the model stamp books formerly transmitted did not fully show the invention, and that he requested a personal interview. Two days later the government responded as follows: 'Your plan for booking and selling stamps is well understood; your explanation of it could not be clearer; but, as stated in a former letter to you, the \n\n[240 U.S. 537, 539]\n\u00a0\n Department does not wish to adopt it.' In June, 1899, the adoption of the claimant's device was again suggested to the Postoffice Department, and the Department replied that it adhered to its former decision. On July 1, 1899, Edwin C. Madden was appointed Third Assistant Postmaster-General, and he held office until March, 1907. Soon after his appointment he took under consideration the manufacture and sale of postage stamp books. He designed, without actual knowledge of the existence of the claimant's patent or of the correspondence with the Department relating to it, the stamp book now in departmental use. This stamp book was transmitted by Mr. Madden to the Bureau of Printing and Engraving with an inquiry as to the possibility of its manufacture, the details of manufacture being left to that Bureau. It prepared plans accordingly. After the public announcement that the Department would begin the public sale of two-cent stamps in book form, Mr. Madden learned for the first time that it was claimed that there were letters patent covering the proposed stamp book, and before issuing the same to the public he requested the Assistant Attorney General for the Department to examine all such claims and letters patent, and to advise him whether his book would constitute an infringement. The Assistant Attorney General advised him to proceed with the public sale as contemplated; that the stamp book to be issued was not covered by any previous patents. Both he and Mr. Madded examined the patents of the claimant, and Mr. Madden also examined the correspondence on file. From the beginning the latter insisted that the invention of the stamp book issued by the Department was his own, being independent of the claimant's patent. In March, 1909, the Third Assistant Postmaster-General addressed a letter to the claimant's attorney, expressly asserting that the Department's stamp book was not an infringement. It was in these circumstances that the government \n\n[240 U.S. 537, 540]\n\u00a0\n commenced the manufacture of its stamp books on March 26, 1900\n\n\n It is apparent that these facts furnished no basis for a finding of implied contract on the part of the government to pay for the use of the invention,-the only ground upon which the petitions were cognizable in the court of claims.

In this view, the consolidated petition was properly dismissed and it is unnecessary to consider the questions which have been argued with respect to actual use and the validity of the claimant's patent. The second petition related to a period extending to June 30, 1910, thus embracing five days after the approval of the act of June 25, 1910, chap. 423, 36 Stat. at L. 851, Comp. Stat. 1913 ,  9465, permitting the recovery from the government of reasonable compensation in cases of infringement. Crozier v. Fried.

This petition, however, like the first, did not purport to present a case within this act, but was rested solely upon implied contract. The judgment, however, should be without prejudice to the presentation of any claim the petitioner may have under the statute; and with this modification the judgment is affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIDELITY & DEPOSIT CO. OF MARYLAND v. COM. OF PENNSYLVANIA(1916)\nNo. 114\nArgued: January 6, 1916Decided: February 21, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles Markell and Charles F. Patterson for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. William M. Hargest and Mr. Francis Shunk Brown, Attorney General of Pennsylvania, for defendant in error. \n\n[240 U.S. 319, 320]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n We are asked to reverse a judgment of the supreme court of Pennsylvania which denied plaintiff in error's claim that, in becoming surety upon bonds required by the United States, it acted as a Federal instrumentality, and was not subject to taxation on the premiums received. 244 Pa. 67, 90 Atl. 437.\n Incorporated under the laws of Maryland, the Fidelity & Deposit Company is empowered by its charter to act as surety. It was duty licensed to transact business in Pennsylvania. In pursuance of the act of Congress referred to below, the Attorney General granted it authority to enter into obligations required by laws of the United States.\n Contracting within Pennsylvania, the company became surety, during 1909, on bonds in the following matters: 'Internal Revenue, customs, United States government officials, United States government contracts and banks for United States deposits, bonds given in courts of the United States in litigation there pending.' Gross premiums thereon amounting to $ 17,646.86 were collected. Within the same period it also became party to other bonds and received therefor $198,199.19. The state demanded 2 per centum of such total receipts, basing its claim on the proviso in  1, act of Assembly, June 28, 1895, P. L. 408, which declares: 'That hereafter the annual tax upon premiums of insurance companies of other states or foreign governments shall be at the rate of 2 per centum upon the gross premiums of every character and description received from business done within this commonwealth within the entire calendar year preceding.' The amount demanded because of premiums on bonds not authorized or required by the United States was paid; but liability for $352.92, assessed in respect of those so authorized, \n\n[240 U.S. 319, 321]\n\u00a0\n was denied, and to enforce it the present suit was instituted in the common pleas court, Dauphin county.\n The act of Congress entitled, 'An Act Relative to Recognizances, Stipulations, Bonds, and Undertakings, and to Allow Certain Corporations to be Accepted as Surety Thereon,' approved August 13, 1894 (chap. 282, 28 Stat. at L. 279, Comp. Stat. 1913,  3293), provided:\n Sec. 1. 'That whenever any recognizance, stipulation, bond or undertaking conditioned for the faithful performance of any duty, or for doing or refraining from doing anything in such recognizance, stipulation, bond, or undertaking specified, is by the laws of the United States required or permitted to be given with one surety or with two or more sureties, the execution of the same or the guarantying of the performance of the condition thereof shall be sufficient when executed or guaranteed solely by a corporation incorporated under the laws of the United States, or of any state having power to guarantee the fidelity of persons holding positions of public or private trust, and to execute and guarantee bonds and undertakings in judicial proceedings: Provided, That such recognizance, stipulation, bond, or undertaking be approved by the head of department, court, judge, officer, board, or body executive, legislative, or judicial required to approve or accept the same. But no officer or person having the approval of any bond shall exact that it shall be furnished by a guarantee company or by any particular guarantee company.'\n Sec. 2, that 'no such company shall do business under the provisions of this act beyond the limits of the state or territory under whose laws it was incorporated and in which its principal office is located . . . until it shall, by a written power of attorney, appoint some person residing within the jurisdiction of the court for the judicial district wherein such suretyship is to be undertaken, . . . as its agent, upon whom may be served \n\n[240 U.S. 319, 322]\n\u00a0\n all lawful process against such company, . . .' Sec. 3, that every company, before transacting business under the act, shall deposit with the Attorney General of the United State a copy of its charter and a statement showing assets and liabilities, and 'if the said Attorney General shall be satisfied that such company has authority under its charter to do the business provided for in this act, and that it has a paid-up capital of not less than $250,000 in cash or its equivalent, and is able to keep and perform its contracts, he shall grant authority in writing to such company to do business under this act.' Sec. 4, that quarterly statements shall be filed with the Attorney General, who shall have power to revoke the authority of any company 'whenever in his judgment such company is not solvent or is conducting its business in violation of this act.' Sec. 5, that 'any surety company doing business under the provisions of this act may be sued in respect thereof in any court of the United States' which has jurisdiction, in the district in which the instrument was made or guaranteed or the principal office of the company is located. Sec. 6, that 'all right to do business under this act' shall be forfeited upon failure to pay a final judgment against it. Sec. 7, that a company having executed any instrument under the act shall be estopped to deny its corporate power to execute same. Sec. 8, that penalties therein prescribed for failure to comply with the provisions of the act shall be recovered by suit.\n The court of common pleas held the tax 'is a charge for the privilege of transacting business in the state, measured by the amount of the business done;' there is 'nothing in the act of Congress to support the proposition that the defendant was authorized by it to transact its business in the state of Pennsylvania;' and in executing the specified bonds the surety company 'was in no sense an instrumentality of government.' Judgment was accordingly \n\n[240 U.S. 319, 323]\n\u00a0\n rendered for the state; and, on appeal, this was affirmed upon findings and opinion below.\n In behalf of plaintiff in error, counsel maintained that the taxing power of the state has been so exercised as to collide with operations of the Federal government; that under the act of Congress the surety company became a Federal instrumentality with power to execute bonds within the state, and consequently could not be subjected to a privilege tax therefor.\n That the challenged tax 'is an exaction for the privilege of doing business' seems plain (Equitable Life Assur. Soc. v. Pennsylvania, \n238 U.S. 143\n, 59 L. ed. 1239, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 829); and undoubtedly a state may not directly and materially hinder exercise of constitutional powers of the United States by demanding in opposition to the will of Congress that a Federal instrumentality pay a tax for the privilege of performing its functions. Farmers' & M. Sav. Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 U.S. 516\n, 58 L. ed. 706, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 354; Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. Harrison, \n235 U.S. 292\n, 59 L. ed. 234, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 27. But mere contracts between private corporations and the United States do not necessarily render the former essential governmental agencies, and confer freedom from state control. Baltimore Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. Baltimore, \n195 U.S. 375\n, 49 L. ed. 242, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50. Moreover, whatever may be their status, if the pertinent statute discloses the intention of Congress that such corporations, contracting under it with the Federal government, shall not be exempt from state regulation and taxation, they must submit thereto. First Nat. Bank v. Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353, 362, 19 L. ed. 701, 703; Van Allen v. Assessors (Churchill v. Utica), 3 Wall. 573, 585, 18 L. ed. 229, 235; Cooley, Taxn. 3d ed. pp. 130, 131.\n As revealed by its title, the purpose of the act of 1894 is 'to allow certain corporations to be accepted as surety, etc.' It does not undertake to endow any corporation with power, but only to permit those complying with specified conditions to exercise their lawful powers, derived from other sources, by contracting with the government \n\n[240 U.S. 319, 324]\n\u00a0\n under official approval. 'Power to guarantee,' required by  1, is not the same thing as 'authority under its charter' referred to in  3; and we think the clear intent was that existence of the former should be determined by the laws in force at place of contract. Neither circumstances nor language of the act indicate design or necessity to limit application by the several states of a well-established system of licensing and taxing bonding companies not incorporated under their own statutes. Plaintiff in error's right to carry on business in Pennsylvania depended upon compliance with its laws.\n We find no error in the judgment of the court below and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFLEITMANN v. WELSBACH STREET LIGHTING CO. OF AMERICA(1916)\nNo. 145\nArgued: December 17, 1915Decided: January 24, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. Henry L. Scheuerman, Henry A. Wise, and Harry F. Mela for appellant.\n Messrs. Edward W. Hatch and William F. Sheehan for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill by a stockholder of the Consolidated Street Lighting Company, against that company and a number \n\n[240 U.S. 27, 28]\n\u00a0\n of other corporations and individuals, to compel the defendants other than his own company to pay to the latter threefold damages under the Sherman act. July 2, 1890, chap. 647,  7, 26 Stat. at L. 209, 210, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8820, 8829. According to the allegations the other defendants conspired to control the business of municipal lighting, etc., throughout the United States, and in pursuance of their conspiracy procured their agent to purchase from the former owners a majority of the stock in the plaintiff's company, and then proceeded to ruin it and drive it out of business by misconducting its affairs. The plaintiff has demanded of his company and its officers to institute proceedings, but they have refused. The bill was dismissed by the district court on motion of the appellees in the two appeals before this court, and the decree was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 128 C. C. A. 31, 211 Fed. 103.\n The bill alleges in terms that it is brought to recover threefold the damages alleged; a decree for such damages was the decree prayed. The only specific error assigned on appeal to the circuit court of appeals was holding that such a suit in equity could not be maintained by a single stockholder; that was the only question dealt with by the district court, and that was the ground of decision in the circuit court of appeals. It really is the only question in the case.\n Of course the claim set up is that of the corporation alone, and if the corporation were proceeding directly under the statute no one can doubt that its only remedy would be at law. Therefore the inquiry at once arises why the defendants' right to a jury trial should be taken away because the present plaintiff cannot persuade the only party having a cause of action to sue,-how the liability which is the principal matter can be converted into an incident of the plaintiff's domestic difficulties with the company that has been wronged.\n No doubt there are cases in which the nature of the \n\n[240 U.S. 27, 29]\n\u00a0\n right asserted for the company, or the failure of the defendants concerned to insist upon their rights, or a different state system, has led to the whole matter being disposed of in equity; but we agree with the courts below that when a penalty of triple damages is sought to be inflicted, the statute should not be read as attempting to authorize liability to be enforced otherwise than through the verdict of a jury in a court of common law. On the contrary, it plainly provides the latter remedy, and it provides no other. Pollard v. Bailey, 20 Wall. 520, 22 L. ed. 376. Even the act of October 15, 1914, chap. 323,  16, 38 Stat. at L. 730, 737, passed since this suit was begun, does not go farther in terms than to give an injunction to private persons against threatened loss.\n It now is suggested, evidently as an afterthought since the decision in the district court, that there might be a decree directing the corporation to sue, or, if it fails to do so, permitting the plaintiff to sue in its name and on its behalf. But the bill is not framed for that purpose, as the court below held.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Pitney dissent. \n\n\n\n","67":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nG. & C. MERRIAM CO. v. SAALFIELD(1916)\nNo. 178\nArgued: Decided: April 17, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 22, 23]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William B. Hale and James A. Ford for appellant.\n Messrs. Wade H. Ellis and Challen B. Ellis for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a direct appeal from the district court under  238, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1215], upon the sole question of the jurisdiction \n\n[241 U.S. 22, 24]\n\u00a0\n of that court to make and enforce a final decree in personam against appellee George W. Ogilvie. The decree was founded upon a supplemental bill making Ogilvie a party to a suit already pending, and upon substituted service of process on persons said to represent him as attorneys in the state of Ohio, he being a citizen and resident of the state of New York, and not having been personally served.\n The facts are as follows: In December, 1908, appellant filed its original bill against Saalfield in the then circuit court of the United, States for the northern district of Ohio, for relief against unfair competition in the business of publishing and selling dictionaries. Saalfield was duly served with process, appeared, and made defense. The circuit court having dismissed the bill, the circuit court of appeals reversed the decree (111 C. C. A. 517, 190 Fed. 927, 117 C. C. A. 245, 198 Fed. 369), and remanded the cause, with direction for an injunction and an accounting in conformity with its opinion. The district court made a decree in accordance with the mandate September 11, 1912, with an order of reference for the accounting. Thereafter and on December 16, 1912, the supplemental bill was filed, setting up in substance that since the entry of the decree of September 11 complainant had discovered, and it charged the fact to be, that Ogilvie had from the beginning actively conducted, controlled, and directed the defense of the suit, having selected, retained, and paid, as solicitors and counsel for defendant Saalfield, the firm of Weed, Miller, & Nason, of Cleveland, Ohio, and Mr. George F. Bean, of Boston, Massachusetts, who, in pursuance of said retainer, appeared on behalf of Saalfield, but acted for and under instructions of Ogilvie; that in fact Ogilvie was the proprietor of the dictionaries involved in the suit, which were published and sold for his benefit and profit by Saalfield under a contract providing for the payment of royalties to Ogilvie; that pending the suit Saalfield had \n\n[241 U.S. 22, 25]\n\u00a0\n transferred and assigned to the Saalfield Publishing Company, a corporation, his business of publishing and selling the dictionaries; that the company, as successor of and claiming through and under Saalfield, was bound by all the proceedings in the suit, and that it was then carrying on the business, under contract with Ogilvie; and that, by reason of the facts mentioned, Ogilvie had made himself privy to the suit, and an actual though not a nominal party thereto, and was bound by the proceedings and decree therein. Appropriate relief was prayed against Saalfield, the Saalfield Publishing Company, and Ogilvie.\n Upon the filing of the supplemental bill and an affidavit setting forth that Ogilvie was a nonresident of the northern district of Ohio, and that, as alleged in the supplemental bill, the firm of Weed, Miller, & Nason, of Cleveland, and George F. Bean, of Boston, Massachusetts, who had appeared respectively as solicitors and counsel for defendant Saalfield in the defense of the suit, were in fact retained and employed by Ogilvie for that purpose, and paid by him and acted under his instructions and directions, complainant moved for and obtained an order authorizing substituted service of process against Ogilvie, to be made within the district upon the Cleveland attorneys, and in the district of Massachusetts upon George F. Bean. Service was made accordingly, and the process returned; and it appearing from an affidavit made by defendant Ogilvie, and filed in the cause on February 22, 1913, that he had had actual notice of the supplemental bill, an interlocutory decree pro confesso was entered, and this was followed, on October 16, 1913, by a final decree for the recovery against him of profits amounting, with interest, to $81,312.78, besides costs. Thereafter Ogilvie, by solicitors, appearing specially for the purpose, moved to quash the service of the writ of subpoena issued against him, and to set aside all proceedings based thereon. The district court, having heard testimony, granted the \n\n[241 U.S. 22, 26]\n\u00a0\n motion, and at the same time denied a petition filed by complainant for enforcement of the final decree against Ogilvie; and from final orders entered for carrying into effect this decision, complainant has appealed to this court.\n There is a motion to dismiss, based upon the familiar ground that the 'jurisdiction of the court' referred to in  238, Judicial Code, means its jurisdiction as a Federal court, and not its general jurisdiction as a judicial tribunal; the insistence being that the contention of complainant below presented no more than a general question of procedure in equity, and not one peculiar to the district court as a Federal court. But the distinction referred to bears upon the nature of the jurisdiction exercised or refused to be exercised after a valid service of process upon the defendant, and does not affect the question whether the court has acquired jurisdiction over the person, which is the one here involved. This question may be reviewed on direct appeal. Shepard v. Adams, \n168 \nU.S. 618, 623\n, 42 S. L. ed. 602, 603, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 214; Remington v. Central P. R. Co. \n198 \nU.S. 95, 99\n, 49 S.

Rep. 547, the decision that was held not reviewable on direct appeal was rendered upon a plea to the jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter. In Courtney v. Pradt, \n196 U.S. 89\n, 49 L. ed. 398, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 208, the suit had been removed from a Kentucky state court to the United States circuit court, where Pradt filed a special demurrer, assigning as causes that the court had no jurisdiction of the person or of the subject-matter. The court dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction, and it appeared from its opinion that this was done because Pradt, who was sued as executor, was appointed as such in Wisconsin, and a suit against a Wis- \n\n[241 U.S. 22, 27]\n\u00a0\n consin executor could not be maintained in the Kentucky state court, nor in the Federal court. The question of jurisdiction was not certified to this court, and the appeal was therefore dismissed. These cases are plainly distinguishable. The present motion to dismiss must be denied.\n Appellant's case upon the merits is rested upon the theory that Ogilvie was privy to the original suit against Saalfield, and an actual though not an ostensible party thereto, in such a real sense that the final decree therein would be res judicata against him; that the district court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit as against him notwithstanding he resided outside the district, because by voluntarily coming in and defending for Saalfield, he had submitted to the jurisdiction and waived the objection, and because the supplemental bill was a dependant and ancillary proceeding, and therefore properly brought in the district wherein the original proceeding was pending; and, finally, that because of its being an ancillary proceeding, substituted service upon the solicitors representing Ogilvie in the original proceeding was sufficient to subject him to the jurisdiction for the purposes of the supplemental bill. There is a faint attempt to sustain the jurisdiction on the theory that Ogilvie's affidavit, filed February 22, 1913, as mentioned in the interlocutory decree pro confesso, amounted to a general appearance, because it was submitted in opposition to a motion for injunction on the supplemental bill, and because it 'argued the case upon the merits.' This may be overruled at once. The affidavit shows on its face that it was to be used only as evidence for defendants Saalfield and the Publishing Company, and was not to be construed as an appearance by Ogilvie.\n The district court, while raising some question whether the solicitors and counsel who had appeared for Saalfield at Ogilvie's expense had not concluded their services in \n\n[241 U.S. 22, 28]\n\u00a0\n Ogilvie's behalf prior to the filing of the supplemental bill, yet rested its decision substantially upon the ground that complainant did not know that Ogilvie had any connection with Saalfield or the Saalfield Publishing Company until after the making of the decree of September 11, 1912, upon the going down of the mandate from the circuit court of appeals; and that for this reason Ogilvie could not have taken advantage of that decree had it been adverse to complainant, and therefore was not estopped by it, since estoppels must be mutual.\n In so holding, the court applied the doctrine that has been laid down in a number of cases, that a third party does not become bound by a decree because of his participation in the defense unless his conduct in that regard was open and avowed or otherwise known to the opposite party, so that the latter would have been concluded by an adverse judgment.

We need not consider the soundness of the doctrine, for appellant does not question it, insisting only that it is not applicable here because Ogilvie's control of the defense made in Saalfield's name became known to appellant during the progress of the suit, and before final decree; it being contended that the decree of September 11, 1912, was interlocutory, and not final.\n But it is familiar law that only a final judgment is res judicata as between the parties. And it is evident that a decree cannot be res judicata as against a third party participating in the defense unless it is so far final as to be res judicata against the defendant himself. Hence, if the decree of September 11 was not final as between appellant and Saalfield, it cannot be res judicata as against Ogilvie; and thus the fundamental ground for proceeding against the latter by supplemental bill with substituted service of process disappears. This sufficiently shows the weakness of appellant's position, which, upon analysis, is \n\n[241 U.S. 22, 29]\n\u00a0\n found to be this: that upon the theory that Ogilvie would be estopped by a final decree if and when made, it sought to bring him into the suit, before final decree, as if he were already estopped. However convenient this might be to a complainant in appellant's position, it is inconsistent with elementary principles.\n But, assuming for argument's sake that the decree was final, and that Ogilvie was fully estopped by it because of having taken charge and exercised control of Saalfield's defense through solicitors and counsel retained and paid by himself; and assuming that their employment had not been terminated at the time the supplemental bill was filed,-the question of the sufficiency of the proceedings taken by way of substituted service to bring Ogilvie within the jurisdiction of the court still remains, and this depends upon whether the supplemental bill is a dependent and ancillary proceeding, jurisdiction of which follows jurisdiction of the original cause, and may be exerted upon mere notice to the party, without service or original process within the district. It seems to be thought that because Ogilvie was identified in interest with the defendant in the original suit, and had and exercised the right to make defense and control the proceedings and appeal from the decree, he may be treated for all purposes as an actual party to the record. But this by no means follows. The doctrine of res judicata furnishes a rule for the decision of a subsequent case between the same parties or their privies respecting the same cause of action. Obviously, the rule for decision applies only when the subsequent action has been brought. So far as the supplemental bill seeks to bring in Ogilvie as a new party and obtain relief against him, it is not, in any proper sense, dependent upon or ancillary to the original suit against Saalfield. It is not analogous to a suit for an injunction against the prosecution of a previous suit or the enforcement of a judgment therein. It has not \n\n[241 U.S. 22, 30]\n\u00a0\n for its object some further dealing with the same subject-matter. Ogilvie is not in the position of one who, pending a suit about property, has acquired an interest in the subject-matter. The object of the original bill was to obtain an injunction and recover profits from Saalfield; that of the supplemental bill is to obtain an injunction and an accounting of profits against Ogilvie respecting the same transactions. But the merits are not to be adjudicated against him until he is brought into court, and as against him the supplemental bill is an original, not an ancillary, proceeding. In Dunn v. Clarke, 8 Pet. 1, 8 L. ed. 845, one Graham had recovered a judgment at law in an action of ejectment against the complainants, Clarke and others, in the United States circuit court, jurisdiction depending upon diversity of citizenship. Graham having died, the defendant, Dunn, held the land recovered in trust under his will. Clarke and others filed their bill in the same court, praying for an injunction against the judgment and for a decree that the land in controversy be reconveyed. All the complainants and defendants were residents of the same state (Ohio). This court said: 'No doubt is entertained by the court that jurisdiction of the case may be sustained, so far as to stay execution on the judgment at law against Dunn. He is the representative of Graham; and although he is a citizen of Ohio, yet this fact, under the circumstances, will not deprive this court of an equitable control over the judgment. But beyond this, the decree of this court cannot extend. Of the action at law, the circuit court had jurisdiction; and no change in the residence or condition of the parties can take away a jurisdiction which has once attached. If Graham had lived, the circuit court might have issued an injunction to his judgment at law, without a personal service of process, except on his counsel; and as Dunn is his representative, the court may do the same thing, as against him. The injunction \n\n[241 U.S. 22, 31]\n\u00a0\n bill is not considered an original bill between the same parties, as at law: but, if other parties are made in the bill, and different interests involved, it must be considered, to that extent at least, an original bill; and the jurisdiction of the circuit court must depend upon the citizenship of the parties. In the present case, several persons are made defendants who were not parties or privies to the suit at law, and no jurisdiction as to them can be exercised by this or the circuit court.' So far as it shows the distinction between an original bill and one that is not to be so considered, the case is in point upon the present question. The reference to 'privies' must be taken in connection with the subject-matter, which in that case was the ownership of land.\n No case to which we are referred, nor any other that we have found,1 goes to the extent of sustaining as an ancillary proceeding a bill interposed for the purpose of obtaining a decree in personam against a party upon the ground that he had participated in the defense of a previous action against another party so as to become bound upon the doctrine of res judicata. Kelley v. T. L. Smith Co. (C. C. A. 7th) 117 C. C. A. 240, 196 Fed. 466, is referred to. In that case Kelley, a citizen of New York, and McConnell, a citizen of Illinois, had commenced an action in a Wisconsin state court to compel the secretary of the Smith \n\n[241 U.S. 22, 32]\n\u00a0\n Company to transfer certain shares of stock standing in Kelley's name to McConnell, as his assignee. A firm of Milwaukee attorneys brought the action, and an attorney connected with that firm was in possession of the certificate as agent of McConnell. Thereupon the company and its secretary filed in the United States circuit court a bill asserting that the equitable title to the shares was involved in a suit already pending in that court, to which the company was a party defendant; that thus different parties, in different courts, were insisting that complainants transfer the same shares to each, and if complainants should comply with the demand of either they would be unable to transfer the shares to the other if so ordered by a court decree, and that they had no interest in the shares, and were willing to transfer them to the party found to be the owner. On the showing that Kelley and McConnell were not to be found in the district, and that the stock certificates was within the district, in the hands of their attorneys and agent having authority to assert and preserve their rights, the court ordered the subpoena and the notice of application for an interlocutory injunction to be served, and they were served, upon said attorneys and agent. The circuit court overruled a demurrer, and the court of appeals sustained this decree, not, however, upon the ground that the suit was an ancillary proceeding in aid of the court's jurisdiction in a pending suit, but upon the ground that, as an independent and original bill, it presented a subject cognizable in a circuit court of the United States, and that although jurisdiction in personam could not be acquired by service of process under equity rule 13, because of the absence of the defendants, substituted service was permissible under the then equity rule 90, by analogy to the English practice. Without intimating any view as to the correctness of this reasoning, it is sufficient to say that the decision has no pertinency to the question here presented. \n\n[241 U.S. 22, 33]\n\u00a0\n Upon these grounds, we are of opinion that substituted service of process against Ogilvie was inadmissible, and that the District Court did not err in quashing the service and setting aside the proceedings based thereon, nor in refusing appellant's petition for enforcement of the decree against him.\n Final orders affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Milwaukee & M.

The plaintiff, defendant in error, did the work, received an assignment of the tax, and got a judgment for the amount. The only question here is whether the ordinance levying the tax under the charter of the city is consistent with the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The charter provides that one fourth of the total cost shall be levied upon all the property fronting upon or adjoining the improvement according to frontage and three fourths according to area upon all the property in the district, ascertained as follows: 'A line shall be drawn midway between the street to be improved and the next parallel or converging street on each side of the street to be improved, which line shall be the boundary of the district, except as hereinafter provided, namely: If the property adjoining the street to be improved is divided into lots, the district line shall be so drawn as to include the entire depth of all lots fronting on the street to be improved. . . . If there is no parallel or converging street on either side of the street improved, the district lines shall be drawn 300 feet from and parallel to the street to be improved; but if there be a parallel or converging street on one side of the street to be improved to fix and locate the district line, then the district line on the other side shall be drawn parallel to the street to be \n\n[240 U.S. 55, 58]\n\u00a0\n improved and at the average distance of the opposite district line so fixed and located.' The defendants' land has a frontage on the west side of Broadway of 1,083.88 feet out of a total in the district constituted said to be 4,372 feet. It is an undivided tract extending back nearly a thousand feet to Church road. On the south the adjoining property was divided into lots of small depth, and on the opposite side of Broadway the next parallel street was about 300 feet from Broadway. The ordinance establishing the taxing district treated Church road as the next parallel street within the meaning of the charter, and included the defendants' tract to a depth of between 400 and 500 feet, while the small lots next to it were included to only about 100 feet, the opposite lots to about 150 feet, and another undivided tract on the east of Broadway was included by average distance to a depth of 240 feet. The ordinance establishing these lines was held to follow the charter and to be consistent with the 14th Amendment by the supreme court of the state. 259 Mo. 153, 168 S. W. 687.\n The legislature may create taxing districts to meet the expense of local improvements, and may fix the basis of taxation without encountering the 14th Amendment unless its action is palpably arbitrary or a plain abuse. Houck v. Little River Drainage Dist. \n239 \nU.S. 254, 262\n, 60 S. L. ed . --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 58. The front-foot rule has been sanctioned for the cost of paving a street. In such a case it is not likely that the cost will exceed the benefit, and the law does not attempt an imaginary exactness, or go beyond the reasonable probabilities. French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. \n181 U.S. 324\n, 45 L. ed. 879, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625; Cass Farm Co. v. Detroit, \n181 \nU.S. 396, 397\n, 45 S. L. ed. 914, 915, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644. So in the case of a square bounded by principal streets, the land might be assessed half way back from the improvement to the next street. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. \n197 U.S. 430\n, 49 L. ed. 819, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 466. But, as is implied by Houck v. Little River Drainage Dist., if the \n\n[240 U.S. 55, 59]\n\u00a0\n law is of such a character that there is no reasonable presumption that substantial justice generally will be done, but the probability is that the parties will be taxed disproportionately to each other and to the benefit conferred, the law cannot stand against the complaint of one so taxed in fact. Martin v. District of Columbia, \n205 \nU.S. 135, 139\n, 51 S. L. ed. 743, 744, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 440.\n The city of St. Louis is shown by this case and by others in the Missouri reports to contain tracts not yet cut into city lots, extending back from streets without encountering a parallel street much farther than the distance within which paving could be supposed to be a benefit. See, for instance, Gilsonite Roofing & Paving Co. v. St. Louis Fair Asso. 231 Mo. 589, 132 S. W. 657; Granite Bituminous Paving Co. v. Fleming, 251 Mo. 210, 158 S. W. 4; Loth v. St. Louis, 257 Mo. 399, 165 S. W. 1023; William R. Bush Constr. Co. v. Withnell, 185 Mo. App. 408, 170 S. W. 361. The ordinance, following the charter as construed, established a line determining the proportions in which the tax was to be borne that, after running not a hundred feet from the street, leaped to near 500 feet when it encountered such a tract, and on the opposite side of the street was 150 and 240 feet away. The differences were not based upon any consideration of difference in the benefits conferred, but were established mechanically in obedience to the criteria that the charter directed to be applied. The defendants' case is not an incidental result of a rule that, as a whole and on the average, may be expected to work well, but of an ordinance that is a farrago of irrational irregularities throughout. It is enough to say that the ordinance following the orders of the charter is bad upon its face as distributing a local tax in grossly unequal proportions, not because of special considerations applicable to the parcels taxed, but in blind obedience to a rule that requires the result. And it cannot be said that the ordinance as a whole may be regarded as an individual \n\n[240 U.S. 55, 60]\n\u00a0\n exception under a rule that promises justice in all ordinary cases. The charter provisions as applied to a city like St. Louis must be taken to contemplate such ordinances under the construction given to it by the state courts.\n Judgment reversed.\n By stipulation of counsel the same judgment will be entered in case No. 210. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGEORGIA, F. & A. RY. CO. v. BLISH MILLING CO.(1916)\nNo. 292\nArgued: Decided: May 8, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 190, 191]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. T. S. Hawes, Alexander Akerman, and Charles Akerman for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. A. L. Miller and E. M. Donalson for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 190, 192]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Blish Milling Company brought this action in trover against the Georgia, Florida, & Alabama Railway Company, and recovered judgment, which was affirmed by the court of appeals of Georgia. 15 Ga. App. 142, 82 S. E. 784. The facts are these:\n On May 13, 1910, the Blish Milling Company shipped from Seymour, Indiana, to Bainbridge, Georgia, a carload of flour consigned to its own order, with direction to notify Draper-Garrett Grocery Company at Bainbridge. The bill of lading was issued by the Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Railroad Company. The shipper's sight draft upon the Draper- Garrett Grocery Company, for $1,109.89, covering the price of the flour, with a carrying charge, was attached to the bill of lading and forwarded to a bank in Bainbridge for collection. The flour was transferred to another car by the Central of Georgia Railway Company, a connecting carrier, and reached Bainbridge on June 2, 1910, over the line of the Georgia, Florida, & Alabama Railway Company, the plaintiff in error, in accordance with routing. The plaintiff in error, without requiring payment of the draft and surrender of the bill \n\n[241 U.S. 190, 193]\n\u00a0\n of lading (which were ultimately returned to the Blish Milling Company), delivered the car to the Draper-Garrett Grocery Company immediately on its arrival by placing it on the sidetrack of that company. In the course of unloading, the Grocery Company discovered that some of the flour was wet, and thereupon reloaded the part removed and returned the flour to the plaintiff in error. The subsequent course of events is thus stated by the court of appeals (id. pp. 144, 145):\n'The railway company' (that is, the plaintiff in error) 'retook possession of the car and unloaded it, and in a few days sold, as perishable property, a part of the flour alleged to be damaged, and on December 23, 1910, sold the remainder. On June 3, 1910, after the Grocery Company had turned the flour back to the railway company, B. C. Prince, traffic manager of the Georgia, Florida, & Alabama Railway Company, telegraphed to the Blish Milling Company as follows: 'Flour order notify Draper-Garrett Grocery Company refused account damage. Hold at your risk and expense. Advise disposition.' On the next day the Miling Company replied by telegraphing to Prince, 'Sending our representative there. What is nature of damage?' To this Prince replied: 'Flour transferred in route. Slight damage by water, apparently rough handling. When will your representative reach Bainbridge?' The Blish Milling Company replied that its man would be there that night or the next day. On June 7 (after the Milling Company's representative had reached Bainbridge and conferred with the agents of the railway company and with the Grocery Company) the Milling Company sent a final telegram, saying, 'We will make claim against railroad for entire contents of car at invoice price. Must refuse shipment as we cannot handle.' It appears, from the evidence of Mr. Draper, that the price of flour declined after his order was given and before the flour reached Bainbridge. There \n\n[241 U.S. 190, 194]\n\u00a0\n is conflict in the evidence as to a tender of the flour by the railway company to the Milling Company's representative. According to some of the testimony, about 18 barrels of the flour had been sold by the railway company before the alleged tender was made, and therefore it was not within the power of the carrier to tender the shipment in its entirety.' The verdict in favor of the Milling Company was for $1,084.50, from which the court of appeals required a deduction of the amount of the unpaid freight, which was held to have been erroneously included.\n\n With other defenses the railway company pleaded that the shipper had failed to comply with the following provision of the bill of lading, issued by the initial carrier: 'Claims for loss, damage, or delay must be made in writing to the carrier at the point of delivery or at the point of origin within four months after the delivery of the property, or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within four months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Unless claims are so made, the carrier shall not be liable.' This defense was overruled. The court of appeals stated that 'so far as appears from the record, no claim was filed by the shipper,' but deemed the provision to be inapplicable. Id. p. 149.\n There are only two questions presented here, and these are thus set forth in the brief of the plaintiff in error:\n'1st. That the plaintiff's exclusive remedy was against the initial carrier, the Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Railroad Company, under the Carmack amendment of  20 of the Hepburn bill [34 Stat. at L. 593, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8592].\n\n'2d. That, under the stipulation in the bill of lading providing for the filing of claims for loss or damage, the action was barred.'\n\n The first contention is met by repeated decisions of this court. The connecting carrier is not relieved from liability by the Carmack amendment, but the bill of lading required to be issued by the initial carrier upon \n\n[241 U.S. 190, 195]\n\u00a0\n an interstate shipment governs the entire transportation, and thus fixes the obligations of all participating carriers to the extent that the terms of the bill of lading are applicable and valid. 'The liability of any carrier in the route over which the articles were routed, for loss or damage, is that imposed by the act as measured by the original contract of shipment, so far as it is valid under the act.' Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, \n227 \nU.S. 639, 648\n, 57 S. L. ed. 683, 686, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391. See Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 \nU.S. 491, 507\n, 508 S., 57 L. ed. 314, 320, 321, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148; Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Dettlebach, \n239 \nU.S. 588, 591\n, 60 S.

Wall, decided April 24, 1916 [\n241 U.S. 87\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493].\n These decisions also established that the question as to the proper construction of the bill of lading is a Federal question. The clause with respect to the notice of claims-upon which the plaintiff in error relies in its second contention-specifically covers 'failure to make delivery.' It is said that this is not to be deemed to include a case where there was not only failure to deliver to the consignee, but actual delivery to another, or delivery in violation of instruction. But 'delivery' must mean delivery as required by the contract, and the terms of the stipulation are comprehensive,-fully adequate in their literal and natural meaning to cover all cases where the delivery has not been made as required. When the goods have been misdelivered there is as clearly a 'failure to make delivery' as when the goods have been lost or destroyed; and it is quite as competent in the one case as in the other for the parties to agree upon reasonable notice of the claim as a condition of liability. It may be urged that the carrier is bound to know whether it has delivered to the right person or according to instructions. This argument, however, even with respect to the particular carrier which makes a misdelivery, loses sight of the practical object in view. In fact, the transactions of a railroad company are multitudinous, and are carried on \n\n[241 U.S. 190, 196]\n\u00a0\n through numerous employees of various grades. Ordinarily the managing officers, and those responsible for the settlement and contest of claims, would be without actual knowledge of the facts of a particular transaction. The purpose of the stipulation is not to escape liability, but to facilitate prompt investigation. And, to this end, it is a precaution of obvious wisdom, and in no respect repugnant to public policy, that the carrier by its contracts should require reasonable notice of all claims against it even with respect to its own operations.\n There is, however, a further and controlling consideration. We are dealing with a clause in a bill of lading issued by the initial carrier. The statute casts upon the initial carrier responsibility with respect to the entire transportation. The aim was to establish unity of responsibility (Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, \n219 U.S. 186\n, 199-203, 55 L. ed. 167, 179-181, 31 L.R.A.(N.S.) 7, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164; New York, P. & N. R. Co. v. Peninsula Produce Exch., \n240 \nU.S. 34, 38\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 230), and the words of the statute are comprehensive enough to embrace responsibility for all losses resulting from any failure to discharge a carrier's duty as to any part of the agreed transportation, which, as defined in the Federal act, includes delivery. It is not to be doubted that if, in the case of an interstate shipment under a through bill of lading, the terminal carrier makes a misdelivery, the initial carrier is liable; and when it inserts in its bill of lading a provision requiring reasonable notice of claims 'in case of failure to make delivery,' the fair meaning of the stipulation is that it includes all cases of such failure, as well those due to misdelivery as those due to the loss of the goods. But the provision in question is not to be construed in one way with respect to the initial carrier, and in another with respect to the connecting or terminal carrier. As we have said, the latter takes the goods under the bill of lading issued by the initial carrier, and its obligations are measured by its terms (Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, \n227 \nU.S. 639, 648\n, 57 S. L. ed. 683, 686, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391; Southern \n\n[241 U.S. 190, 197]\n\u00a0\n R. Co. v. Prescott, \n240 \nU.S. 632, 637\n, 60 S. L. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 469); and if the clause must be deemed to cover a case of misdelivery when the action is brought against the initial carrier, it must equally have that effect in the case of the terminal carrier, which, in the contemplation of the parties, was to make the delivery. The clause gave abundant opportunity for presenting claims, and we regard it as both applicable and valid.\n In this view, it necessarily follows that the effect of the stipulation could not be escaped by the mere form of the action. The action is in trover, but, as the state court said: 'If we look beyond its technical denomination, the scope and effect of the action is nothing more than that of an action for damages against the delivering carrier.' 15 Ga. App. p. 147. It is urged, however, that the carrier, in making the misdelivery, converted the flour and thus abandoned the contract. But the parties could not waive the terms of the contract under which the shipment was made pursuant to the Federal act; nor could the carrier by its conduct give the shipper the right to ignore these terms which were applicable to that conduct, and hold the carrier to a different responsibility from that fixed by the agreement made under the published tariffs and regulations. A different view would antagonize the plain policy of the act and open the door to the very abuses at which the act was aimed. Chicago & A. R. Co. v. Kirby, \n225 \nU.S. 155, 166\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1033, 1038, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 501; Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, supra; Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Robinson, \n233 \nU.S. 173, 181\n, 58 S. L. ed. 901, 905, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 556; Southern R. Co. v. Prescott, supra. We are not concerned in the present case with any question save as to the applicability of the provision, and its validity, and as we find it to be both applicable and valid, effect must be given to it.\n But, while this is so, we think that the plaintiff in error is not entitled to succeed in its ultimate contention under the stipulation for the reason that it appears that notice \n\n[241 U.S. 190, 198]\n\u00a0\n of the claim was in fact given. It is true that in the statement made by the court of appeals it is said that, so far as appears from the record, 'no claim was filed by the shipper.' We must assume, however, that this was in effect a construction of the provision as requiring a more formal notice than that which was actually sent. For the court had already set forth the uncontroverted facts in detail showing that the shipper (having made an investigation in response to the communication of the traffic manager of the railway company) had telegraphed to the latter, on June 7, 1910, only five days after the arrival of the goods at destination, as follows: 'We will make claim against railroad for entire contents of car at invoice price. Must refuse shipment as we cannot handle.' In the preceding telegrams which passed between the parties, and are detailed by the state court in stating the facts, the shipment had been adequately identified, so that this final telegram, taken with the others, established beyond question the particular shipment to which the claim referred, and was in substance the making of a claim within the meaning of the stipulation,-the object of which was to secure reasonable notice. We think that it sufficiently apprised the carrier of the character of the claim, for while it stated that the claim was for the entire contents of the car 'at invoice price,' this did not constitute such a variance from the claim for the value of the flour as to be misleading; and it is plain that no prejudice resulted. Granting that the stipulation is applicable and valid, it does not require documents in a particular form. It is addressed to a practical exigency and it is to be construed in a practical way. The stipulation required that the claim should be made in writing, but a telegram which, in itself, or taken with other telegrams, contained an adequate statement, must be deemed to satisfy this requirement.

Hutchings for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Napoleon B. Maxey and Charles F. Runyan for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a suit to set aside a will probated in common form, and to avoid its probate. The suit was begun in the United States court for the Indian Territory, wherein the will had been probated, and was transferred to an Oklahoma court when that state was admitted into the Union. The plaintiff ultimately prevailed and the supreme court \n\n[241 U.S. 99, 100]\n\u00a0\n of the state affirmed the judgment. 38 Okla. 596, 134 Pac. 859, 43 Okla. 267, 142 Pac. 755.\n The Federal question in the case is whether certain statutes bearing upon such a suit were put in force in the Indian Territory by the act of May 2, 1890, chap. 182,  31, 26 Stat. at L. 81, whereby Congress adopted and extended over the Indian Territory certain general laws of Arkansas 'in force at the close of the session of the general assembly of that state of 1883, as published in 1884 in the volume known as Mansfield's Digest,' where 'not locally inapplicable or in conflict with' that or some other act of Congress. In Arkansas there were probate courts and courts of general jurisdiction designated as circuit courts, while for the Indian Territory only one court had been established at that time, and it was a court of general jurisdiction. In view of this the act declared that 'the United States court in the Indian Territory herein referred to shall have and exercise the powers of courts of probate under said laws,' and 'wherever in said laws of Arkansas the courts of record of said state are mentioned the said court in the Indian Territory shall be substituted therefor.'\n Among the Arkansas laws enumerated in the act was chapter 155, containing sections numbered from 6490 to 6548. The section under which the will was probated declares:\n'Sec. 6522. When any will shall be exhibited for probate, the court of probate . . . may and shall receive the probate thereof in common form, without summoning any party, and shall grant a certificate of probate, or, if the will be rejected, shall grant a certificate of rejection; . . .'\n\n Other sections (6509 and 6521) provide for an appeal to the circuit court from an order of the probate court establishing or rejecting a will, and for bringing in parties and giving a hearing de novo upon the appeal. The sections under which the suit was brought read as follows: \n\n[241 U.S. 99, 101]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 6523. Any person interested who, at the time of the final decision in the circuit court, resided out of this state, and was proceeded against by order of appearance only, without actual appearance, or being personally served with process, and any other person interested who was not a party to the proceedings by actual appearance, or being personally served with process, may, within three years after such final decision in the circuit court, by a bill in chancery, impeach the decision and have a retrial of the question of probate; and either party shall be entitled to a jury for the trial thereof. An infant, not a party, shall not be barred of such proceedings in chancery until twelve months after attaining full age.'\n'Sec. 6525. If any person interested in the probate of any will shall appear within five years after the probate or rejection thereof, and, by petition to the circuit court of the county in which such will was established or rejected, pray to have any such will rejected, if previously established, or proven, if previously rejected by the court of probate, it shall be the duty of the circuit court to direct an issue to try the validity of such will, which issue shall in all cases be tried by a jury.'\n\n As the functions of the probate and circuit courts in Arkansas were united in a single court in the Indian Territory, it seems plain, as was held by the supreme court of Oklahoma in this case, that the sections ( 6509 and 6521) dealing with appeals from the probate to the circuit court were not applicable to the conditions in the Indian Territory, and therefore were not adopted by the act of Congress. It hardly was intended that a court at all times presided over by a single judge should entertain appeals from its own decisions.\n The contention advanced respecting  6523 is that it related only to decisions of the circuit court upon appeals from the probate court, and was inapplicable where such an appeal could not be had, and therefore was not adopted. \n\n[241 U.S. 99, 102]\n\u00a0\n This point was not considered in the opinion of the supreme court of Oklahoma, and it need not be decided here. However it might be resolved, the result in the present case would be the same.\n The contention made respecting  6525 is that it was not adopted, because not in force in Arkansas at the close of the session of the general assembly of 1883. The claim that it was not then in force is based upon a decision of the supreme court of Arkansas in 1885, holding that it was impliedly repealed by the inclusion in the civil practice act of 1868, which was a later enactment, of certain provisions regulating appeals from the probate to the circuit court, and prescribing the effect to be given to the latter's decision upon such an appeal. Dowell v. Tucker, 46 Ark. 438. Of course, that decision was controlling in Arkansas, but it has little bearing upon the question here presented, and for these reasons: Section 6525 was published in 1884 in Mansfield's Digest as a general law 'in force at the close of the general assembly of 1883' (see title page of that publication), and the supreme court of the state had been treating it as such (Tobin v. Jenkins, 29 Ark. 151; Janes v. Williams, 31 Ark. 175, 189; Jenkins v. Tobin, 31 Ark. 306, 308; Mitchell v. Rogers, 40 Ark. 91, 93-95). Besides, the particular provisions of the civil practice act which ultimately were regarded as effecting its implied repeal in Arkansas-they became  6509 and 6521 of Mansfield's Digest-were not adopted by the act of Congress, because inapplicable to the conditions in the Indian Territory. In these circumstances we think the adopting act, rightly interpreted, put the section in force there. Separated, as it then was, from the restraining influence of the supposedly conflicting provisions of the civil practice act, it assumed its normal place among the other laws with which it was adopted. This conclusion is not opposed to our decisions in Adkins v. Arnold, \n235 U.S. 417\n, 59 L. ed. 294, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 118, and Perryman v. Woodward, \n238 U.S. 148\n, 59 L. ed. 1242, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 830, as \n\n[241 U.S. 99, 103]\n\u00a0\n seems to be claimed by the plaintiff in error, but, on the contrary, is in accord with what actually was there decided.\n Other questions are discussed in the briefs, but as they are not Federal, but essentially local, they cannot be re-examined by us.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGLASS v.

CO.(1916)\nNo. 60\nArgued: Decided: December 11, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 202, 203]\n\u00a0\n Messrs Fred L. Chappell and Otis A. Earl for petitioner.\n Mr. V. H. Lockwood for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Suit for infringement of a patent, brought by petitioner, whom we shall call complainant, against the respondents, whom we shall call defendants, in the circuit court for the district of Indiana, October 3, 1910\n\n\n The device of the controversy is a new and useful improvement in hoisting pulleys. It is alleged to have been invented by Hubert A. Myers, one of the defendants, who, after his application for a patent, but before the issue thereof, assigned all of his right and title to one Allen P. Boyer, to whom a patent was issued January 21, 1908. Boyer, on the 28th of September, 1910, sold and assigned his right and title to the patent to complainant, 'together with all rights and choses in action which had accrued to him, as well as those which might accrue for infringement thereof, and all rights to sue for and recover damages or profits for the same.'\n It is alleged that after the issue of the patent and before the commencement of the suit defendants infringed the \n\n[242 U.S. 202, 204]\n\u00a0\n invention by constructing and selling a large number of the pulleys, the exact number not known, and discovery is therefore prayed; and it is alleged that defendants have a large number on hand which they are offering for sale.\n It is further alleged that large profits have been realized by defendants which might have been obtained by complainant; how much exactly, however, is unknown, and discovery is prayed. An accounting is also prayed and preliminary and final injunctions.\n It is alleged that Myers took part in promoting and organizing the defendant corporation, that he is a large stockholder, and is actively engaged in directing and managing the affairs of the company, being its general manager.\n It is also alleged that the trade and public have recognized the value and validity of the patent.\n The defendants answered separately. Myers's answer is not in the record. The defendant company's is, and denies that the company had in any manner infringed the rights of the complainant under the patent, or that any great loss or injury had accrued or will accrue to complainant by reason of anything theretofore done by defendant, or that complainant had been or is being deprived of any gains or profits to which it is lawfully entitled, by reason of any act or any manufacture, use, or sale of hoisting devices by defendant.\n And defendant alleges that it has not manufactured any hoisting device of any kind since October, 1909, or sold or had for sale any hoisting device since March, 1910, and that complainant had knowledge of such facts before bringing this suit; and denies that it was receiving or enjoying great gains or profits, or had avowed its determination to continue manufacturing and selling any such devices.\n It admits that Myers took part in organizing the defendant corporation, but denies that he is a stockholder or \n\n[242 U.S. 202, 205]\n\u00a0\n in management of its affairs; alleges that he ceased to be a stockholder on November 19, 1909, and that he has not been a director or other officer since December 17th of that year, or connected with the company or interested therein.\n The answer denies the other allegations of the bill, including the novelty of the device, specifically alleging that it was not the result of invention, but merely of mechanical skill in bringing together parts of hoisting devices long previously well known and described and published in prior patents, a list of which is given, and that hoisting devices in all substantial and patentable respects similar to the alleged invention were known and publicly sold and used in the United States, the instances of which are related.\n Abandonment of the alleged invention by Myers is alleged, that complainant is estopped by reason of actions had in the patent office from claiming a device other than in the specific form shown and described in the patent, that Myers was not the first inventor or discoverer of a material and substantial part of the device of the patent, and that neither he nor the complainant has ever made or filed a disclaimer thereof, to the great injury of defendants.\n There was a replication filed to the answer.\n Upon the issues thus formed by the pleadings proofs were taken and a decree was entered that the suit be dismissed for want of equity. The decree gives no information upon which it was based.\n The complainant took the case to the circuit court of appeals and that court affirmed the decree. Stating the question presented, the court said: 'The first and decisive question raised in this appeal from a decree dismissing a bill in equity after a full hearing is whether a court of equity or a court of law is the proper forum in which to determine complainant's rights.' [131 C. C. A. 662, 215 Fed. 594.]\n It will be observed that defendant puts in issue the title of complainant, the novelty of the device described in the \n\n[242 U.S. 202, 206]\n\u00a0\n patent, alleges anticipation, and precludes or narrows it by the condition of the prior art. It denies infringement and also irreparable loss or injury to complainant by anything theretofore done by defendant, or that complainant was deprived or is being deprived of any great gains or profits to which it is lawfully entitled by reason of any act or any manufacture, use, or sale of hoisting devices by defendant.\n It appears from the facts found that Myers was the inventor of complainant's device and that he subsequently claimed to have invented another different from and superior to that of complainant, which he assigned to Boyer, and that the defendant company which Myers had helped to organize began to manufacture the device of the alleged second invention of Myers and made 25 in the spring of 1908, and the following fall prepared to make 500 more, 300 of which were sold and the rest not completed. In August, 1909, it (the defendant company) contracted to manufacture and sell to one Diedrich 500 additional carriers for the season of 1910. It was in testimony that the 300 carriers sold by defendant were sold through Diedrich as its agent.\n In October, 1909, complainant published a newspaper advertisement declaring defendant company to be an infringer of complainant's device, and also sent a direct notice to defendant to the same effect. In consequence of this it is testified that the defendant company was unable to proceed and it fulfilled its contract with Diedrich by giving him permission to use its shop and materials to finish the 200 uncompleted carriers and to manufacture the 300 more called for by his contract.\n In December, 1909, Myers sold his stock to the other stockholders and thereafter had no connection with the company, and it is testified that the company neither manufactured nor sold carriers after the notice of infringement, except as stated above, and that its president and general manager notified complainants in February, 1911, \n\n[242 U.S. 202, 207]\n\u00a0\n that the company was practically dead. In March, 1910, it is further testified, it sold its entire plant and all of its property except only the letters patent No. 942,735, that is, the patent for the second invention of Myers, since which time it has been out of business and without factory or office. It is also testified that in the latter part of 1909, after notice of infringement, it had decided not to manufacture any more carriers.\n From this testimony the circuit court of appeals deduced that clearly as to Myers, after December, 1909, and as to the defendant company, after March, 1910, at the latest, no infringement of complainant's rights had been committed or threatened.\n We are unable to concur in the conclusion as to the company. It sold its plant in March, 1910, but it retained the patent under which prior alleged infringements had been practised and justified, and the right to proceed under it is neither given up nor the intention to do so denied. Besides, in September, 1910, the company sued Boyer in the state court for the injury to its business by the advertisement of infringement published a year before, and in that suit the company made the following allegation: That it 'is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the state of Indiana and is now and has been for more than five years last past engaged in the business of manufacturing hay cars.' We cannot ascribe this to the inadvertence or improvidence of counsel, for which the company was not responsible, as an expression of its intention. It had infringed (we assume this for the sake of argument only); it retained the patent under which it asserted the right to infringe; there was injury inflicted, therefore, and the means retained of further infringement; a denial of complainant's right, and the assertion of a countervailing right submitted for legal judgment in the case under review and besides in an independent action. We must regard this conduct as a continuing menace, and we think \n\n[242 U.S. 202, 208]\n\u00a0\n complainant had a right to arrest its execution and recover as well the profits of which it had been deprived, if any. The case, therefore, does not fall within the rules of the cases cited by the circuit court of appeals and those cited by defendants. In other words, further infringement was in effect threatened and could be reasonably apprehended.\n We have assumed that there was infringing done and threatened, and, of course, both assumptions are based on the validity and novelty of the device and that the defendant company's device-that is, the device of patent No. 942,735-is an unsubstantial variation of it. Whether the assumption is justified is yet to be decided, and, in the first instance, should be decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Its decree dismissing the case is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","73":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT NORTHERN R. CO. v. CAPITAL TRUST CO.(1916)\nNo. 107\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 144, 145]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. L. Janes and M. L. Countryman for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Samuel A. Anderson for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n While employed by the railway company as a switchman, William M. Ward was accidentally killed, December 13, 1912; and the administrator brought suit in a state court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, as amended, for the benefit of his father and mother, seeking to recover their pecuniary loss and also damages for the injuries suffered by him prior to death. Some evidence tended to show that, after being run over by one or more cars, although wholly unconscious, the deceased continued to breathe for perhaps ten minutes. Testimony of other witnesses supported a claim that there was no appreciable continuation of life. Judgment upon an unapportioned verdict, in favor of the administrator, was affirmed by the state supreme court, October, 1914. The railway company duly excepted to the following portions of the charge:\n'Did Ward's injuries kill him instantly? If he was killed instantly, one rule of damages applies, while if he lived some time after he was injured, another rule of damages would apply. There is some evidence that he lived a few minutes after receiving his injuries; there is other evidence that he was dead when taken out from \n\n[242 U.S. 144, 146]\n\u00a0\n under the car. If you should find that Ward died from his injuries without living an appreciable length of time, then the plaintiff could only recover, if at all, what would have been the pecuniary value of Ward's life to his father and mother had he lived. . . . And in that connection it would be proper for you to consider his health, his disposition to contribute to the support of his parents, the evidence of what he customarily earned, his earning capacity, the amount he was in the habit of giving to his parents, his age, his condition in life, the length of time he probably would have lived had not this accident happened, and the expectancy of the life of the father and mother, and the reasonable expectancy of the parents in respect to benefits, if any, from the services of their son; . . .\n\n'In case you find that Ward did not die instantly from his injuries, but that he lived some appreciable length of time after the accident, then you would come to another question in the case.\n\n'Under the law of the United States it is provided that any right of action given by the act of Congress in reference to injuries of this kind under such circumstances, that the right of action shall survive to the personal representatives of the deceased for the benefit of his parents, if there is no surviving widow and children. And if you should find from the evidence that Ward did not die instantly from his injuries, but that he lived some little time after he was injured, then, under the law, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover damages in the same amount that Ward, the deceased, would have been entitled to recover had he brought the action in his lifetime. That is, you can award such damages as, in your judgment, would be a full, fair, and reasonable compensation for the loss sustained by Ward, the deceased, by reason of the injuries he received . . . . And in that connection, it would be proper for you to consider his age, his habits \n\n[242 U.S. 144, 147]\n\u00a0\n of industry, his health, his ability to work, his earning capacity, and the amount he usually earned at the time he was injured, and the length of time he would probably have lived had he not been injured, using your best judgment under all the circumstances in arriving at what would be a fair compensation for his loss.'\n\n In St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Craft, \n237 \nU.S. 648, 655\n, 658 S., 59 L. ed. 1160, 1162, 1163, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 704, 9 N. C. C. A. 754 (June 1, 1915) we held that, under the Employers' Liability Act, as amended in 1910, 36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8662, the administrator of a fatally injured employee might recover the beneficiary's pecuniary loss and also for pain and suffering endured by deceased between the moment of injury and final dissolution. We were careful, however, to say-( 655) 'But to avoid any misapprehension it is well to observe that the case is close to the border line, for such pain and suffering as are substantially contemporaneous with death or mere incidents to it, as also the short periods of insensibility which sometimes intervene between fatal injuries and death, afford no basis for a separate estimation or award of damages under statutes like that which is controlling here.' And, referring to the two separate grounds of recovery-(658) 'Although originating in the same wrongful act or neglect, the two claims are quite distinct, no part of either being embraced in the other. One is for the wrong to the injured person, and is confined to his personal loss and suffering before he died, while the other is for the wrong to the beneficiaries, and is confined to their pecuniary loss through his death. One begins where the other ends, and a recovery upon both in the same action is not a double recovery for a single wrong, but a single recovery for a double wrong.'\n The present record presents the very circumstances which we declared afforded no basis for an estimation or award of damages in addition to the beneficiary's pecuniary loss. And although apparently not challenged in the state supreme court, and therefore not now to be \n\n[242 U.S. 144, 148]\n\u00a0\n relied on as ground for reversal (Harding v.

Lindley for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Tom Davis, Ernest A. Michel, and John I. Davis for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought under the Federal employers' liability act. The plaintiff (defendant in error) was the station agent at Dassel, Minnesota. It was a part of his duty to attend the pump house some distance from the station, once or twice a day, and keep filled the water tank for locomotives. The water was pumped by means of a gasolene engine, and the pump and engine were in a small room. In proceeding to start the pump at the time in question, the plaintiff's arm was caught in the clutch of the engine and cut off. As the supreme court of the state put it, the plaintiff claimed that 'he lost his balance, either through a slip upon the greasy floor or a jerk by his coat being drawn into the fly wheel or shaft, and in striking out to catch himself his hand and part of the arm came between the crank of the shaft and top of the hood which partially but inadequately guarded it.' The state court deemed the evidence to be 'very clear' that it was practicable to interpose safeguards 'so as to fully protect from danger those who had to pass by.' The plaintiff alleged negligence in his employer, in failing to provide suitable \n\n[240 U.S. 464, 466]\n\u00a0\n protection; the company denied negligence and insisted upon the defense of assumption of risk. The trial court held that upon the evidence these questions were for the jury, and there was a verdict for the plaintiff. On motion, a new trial was ordered unless the plaintiff should remit a portion of the damages, and, this being done, judgment was entered, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 130 Minn. 405, 153 N. W. 848.\n It was conceded that when the injury was received, plaintiff was engaged in work pertaining to the defendant's business as a common carrier in interstate commerce, and that the Federal act applied. The court recognized that, if assumption of risk by the plaintiff was made out, it would bar recovery under the act. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, \n233 U.S. 492\n, 58 L. ed. 1062, L.R.A.1915C, 1, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635, 8 N. C. C. A. 834, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475. The court charged the jury accordingly, and there was no exception by the defendant to the charge, or request on its part for any additional instructions,-the defendant contenting itself with its motion for dismissal or for a direction of a verdict in its favor. The case, then, is one in which there is no question as to the interpretation of any provision of the Federal act, or as to the definition of legal principle in its application, but simply involves an appreciation of all the facts and admissible inferences in the particular case for the purpose of determining whether there were matters for the consideration of the jury. The state courts, trial and appellate, held that there were. Having regard to the appropriate exercise of the jurisdiction of this court, we should not disturb the decision upon a question of this sort unless error is palpable.

WILES(1916)\nNo. 196\nArgued: Decided: March 20, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 444, 445]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. C. Lindley and M. L. Countryman for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. W. R. Duxbury and Lyle Pettijohn for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action for damages for the killing of one Dennis E. Wiles, brought by the administrator of his estate, who is also his father and next of kin. It was brought under the employers' liability act of April 22, 1908 (35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149), as amended April 5, 1910 (36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8662).\n Wiles was a freight brakeman in the employ of the railway company in interstate commerce, the company being an interstate common carrier.\n There was a verdict for plaintiff in the sum of $650. Upon motion of defendant the court, expressing the view that Wiles's negligence was the proximate cause of the accident which resulted in his death, rendered judgment that, notwithstanding the verdict, plaintiff take nothing by his action, that the same be dismissed, and that the railway company recover of plaintiff $36.52 costs.\n The judgment was reversed by the supreme court of the state and judgment ordered to be entered on the verdict.\n The only issue is as to the negligence of the railway company and the contributory negligence of the deceased, and the causal relation, if either existed, to the death of the deceased.\n The determining facts of the case are as follows:\n Deceased was a rear brakeman on a freight train of the railway company proceeding easterly between Grotto and \n\n[240 U.S. 444, 446]\n\u00a0\n Skykomish, Washington. After having passed a curve in the road the train broke in two by the drawbar pulling out of the sixth car from the engine, which caused the train to stop instantly. It was run into shortly after ( from 3 to 5 minutes, it was testified) by a passenger train drawn by two engines. The night was pretty dark and the weather a little misty. At the place of collision the track was obstructed by a very sharp curve and a bluff on the right-hand side for about five box-car lengths, and the rear end of the freight train at that place could not be seen more than five box-car lengths away. On the left-hand side of the engine, which is the fireman's side, the track could not be seen more than a car length ahead because that would be on the outside of the curve. The engineer of the passenger train did not know of the existence of the freight train ahead and no negligence is attributed to him. The deceased and the conductor of the freight train were in the caboose and both were killed. What caused the pulling out of the drawbar was not shown, nor was there proof that it was defective, or that the company was negligent in the care or use of it.\n The head brakeman of the freight train testified that the train stopped immediately upon the pulling out of the drawbar, that he descended from the train and hastened back to the caboose for a chain, and that he saw the headlight of the passenger train as it came around the curve. He further testified that it was Wiles's duty to have gone back to protect the rear end of his train at the time the passenger train was due out of the station in the rear, and that this applied whether the delayed inferior train which was ahead was running or standing still; that it was the duty of Wiles to have gone back a sufficient distance to guarantee full protection to the rear of his train, and that the engineer of the freight train, at the time the train broke in two, signaled the rear brakeman to go back and protect the rear end of his train. The same testimony as \n\n[240 U.S. 444, 447]\n\u00a0\n to the duty of Wiles was given by another witness. It appeared also from the testimony that the freight train was losing time by slipping, and that Wiles knew the time that the passenger train was due to leave Grotto station, and he should have dropped off or dropped fuses on the track to notify the engineer of the passenger train that the freight was running slow. The fuses are of red and yellow lights; the red means to stop for ten minutes, the yellow means to bring the train under control and keep it under control until the next station is reached.\n The rules of the railway company were put in evidence as follows:\n'Rule 99. When a train stops or is delayed by any circumstance under which it may be overtaken by another train, the flagman must go back immediately with stop signals a sufficient distance to insure full protection. When recalled he may return to his train, first placing two torpedoes on the rail six rail lengths apart, or a lighted fusee in the center of the track when conditions require.'\n\n'Rule 100. If the train should part while in motion trainmen must, if possible, prevent damage to the detached portions. The signals prescribed by 13D and 15F must be given.'\n\n 13D is the lantern signal or hand signal, either one; 15F is the whistle signal. Rule 100 applied to what should be done by the members of the train crew for the protection of the separated portions of the train itself. Rule 99 applied to what whould be done for the protection of other trains approaching.\n The supreme court applied the rule of res ipsa loquitur and justified a submission to the jury of the negligence of the railway company as a deduction from the pulling out of the drawbar, and the proportion of its causal relation to the death of Wiles to the amount of negligence attributable to him, and reversed the action of the trial court, entering judgment for the company notwithstanding the verdict. \n\n[240 U.S. 444, 448]\n\u00a0\n The application of the doctrine to cases like that at bar is disputable. Patton v. Texas & P. R. Co. \n179 U.S. 658\n, 45 L. ed. 361, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 275; Looney v. Metropolitan R. Co. \n200 \nU.S. 480, 486\n, 50 S. L. ed. 564, 568, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 303, 19 Am. Neg. Rep. 627. We, however, do not have to go farther than to indicate the dispute. The case at bar is not solved by the doctrine. There is no justification for a comparison of negligences or the apportioning of their effect. The pulling out of the drawbar produced a condition which demanded an instant performance of duty by Wiles,-a duty not only to himself, but to others. The rules of the company were devised for such condition and provided for its emergency. Wiles knew them, and he was prompted to the performance of the duty they enjoined (the circumstances would seem to have needed no prompting) by signals from the engineer when the train stopped. He disregarded both. His fate gives pause to blame, but we cannot help pointing out that the tragedy of the collision might have been appalling. He brought death to himself and to the conductor of his train. His neglect might have extended the catastrophe to the destruction of passengers in the colliding train. How imperative his duty was is manifest. To excuse its neglect in any way would cast immeasurable liability upon the railroads, and, what is of greater concern, remove security from the lives of those who travel upon them; and therefore all who are concerned with their operation, however high or low in function, should have a full and an anxious sense of responsibility.\n In the present case there was nothing to extenuate Wiles's negligence; there was nothing to confuse his judgment or cause hesitation. His duty was as clear as its performance was easy. He knew the danger of the situation and that it was imminent; to avert it he had only to descend from his train, run back a short distance, and give the signals that the rules directed.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGUERINI STONE CO. v. P. J. CARLIN CONST. CO.(1916)\nNo. 78\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 264, 265]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward S. Paine for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Francis H. Dexter for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n We have here under review a judgment for damages in favor of plaintiff in error against defendant in error, reversal being asked upon the ground that, through erroneous rulings made by the trial judge, the recovery was unduly limited. The writ of error was sued out under  244, Jud. Code (act of March 3, 1911, chap. 231, 36 Stat. at L. 1087, 1157, Comp. Stat. 1913,  968, 1221), prior to the act of January 28, 1915 (38 Stat. at L. 804, chap. 22,  3 and 6)\n Defendant, a corporation of the state of New York, on December 12, 1910, secured a contract with the government of the United States for the construction of a postoffice and court building at San Juan, Porto Rico. A few days later it entered into a subcontract in writing with one Guerini, by the first paragraph of which he agreed: 'To furnish and set in position, including the concrete backing, all the imitation of sandstone, and to construct the interior concrete walls, concrete floors, concrete roof, backing the granite construction, enclosing all the I beams . . . agreeable to the drawings and specifications made by the said architect ( copies of which have been delivered to the subcontractor), and to the dimensions and explanations thereon, therein and herein \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 266]\n\u00a0\n contained, according to the true intent and meaning of said drawings and specifications,' etc.; it being agreed that the work should be done 'under the direction and to the satisfaction of the general contractors and James Knox Taylor, architect (acting as agents of the owner) or his or its representative.'\n A subsequent paragraph reads as follows:\n'25th. The subcontractor further agrees to furnish the material and build the concrete footing complete to the basement floor for the sum of $ 6.70 a cubic foot.\n\n'Also to furnish the materials and build all the sidewalks for the sum of $1.85 a square yard.\n\n'Also set in position all the granite walls, steps, balusters, buttresses, and curbing, and all other granite work for the sum of 40 cents a square foot surface. The three above items to be at the option of the general contractor. . . .'\n\n Thereafter the plaintiff corporation was formed under the laws of Massachusetts, and Guerini transferred the contract to it. Defendant was notified of this, expressed satisfaction in writing under date February 20, 1911, and thereafter dealt with plaintiff as subcontractor.\n At a later time, defendant exercised the third only of the options given to it by the 25th paragraph.\n The plan of the building contemplated a foundation of concrete and piles, which was to be constructed by defendant complete to the basement floor; above this a basement story, surfaced with granite blocks to be furnished by defendant (as a practical matter, to be sent from the United States) and to be set in position by plaintiff under the accepted option. The blocks were to be backed with concrete, to be furnished and set by plaintiff. Above the basement story, the exterior walls were to be faced with imitation sandstone, backed with concrete, which, together with interior walls, floors, and roof of concrete, were to be constructed by plaintiff. \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 267]\n\u00a0\n The contract contained the following clauses that bear upon the matters in dispute:\n'6th. The subcontractor shall and will proceed with the said work and every part and detail thereof in a prompt and diligent manner, . . . and shall and will wholly finish the said work according to the said drawings and specifications and this contract in 300 days from the date upon which the building is ready to receive his work and after he has been notified to proceed by general contractors, and in default thereof, the subcontractor shall pay the general contractors the sum of $20 for every day thereafter that the said work shall remain unfinished as and for liquidated damages. The subcontractor further agrees to begin work at the building within three days from the time that he is notified by the general contractors that the building is ready to receive such work.\n\n'7th. . . . Should the subcontractor be obstructed or delayed in the prosecution or completion of the work by neglect, delay, or default of the owner, the architect, the general contractors, or of any other contractors employed by them upon the work, or by alterations which may be required in said work, or by any damage which might happen by fire, lightning, earthquake, or cyclone, or by the abandonment of the work by the employees through no fault of the subcontractor, then the time herein fixed for the completion of the work shall be extended for a period equivalent to the time lost by reason of any or all of the causes aforesaid,' etc.\n\n'11th. The general contractors will provide all labor and materials not included in this contract in such manner as not to delay the material progress of the work, and in the event of failure so to do, thereby causing loss to the subcontractor, agree that they will reimburse the subcontractor for such loss; and the subcontractor agrees that if he shall delay the material progress of the work so \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 268]\n\u00a0\n as to cause any damage for which the general contractors shall become liable, then he shall make good to the general contractors any such damage over and above any damage for general delay, herein otherwise provided; the amount of such loss or damage in either case, to be fixed and determined by the architect, or by arbitration, as provided in article 3d in this contract.\n\n'12th. It is hereby mutually agreed by the parties hereto that the sum to be paid by the general contractors to the subcontractor for said work and materials shall be sixty-four thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars ($64,750), subject to additions or deductions as hereinbefore provided, and that such sum shall be paid in current funds by the general contractors to the subcontractor in monthly payments on account, not to exceed in amount 85 per cent of the cost of the work actually erected in the building, provided that the subcontractor furnishes to the general contractors a written requisition, on a form to be supplied by the general contractors, not less than twelve days before payment is required, . . .'\n\n The action was commenced in June, 1912. The complaint, besides the jurisdictional averments, alleged the making of the contract between Guerini and defendant, the assignment to plaintiff, and defendant's consent and recognition of plaintiff as the contracting party; averred that thereafter and during the month of February, 1911, at defendant's request and in pursuance of the terms of the contract, plaintiff employed and sent to Porto Rico its representatives, brought laborers from the United States and employed others in Porto Rico, organized its working forces, purchased and supplied the necessary tools and materials, and prepared itself and was ready and willing to perform its obligations under the contract, but that thereafter until the 16th day of October, 1911, plaintiff was not permitted by defendant to proceed with the work, owing to defendant's failure to provide the necessary \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 269]\n\u00a0\n granite blocks; that on that day plaintiff did proceed with all possible diligence and performed all the work provided for by the contract as fast as defendant, in the course of construction work, permitted plaintiff to do so; that nevertheless during the period from October 16, 1911, until March 9, 1912, the work was unreasonably and unjustifiably delayed by the failure of defendant to provide necessary materials and carry on its part of the construction work so as to permit plaintiff to perform the work required of it under the contract, and that plaintiff was thereby greatly damaged; that on March 9, 1912, all work of every nature was stopped on the building, and plaintiff was prevented by defendant from continuing with any work; that said stoppage 'has continued ever since, is still continuing, and . . . will continue for a period of at least several months hereafter,' and that defendant has accordingly committed a breach of its obligations under the contract, the result of which has been and is to cause great damage and loss to plaintiff, which has been obliged to keep its labor force on hand during all of said period at great loss and expense; that by the terms of the contract payment of not more than 85 per cent of the amount of the work actually done was due and payable by defendant monthly on twelve days' notice from plaintiff to defendant, and that plaintiff during the months of December, 1911, and January and February, 1912, duly notified and demanded of defendant payment of the sums due for the work actually performed, but that defendant continuously and repeatedly failed and refused to make said payments; that because of said repeated violation and breach of the contract on the part of defendant, plaintiff, under date of May 22, 1912, notified defendant in writing of its election to terminate the contract and bring its action for damages for breach thereof; and that plaintiff has offered to defendant to arbitrate their differences, but that defendant has refused. Plaintiff claimed damages to the amount of \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 270]\n\u00a0\n $45,797.45 for work and labor performed, materials furnished, and moneys expended in and about the performance of the contract, and for lost profits. In a separate paragraph an indebtedness of about $40,000 was alleged, for the reasonable value of work, labor, and materials supplied.\n Defendant answered, admitting some of the averments of the complaint, but denying that plaintiff had complied with the terms of the contract or had been prevented by defendant from proceeding with and carrying on its work; admitting that plaintiff notified defendant of its election to cancel or rescind the contract and bring its action for damages for the alleged breach thereof, but denying that there was cause for rescission, and denying that plaintiff had sustained damages as claimed by it. The answer further set up that the subcontract was subject to all the terms and conditions of the principal contract made between defendant and the government of the United States; that defendant had at all times proceeded strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions of the latter contract, that during the course of the construction of the building the representatives of the government found it desirable or necessary to change the manner of constructing the foundations, and that this action of the government was within its rights under the original contract, and plaintiff was bound thereby equally with defendant.\n The case was tried before the judge of the district court and a jury. Plaintiff introduced evidence tending to support the material averments of its complaint. It appeared that in January, 1911, defendant notified plaintiff's predecessor that 'work must start at once,' and that in February plaintiff sent its representatives to Porto Rico; that upon their arrival so little work had been done upon the foundations that they were unable to do anything upon the building itself, but preliminary work was done in the way of getting tools and machinery to the Island, building \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 271]\n\u00a0\n workshops and an office, and preparing moulds for the casting of the artificial stone; that during the spring and summer delay was occasioned by the failure of defendant to construct the foundations; that this continued until about the first week in October, when the foundation work and the grading inside the foundation walls had proceeded to a point that would admit of the commencement of the course of granite, and enough granite was upon the ground to allow a start to be made of setting it. In August or September plaintiff was notified of defendant's acceptance of the option to call upon plaintiff to set the granite at 40 cents per square foot, but the granite was slow in arriving, and some of the stones were misfits, so that the work of laying was considerably interrupted. There was difficulty also with the derrick equipment, defendant having, under the contract, furnished two derricks and an engine, but with insufficient power to admit of operating both derricks at the same time. This was remedied, some time in December, by the provision of additional power. The granite setting proceeded from the middle of October to the 12th of February, 1912, plaintiff's evidence being to the effect that it was set as fast as delivered, but that because the granite came in separate shipments, a little at a time, sometimes with needed blocks missing, the work of setting it could not be speeded. On or about February 12, 1912, plaintiff stopped setting granite, with defendant's consent.\n The evidence tended to show that much of the delay during the spring and summer of 1911 was occasioned by a change made by arrangement between defendant and the government in the provisions of the general contract respecting the mode of constructing the foundations. The pleader would seem to have limited the complaint respecting delay prior to October 16, 1911, to such as was due to defendant's failure to provide granite blocks, but the evidence was not thus limited.\n In February, 1912, when the granite work had been \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 272]\n\u00a0\n practically finished, it was ascertained that the foundations had settled, and that there were variations in the foundation work from the specifications as agreed upon between the government and defendant. On March 9th work was suspended by order of the government, pending an investigation which resulted in showing that practically the entire building would have to be underpinned in order to secure a safe foundation. This result was officially communicated to defendant under date March 25, 1912, and a few days later, pursuant to an order of the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, all work upon the building was stopped 'pending the settlement of responsibility for deviations from contract requirements regarding foundations.' The question of responsibility lay between defendant and the representatives of the government; plaintiff having had nothing to do with the foundations. Leaving the question undetermined, the government, in the month of May, 1912, entered into an agreement with defendant for underpinning the entire building. It perhaps does not clearly appear when this work was commenced, but it was in progress when the action was begun, and Mr. Berrymen, the government's superintendent of construction then in charge of the building, testified: 'This work is now [ November, 1912] about 85 per cent completed.' The same witness testified that from March 9th, 1912, until the time of the trial, 'conditions were such that it was impossible for the Guerini Stone Company to continue with their work under the contract.'\n On March 9, 1912, plaintiff's agent at San Juan was notified by defendant's representative there that the Federal authorities had ordered all work upon the building suspended pending investigation of the foundations. On the same day he wrote defendant's San Juan office asking whether plaintiff's men should be discharged and sent back to the United States, but got no satisfactory reply. Further correspondence upon the same topic led to no result. \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 273]\n\u00a0\n Meanwhile, the parties had been in disagreement about payments on account. The contract ( 12) provided for payment of the contract price 'in monthly payments on account, not to exceed in amount 85 per cent of the cost of the work actually erected in the building, provided that the subcontractor furnishes to the general contractors a written requisition, on a form to be supplied by the general contractors, not less than twelve days before payment is required,' etc. The contract, however, did not provide how the cost of the work other than the granite setting should be ascertained. For the concrete backing and other concrete work and the imitation sand-stone covered by the subcontract, no 'unit prices' were specified. The price of '6.70 a cubic foot,' mentioned in the 25th paragraph as the optional price for concrete footings, was treated by the parties as if intended to read $6.70 per cubic yard,-approximately 25 cents per cubic foot. This, however, had reference to work that plaintiff was not called upon to do, and obviously did not furnish a unit price for the concreting actually done by plaintiff.\n In December, 1911, and January, 1912, plaintiff made written requisitions for payments on account, based upon statements of the 'amount of work completed to date.' They were not complied with, and the parties soon realized the practical importance of agreeing upon a unit price to be employed in estimating the amounts payable. According to the testimony of Mr. Converse, President and Treasurer of the Guerini Company, he went from Boston to New York city on February 2, 1912, by appointment, and conferred with Mr. Carlin, defendant's representative, upon the subject of unit prices, and it was then agreed that plaintiff should make its applications and receive its payments upon the basis of a certain written schedule of units, produced by Mr. Carlin, which specified (inter alia): 'Exterior and interior concrete walls, arches, and cement \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 274]\n\u00a0\n work, $1.07 per cu. ft; concrete floors and casings, 45 1\/2c. per sq. ft.' Mr. Carlin, in his testimony, denied that such an agreement was made, but admitted that the schedule had been agreed upon between defendant and the government's superintendent of construction, and used as a basis for payments by the government to defendant, including payments for the work done by plaintiff under the subcontract. At the interview of February 2d, Mr. Converse received a check for $3,765.50 on account, as against $12,750 previously called for. Under date of March 9th a requisition for $11,735. 95 was made, and against this a payment of $674 was made about two weeks thereafter. No other payments were made to plaintiff. It appeared, however, that for the work theretofore done by plaintiff, defendant had received from the government at least $13,871.25 (a witness called by defendant said 'about $19,000'), based upon the price of $1.07 per cubic foot for concrete. It was explained that this unit price was fixed by the first superintendent of construction, who had charge during the year 1911 and the first month of the following year, and that his successor, who took charge on February 1, 1912, employed a lower unit price, on the basis of which the Carlin Company had been overpaid about $8,000.\n Enough has been said to indicate the situation as it stood on May 22, 1912, on which date plaintiff wrote to defendant, reciting briefly its complaints respecting defendant's previous conduct and the stoppage of the work, and concluding as follows:\n'Under these circumstances and owing to your entire failure to comply with the terms of the contract, we hereby notify you that we now terminate the contract and shall proceed no further with the work, and that we shall hold you liable for damages we have sustained by reason of your breach of contract, including your failure to provide labor and materials not included in the contract with \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 275]\n\u00a0\n us in such manner as not to delay the material progress of our work and your failure to make payments in accordance with the terms of the contract, and all other breaches of contract on your part.'\n\n Defendant acknowledged receipt and replied May 31, 1912: 'Said letter is a breach of contract on your part, and we shall immediately proceed to have the work done by other parties, and shall charge you with the additional expense, if any, above your contract price.'\n Plaintiff further produced evidence tending to show that the moneys expended by it in and about the performance of the contract amounted to upwards of $30,000; that if permitted to complete the contract under ordinary conditions, its estimated profits would have been about $9,700; and that defendant had taken over machinery, tools, etc., belonging to plaintiff, estimated to be worth from $3,300 to $3,800.\n Defendant to some extent disputed the facts recounted in and inferable from plaintiff's evidence, but based its defense principally upon the provisions of the contract between defendant and the government, which it was insisted must be read into the contract between plaintiff and defendant. Among those provisions was this:\n'It is further covenanted and agreed that the United States shall have the right of suspending the whole or any part of the work herein contracted to be done, whenever, in the opinion of the supervising architect, it may be necessary for the purposes or advantage of the work, and upon such occasion or occasions the contractor shall, without expense to the United States, properly cover over, secure, and protect such of the work as may be liable to sustain injury from the weather, or otherwise; and for all such suspensions the contractor shall be allowed one day additional to the time herein stated for each and every day of such delay so caused in the completion of the work, the same to be ascertained by the \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 276]\n\u00a0\n supervising architect; and a similar allowance of extra time will be made for such other delays as the supervising architect may find to have been caused by the United States, provided that a written claim therefor is presented by the contractor within ten days of the occurrence of such delays; provided, further, that no claim shall be made or allowed to the contractor for any damages which may arise out of any delay caused by the United States.'\n\n And among the 'General Conditions' prefacing the specifications was this:\n'The Department, acting for the United States, reserves the right to suspend any portion of the work embraced in the contract whenever, in its opinion, it would be inexpedient to carry on said work.'\n\n Other contentions were made which are not now material.\n The jury rendered a verdict somewhat special in form, finding for the plaintiff and assessing its damages at $6,609.25, 'including the value of tools inventoried at $3,000.' The judge had instructed them that for certain material and appliances used by plaintiff in carrying out its contract, and which were placed in the custody and charge of defendant, 'credit must be given, in whatever decision you arrive at, to the plaintiff company, and in the uncontradicted sum of $3,000.' Just how the residue of the verdict was made up we have no means of determining, nor is it now important.\n The chief controversy here is over the admission in evidence of the general contract, and the effect given to it in the rulings of the trial judge, which were in substance that the provisions of that contract, including those above quoted, were to be read into the subcontract, and that for any delays which resulted from the action of the representatives of the government in changing the foundations or plans of the building, in suspending or stopping the work, or otherwise, defendant was not \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 277]\n\u00a0\n responsible to plaintiff. To these rulings exceptions were duly taken.\n From what was said by the trial judge it would seem that he labored under the impression that the supervising architect of the treasury was a party to the subcontract. This is not the case; he did not sign the agreement, and his name was inserted solely in the capacity of architect or referee. And although the subcontract very plainly imports that it covers only a part of the work of constructing the building, and that the Carlin Company was the general contractor, it contains no clause incorporating into itself the provisions of the principal contract, or even in terms referring to that instrument. The subcontractor's work was agreed to be done according to drawings and specifications, 'copies of which have been delivered to the subcontractor.' These copies were not produced, nor was their nonproduction accounted for. The parties seem to have assumed that the drawings and specifications of which copies were to have been delivered with the subcontract were identical with those that formed a part of the general contract; and we adopt that assumption.\n The reference in the subcontract to the drawings and specifications was evidently for the mere purpose of indicating what work was to be done, and in what manner done, by the subcontractor. Notwithstanding occasional expressions of a different view (see Shaw v. First Baptist Church, 44 Minn. 22, 24, 46 N. W. 146; Avery v. Ionia County, 71 Mich. 538, 546, 547, 39 N. W. 742; Stein v. McCarthy, 120 Wis. 288, 295, 97 N. W. 912), in our opinion the true rule, based upon sound reason and supported by the greater weight of authority, is that in the case of subcontracts, as in other cases of express agreements in writing, a reference by the contracting parties to an extraneous writing for a particular purpose makes it a part of their agreement only for the purpose specified. Woodruff v. Hough, 91 U. S. \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 278]\n\u00a0\n 596, 602, 23 L. ed. 332, 335; Neuval v. Cowell, 36 Cal. 648, 650; Mannix v. Tryon, 152 Cal. 31, 39, 91 Pac. 983; Moreing v. Weber, 3 Cal. App. 14, 20, 84 Pac. 220; Short v. Van Dyke, 50 Minn. 286, 289, 52 N. W. 643; Noyes v. Butler Bros. 98 Minn. 448, 450, 108 N. W. 839; Modern Steel Structural Co. v. English Constr. Co. 129 Wis. 31, 40, 41, 108 N. W. 70.\n In the present case, not only was the reference to the drawings and specifications for a limited purpose, but the subcontract, by the express terms of its 11th paragraph, placed upon the general contractor (defendant) the obligation to 'provide all labor and materials not included in this contract in such manner as not to delay the material progress of the work.' Applying this to the facts of the case, defendant agreed to furnish the foundation in such manner that plaintiff might build upon it without delay. This is inconsistent with any implication that the parties intended that delays attributable to the action of the owner should leave plaintiff remediless.\n We therefore hold that the general contract was not admissible in evidence against plaintiff, unless for the purpose of showing (if, indeed, it did show) what drawings and specifications were referred to in the subcontract; and that the rulings of the trial judge holding plaintiff bound by the provisions of the general contract, so as to be obliged to submit to delays resulting from the action of the government, were erroneous.\n Another point that may conveniently be dealt with here is raised by an exception taken to the instruction that 'even if there was delay in furnishing granite, there could have been no liability under the subcontract for such delay, in money, but such a condition was to be remedied by an extension of time for completion, as therein provided.' This was clearly erroneous. Paragraph 11 binds defendant to reimburse plaintiff for any loss caused by delay resulting from defendant's failure to provide materials not included in the subcontract. The \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 279]\n\u00a0\n granite was in this category. The trial court misapplied 7. The extension of time therein provided for was intended as a dispensation, under given circumstances, of the liability to liquidated damages imposed upon the subcontractor by 6 for failure to complete his work within the time therein limited. The purpose of 7 is to relieve the subcontractor. It cannot properly be construed to deprive him of his right under 11 to reimbursement for losses attributable to delays assumed by the general contractor. Nelson v. Pickwick Associated Co. 30 Ill. App. 333.\n What has been said indicates the disposition that must be made of another exception taken by plaintiff, which was to the instruction that under 7 plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages or money compensation from defendant even though it should appear that plaintiff 'was obstructed or delayed in the prosecution or completion of the work by the neglect, delay, or default of the government of the United States, the supervising architect, or his representatives, or by defendant, or by alterations required in the work, since by the provisions of that paragraph the only remedy of plaintiff in such case is the time allowance therein provided for; unless, however, you should believe from the evidence that the defendant failed to provide labor and materials not included in the subcontract, in such manner as to delay the material progress of the work.'\n As we have shown, the failure to furnish a foundation upon which plaintiff's work could be superimposed was a failure to provide 'labor and materials not included in this contract,' within the meaning of 11. To furnish the foundation defendant assumed an obligation not conditioned by the question whether it was at fault, or whether the delay was involuntary on its part because attributable to a stoppage of work by the owner, in the exercise of a right conferred upon it by the principal contract. \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 280]\n\u00a0\n Defendant, of course, had notice of the government's right to suspend the work, and could easily have safeguarded itself against responsibility to the subcontractor for delays attributable to the exercise of that right by an appropriate modification of 11 of the subcontract, for which presumably an allowance would have been made to the subcontractor in the form of an increased price for its work or otherwise. This not having been done, 11 must be enforced as it is written. It matters not whether plaintiff or its predecessor had notice of the provision of the general contract respecting suspension of the work, since that provision was not incorporated into the subcontract. It must be presumed that delays attributable to action by the government were among those intended to be safeguarded by 11.\n There was testimony as to the profits that plaintiff probably would have gained if the contract had been proceeded with in the ordinary manner. But this question was excluded from the consideration of the jury upon the ground that the profits were contingent and speculative. In this there was error. The testimony was from an experienced witness, and included an estimate of the total cost to plaintiff of the doing of the work called for in the subcontract. This amounted to $53,012. The contract price was $ 64,750. The witness testified that a profit of $9,700 would have been made. Whether he intended to say $11,700 was for the jury to determine. No more definite or certain method of estimating the profits could well be adopted than to deduct from the contract price the probable cost of furnishing the materials and doing the work. Philadelphia, W. & B. R. Co. v. Howard, 13 How. 307, 344, 14 L. ed. 157, 173; Hinckley v. Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Co. \n121 \nU.S. 264, 275\n, 30 S. L. ed. 967, 970, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 875; Anvil Min. Co. v. Humble, \n153 \nU.S. 540, 549\n, 38 S. L. ed. 814, 817, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 876.\n Error is assigned to the refusal of the trial judge to give the following instruction: \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 281]\n\u00a0\n 'If you find that the defendant failed to make payments as called for by the contract, on account of work done by the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of the contract, such failure constitutes a breach of the contract on the part of the defendant, and justified the plaintiff in stopping work under the contract, and entitled it to recovery from the defendant of such damages as may be proper on the evidence and under the instructions which the court will give you in that regard.'\n The request was evidently based upon the doctrine illustrated in South Fork Canal Co. v. Gordon, 6 Wall. 561, 18 L. ed. 894; Phillips & C. Constr. Co. v. Seymour, \n91 \nU.S. 646, 649\n, 23 S. L. ed. 341, 342; Norrington v. Wright, \n115 \nU.S. 188, 205\n, 29 S. L. ed. 366, 369, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 12. There is a difficulty, however, in applying that doctrine to this case, due to the fact that the contract does not either specify the amount of the advance payments or indicate how they are to be ascertained. The language of 12 is that the contract price is to be paid 'in monthly payments on account not to exceed in amount 85 per cent of the cost of the work actually erected in the building, provided,' etc. There is no clause, such as is frequently found in contracts of this character, that the amounts payable from time to time shall be ascertained and certified by the architect. The language cannot be construed to oblige the general contractor to pay precisely 85 per cent of the cost of the work done; the use of the words 'not to exceed' forbids this. The paragraph must receive a reasonable construction, and undoubtedly required the general contractor to make substantial payments monthly, fairly approximating, but not exceeding, 85 per cent of the cost of the work. But the proviso requiring the subcontractor of furnish to the general contractor a written requisition did not entitle the subcontractor to be the sole judge of the amount it was entitled to receive. On the contrary, the provision that the requisition should be submitted 'not less than twelve days before payment is required' evidently contemplated \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 282]\n\u00a0\n that the general contractor was to be afforded an opportunity to verify the propriety of the demand made. But the evidence fails to show that the requisitions were based upon the cost of the work, or that any clear statement of such cost was submitted with them. As already pointed out, the parties endeavored to arrive at an agreement about unit prices, in order that these might be employed in making up the requisitions. Whether they did so agree the evidence left in dispute. If the agreement was made, it was at the interview of February 2, 1912. A letter is in evidence, written by plaintiff to defendant under date of February 6, saying: 'In accordance with your instruction to Mr. Converse we have made our January requisition in the units and unit prices used by the government engineer . . . . We inclose formal requisition for $9,012.50 due us under contract.' But the requisition itself was not introduced. The next and last requisition appears to have been made under date March 9, 1912, and this stated: 'Amount of work completed to date, $18,237.' But such details as were furnished do not seem to bear out this estimate. In the state of the record, we cannot say that there was error in the refusal of the requested instruction.\n Error is assigned because of the refusal to instruct the jury as follows:\n'In estimating the recovery to which the plaintiff is entitled, if you find he is entitled to recover, you should consider the reasonable expenditures incurred, the unavoidable losses incident to stoppage, the amount of work actually performed, the amount plaintiff was actually entitled to by reason of such work at the contract price, and the profits which plaintiff could have made if allowed to complete the work under the contract.'\n\n Had the requested application of these elements of damage been confined to the case of plaintiff being found entitled to recover upon the theory that the contract was \n\n[240 U.S. 264, 283]\n\u00a0\n rightfully terminated by the notice of May 22, 1912, we assume it ought to have been granted. United States v. Behan, \n110 U.S. 338\n, 28 L. ed. 168, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 81; Anvil Min. Co. v. Humble, \n153 \nU.S. 540, 551\n, 552 S., 38 L. ed. 814, 817, 818, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 876; Roehm v. Horst, \n178 \nU.S. 1, 21\n, 44 S. L. ed. 953, 961, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 780. But, as already pointed out, other grounds of action were declared upon: (a) defendant's failure to provide granite blocks prior to October 16, 1911; (b) its failure between that date and March 19, 1912, to provide necessary materials and carry on its part of the construction work; and (c) a quantum meruit for labor performed and materials furnished. In the event of plaintiff's recovery being based upon these grounds only, some of the elements indicated in the request would not be properly applicable. The form of the request was such that compliance with it might have misled the jury, and hence there was not error in refusing it.\n Exceptions were taken to the refusal of certain other instructions requested by plaintiff with the object of basing a recovery of damages, including profits, upon the ground of plaintiff having been prevented by defendant's acts from performing its contract within the time specified or a reasonable extension thereof, or on the ground that defendant's refusal to make payments and other breaches of contract were so unreasonable and inexcusable as to indicate an inability or unwillingness on its part to carry out the contract, or to amount to a refusal to perform it in the future, such as to justify plaintiff in stopping work. But these exceptions have not been fully argued, and the requests are perhaps wanting in accuracy; hence, we pass them without consideration.\n Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHALLOWELL v. COMMONS(1916)\nNo. 135\nArgued: Decided: January 10, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 506, 507]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hiram Chase and William Ross King for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Knaebel for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill to establish the equitable title of the plaintiff to an allotment made to Jacob Hallowell, deceased, a member of the Omaha Tribe, in accordance with  5, 6, of the act of August 7, 1882, chap. 434, 22 Stat. at L. 341. The patent to Jacob Hallowell followed the language of  6, and declared that the United States would hold his land for the period of twenty-five years in trust for the sole use of the allottee 'or in case of his decease, of his heirs according to the laws of the state of Nebraska.' The plaintiff says that he is the sole heir as against various other claims set forth in the bill. We do not go into further particulars, as we are of opinion that the circuit court of appeals was right in holding that the district court had no \n\n[239 U.S. 506, 508]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction of the case. 127 C. C. A. 343, 210 Fed. 793.\n It is unnecessary to consider whether there was jurisdiction when the suit was begun. By the act of June 25, 1910, chap. 431, 36 Stat. at L. 855, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4226, it was provided that in a case like this of the death of the allottee intestate during the trust period, the Secretary of the Interior should ascertain the legal heirs of the decedent, and his decision should be final and conclusive; with considerable discretion as to details. This act restored to the Secretary the power that had been taken from him by acts of 1894 [28 Stat. at L. 305, chap. 290] and February 6, 1901, chap. 217, 31 Stat. at L. 760, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4214. McKay v. Kalyton, \n204 \nU.S. 458, 468\n, 51 S. L. ed. 566, 570, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 346. It made his jurisdiction exclusive in terms, it made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal, and so to take away the jurisdiction that for a time had been conferred upon the courts of the United States. The appellant contends for a different construction on the strength of Rev. Stat.  13, Comp. Stat. 1913,  14, that the repeal of any statute shall not extinguish any liability incurred under it (Hertz v. Woodman, \n218 \nU.S. 205, 216\n, 54 S. L. ed. 1001, 1006, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 621), and refers to the decisions upon the statutes concerning suits upon certain bonds given to the United States (United States Fidelity & G. Co. v. United States, \n209 U.S. 306\n, 52 L. ed. 804, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 537). But, apart from a question that we have passed, whether the plaintiff even attempted to rely upon the statutes giving jurisdiction to the courts in allotment cases, the reference of the matter to the Secretary, unlike the changes with regard to suits upon bonds, takes away no substantive right, but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case. In doing so it evinces a change of policy, and an opinion that the rights of the Indians can be better preserved by the quasi paternal supervision of the general head of Indian affairs. The consideration applies with the same force to all cases, and was embodied in a statute that no doubt was intended to apply to all, so far as construction is concerned. \n\n[239 U.S. 506, 509]\n\u00a0\n There is equally little doubt as to the power of Congress to pass the act, so construed. We presume that no one would question it if the suit had not been begun. It is a strong proposition that bringing this bill intensified, strengthened, or enlarged the plaintiff's rights, as suggested in De Lima v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 1, 199\n, 200 S., 45 L. ed. 1041, 1057, 1058, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 743. See Simmons v. Hanover, 23 Pick. 188, 193, 194; Hepburn v. Curts, 7 Watts, 300, 32 Am. Dec. 760; Welch v. Wadsworth, 30 Conn. 149, 154, 79 Am. Dec. 236; Atwood v. Buckingham, 78 Conn. 423, 62 Atl. 616. The difficulty in applying such a proposition to the control of Congress over the jurisdiction of courts of its own creation is especially obvious. See Bird v. United States, \n187 \nU.S. 118, 124\n, 47 S. L. ed. 100, 103, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 42. In any event, the rights of the Indians in this matter remained subject to such control on principles that have been illustrated in many ways. See Marchie Tiger v. Western Invest. Co. \n221 U.S. 286\n, 55 L. ed. 738, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 578; Hallowell v. United States, \n221 U.S. 317\n, 55 L. ed. 750, 31 Sup. Ct.

WOLF BROS. & CO.(1916)\nNo. 37\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1916\n\n\n Co. \n240 U.S. 251\n (1916) ]\n\n\n[240 U.S. 251, 253]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Luke E. Hart, Joseph W. Bailey, H. S. Priest, Morton Jourdan, and Charles B. Howry for petitioner.\n Messrs. Lawrence Maxwell, Simeon M. Johnson, and Percy Werner for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n Respondent, an Ohio corporation engaged in the manufacture of shoes, filed its bill of complaint on January 29, 1906, in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Missouri, eastern division, against petitioner, a Missouri corporation engaged in the same business, seeking an injunction to restrain infringement of an alleged trademark for shoes consisting of the words 'The American Girl,' by the use of the words 'American Lady' as a colorable imitation, and also unfair competition in trade, carried on by means that included the use of the latter words; and praying an accounting of damages and profits. On final hearing the circuit court dismissed the bill. Upon appeal, the circuit court of appeals (91 C. C. A. 363, 165 Fed. 413) held that 'The American Girl' was a geographical name, and, as applied to women's shoes, was descriptive merely of shoes manufactured in America and to be worn by women, and not an arbitrary or fanciful name to indicate the maker, and hence that the term \n\n[240 U.S. 251, 254]\n\u00a0\n as applied to shoes was not the subject of a valid trademark. But the court held that complainant was entitled to be protected against unfair trade; that the record disclosed that it and its predecessors in business had employed the words 'The American Girl' as a trademark continuously since the year 1896, had extensively advertised their shoes under that name, with the catch phrase 'A shoe as good as its name,' in trade journals and newspapers throughout the United States, and largely throughout the southern states, and thus established an extensive trade therefor; and that defendant, by adopting in the year 1900 and thereafter using the name 'The American Lady,' with certain catch phrases, in connection with shoes made by it, and this with full knowledge of complainant's rights, was guilty of unfair competition, tending to and resulting in confusion in the trade, and that complainant was entitled to relief. The decree of the circuit court was therefore reversed, with directions to decree an injunction and an accounting limited to the time since the commencement of the suit.\n Complainant petitioned this court for a writ of certiorari to review that decision, but this was denied. \n214 U.S. 514\n, 53 L. ed. 1063, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 696.\n Thereafter the circuit court, pursuant to the mandate of the court of appeals, made a decree granting an injunction in accordance with the opinion of that court, and referring to a master an accounting of the damages and profits for which defendant might be liable, 'limited to shoes sold by the defendant since the filing of the bill in this case, and which were marked with the name 'American Lady,' and not accompanied with any other matter clearly indicating that such shoes were of the manufacture of the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company.' An accounting was had, extending from the date of the commencement of the suit to March 10, 1910. Complainant made no attempt to introduce substantial proof as to the amount of \n\n[240 U.S. 251, 255]\n\u00a0\n its damages, declaring that they were practically incapable of exact computation. All the testimony was directed to the question of defendant's profits.\n The master reported that during the period covered by the accounting defendant sold 'American Lady' shoes, which, because of differences in marking, he divided into three classes:\n Class 1. 974,016 pairs of shoes bearing the words 'American Lady' stamped upon the sole, and bearing no other impression or distinguishing mark. The profits upon these were found to be $254,401.72.\n Class 2. 961,607 pairs of shoes marked 'American Lady,' with the words 'Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co.,' but without the word 'Makers,' or other matter indicating that the shoes were of defendant's manufacture. The profits upon these were found to be $190,909.83.\n Class 3. 593,872 pairs of shoes marked 'American Lady,' but bearing also the marks 'Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co., Makers.' The profits upon these were found to be $132,740.77.\n The master recommended that a judgment be entered for the profits accruing from the first two classes, aggregating $445,311.55. The profits accruing from the third class he held complainant was not entitled to recover under the opinion of the court of appeals and the decree of the circuit court, entered in accordance with it. Both parties having filed exceptions, the district court (successor of the circuit court), overruled those of complainant, sustained those of defendant, and adjudged a recovery of $1 nominal damages. 192 Fed. 930.\n Complainant appealed to the circuit court of appeals, contending that a decree should have been rendered in its favor for the profits upon the first two classes of shoes, in accordance with the master's recommendation, and that it should have included the profits upon the third class, which were denied by the master. The court of appeals \n\n[240 U.S. 251, 256]\n\u00a0\n reversed the decree, with directions that defendant's exceptions to the master's report be overruled, that the report be confirmed, and that a decree be entered against defendant for the amount recommended by him, with costs, 124 C. C. A. 409, 206 Fed. 611.\n This writ of certiorari having been allowed, we proceed to deal with the questions presented by the record.\n Regarding the case as one of unfair competition without trademark infringement, it is insisted by petitioner that the normal recovery does not include the gains and profits of defendant, according to the rule admittedly applicable in equity to trademark cases, but that the injured party is limited to such damages as it shows it has sustained; and that the present case is devoid of circumstances to take it out of the ordinary rule.\n If, however, complainant was and is entitled to the use of the words 'The American Girl' as a trademark, in the strict sense of the term, and if the proofs adduced before the master, and his findings thereon, are as applicable to a claim of compensation for infringement of the trademark as to a claim of compensation for unfair competition in the absence of trademark, it will not be necessary to pass upon the question of the proper measure of recovery in a non-trademark case. As above pointed out, a claim of trademark right was asserted in the bill, and it has not been abandoned. It was overruled by the circuit court of appeals on the first appeal, upon reasoning with which we are unable to concur. We do not regard the words 'The American Girl,' adopted and employed by complainant in connection with shoes of its manufacture, as being a geographical or descriptive term. It does not signify that the shoes are manufactured in America, or intended to be sold or used in America, nor does it indicate the quality or characteristics of the shoes. Indeed, it does not, in its primary signification, indicate shoes at all. It is a fanciful designation, arbitrarily selected by complainant's \n\n[240 U.S. 251, 257]\n\u00a0\n predecessors to designate shoes of their manufacture. We are convinced that it was subject to appropriation for that purpose, and it abundantly appears to have been appropriated and used by complainant and those under whom it claims.\n The cases cited to the contrary are distinguishable. In Delaware & H. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 324, 20 L. ed. 581, 583, the word 'Lackawanna' was rejected as a trademark for coal because it designated the district in which the coal was produced. In Columbia Mill Co. v. Alcorn, \n150 \nU.S. 460, 466\n, 37 S. L. ed. 1144, 1147, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 151, it was held that 'Columbia' could not be appropriated for exclusive use as a trademark because it was a geographical name. So, with respect to 'Elgin,' as designating watches (Elgin Nat. Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Case Co. \n179 \nU.S. 665, 673\n, 45 S. L. ed. 365, 378, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 270); 'Genesee,' claimed as a trademark for salt (Genesee Salt Co. v. Burnap, 20 C. C. A. 27, 43 U. S. App. 243, 73 Fed. 818); 'Old Country,' as a mark for soap ( Allen B. Wrisley Co. v. Iowa Soap Co. 59 C. C. A. 54, 122 Fed. 796). If the mark here in controversy were 'American Shoes,' these cases would be quite in point. (And see Shaver v. Heller & M. Co. 65 L.R.A. 878, 48 C. C. A. 48, 108 Fed. 821, 826.) But 'The American Girl' would be as descriptive of almost any article of manufacture as of shoes; that is to say, not descriptive at all. The phrase is quite analogous to 'American Express,' held to be properly the subject of exclusive appropriation as a trademark for sealing wax in Dennison Mfg. Co. v. Thomas Mfg. Co. 94 Fed. 651, 653.\n It is contended that this question is settled otherwise, at least as between these parties, by the decision of the circuit court of appeals on the first appeal, and our refusal to review that decision upon complainant's petition for a writ of certiorari, and that the only questions open for review at this time are those that were before the court of appeals upon the second appeal. This, however, is based upon an erroneous view of the nature of our jurisdiction to review the judgments and decrees of the circuit court of \n\n[240 U.S. 251, 258]\n\u00a0\n appeals by certiorari under  240, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231], derived from  6 of the Evarts act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1217. As has been many times declared, this is a jurisdiction to be exercised sparingly, and only in cases of peculiar gravity and general importance, or in order to secure uniformity of decision.

The decree that was sought to be reviewed by certiorari at complainant's instance was not a final one, a fact that of itself alone furnished sufficient ground for the denial of the application; besides which it appears, by reference to our files, that the application was opposed by the present petitioner upon the ground that the case, however important to the parties, involved no question of public interest and general importance, nor any conflict between the decisions of state and Federal courts, or between those of Federal courts of different circuits.\n It is, of course, sufficiently evident that the refusal of an application for this extraordinary writ is in no case equivalent to an affirmance of the decree that is sought to be reviewed. And, although in this instance the interlocutory decision may have been treated as settling 'the law of the case' so as to furnish the rule for the guidance of the referee, the district court, and the court of appeals itself upon the second appeal, this court, in now reviewing the final decree by virtue of the writ of certiorari, is called upon to notice and rectify any error that may have occurred in the interlocutory proceedings.

Anderson, \n225 \nU.S. 436, 444\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1152, 1156, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 739.\n Having reached the conclusion that complainant is entitled to the use of the words 'The American Girl' as a trademark, it results that it is entitled to the profits acquired by defendant from the manifestly infringing sales under the label 'American Lady,'-at least to the extent that such profits are awarded in the decree under review. The right to use a trademark is recognized as a kind of property, of which the owner is entitled to the exclusive enjoyment to the extent that it has been actually used. McLean v. Fleming, \n96 \nU.S. 245, 252\n, 24 S. L. ed. 828, 831; Manhattan Medicine Co. v. Wood, \n108 \nU.S. 218, 224\n, 27 S. L. ed. 706, 708, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 436. The infringer is required in equity to account for and yield up his gains to the true owner, upon a principle analogous to that which charges a trustee with the profits acquired by wrongful use of the property of the cestui que trust. Not that equity assumes jurisdiction upon the ground that a trust exists. As pointed out in Root v. Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. \n105 \nU.S. 189, 214\n, 26 S. L. ed. 975, 984; and Tilghman v. Proctor, \n125 \nU.S. 136, 148\n, 31 S. L. ed. 664, 668, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 894 ( patent cases), the jurisdiction must be rested upon some other equitable ground,-in ordinary cases, as in the present, the right to an injunction- but the court of equity, having acquired jurisdiction upon such a ground, retains it for the purpose of administering complete relief, rather than send the injured party to a court of law for his damages. And profits are then allowed as an equitable measure of compensation, on the theory of a trust ex maleficio. In the courts of England, the rule seems to be that a party aggrieved must elect between damages and profits, and cannot have both. In this country, it is generally held that in a proper case both damages and profits may be awarded. As already observed, the decree under review allows profits only, confines the allowance to such as accrued \n\n[240 U.S. 251, 260]\n\u00a0\n after the commencement of the suit, and excludes all sales where the term 'American Lady' was accompanied with any other matter clearly indicating that such shoes were of the manufacture of the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company. It was construed to exclude all shoes bearing in addition to 'American Lady' the marks 'Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co., Makers.' The account was based upon undisputed data, and no reason is suggested why, if otherwise accurate, it is not as properly applicable upon the theory of trademark as upon that of unfair competition aside from trademark infringement,-at least, so far as defendant is entitled to criticize it; complainant is not attacking the decree.\n It is, however, insisted by defendant (petitioner) that whether the recovery be based upon the theory of trademark, or upon that of unfair competition, the profits recoverable should be limited to such amount as may be shown by direct and positive evidence to be the increment of defendant's income by reason of the infringement, and that the burden of proof is upon complainant to show what part of defendant's profits were attributable to the use of the infringing mark. It is said the true rule is strictly analogous to that applied in patent cases, and Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, 650, 20 L. ed. 860, 865; Elizabeth v. American Nicholson Pav. Co. \n97 \nU.S. 126, 139\n, 24 S. L. ed. 1000, 1006; Garretson v. Clark, \n111 \nU.S. 120, 121\n, 28 S. L. ed. 371, 372, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 291; Dobson v. Hartford Carpet Co. \n114 \nU.S. 439, 444\n, 29 S. L. ed. 177, 178, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 945; Tilghman v. Proctor, \n125 \nU.S. 136, 146\n, 31 S. L. ed. 664, 667, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 894; Keystone Mfg. Co. v. Adams, \n151 \nU.S. 139, 147\n, 38 S. L. ed. 103, 105, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 295; Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Co. v. Wagner Electric & Mfg. Co. \n225 \nU.S. 604, 615\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1222, 1226, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 691; and Dowagiac Mfg. Co. v. Minnesota Moline Plow Co. \n235 U.S. 641\n, 59 L. ed. 398, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 221, are relied upon. The rule invoked is that which, as pointed out in the last two of these cases, is applicable where plaintiff's patent relates to a part only of a machine or combination or process, or to particular improvements in a machine or other device. In such case, where the invention is used in combination with other elements of value not covered by the patent \n\n[240 U.S. 251, 261]\n\u00a0\n so that plaintiff's patent creates only a part of the profits, he is entitled to recover only that part, and must give evidence tending to apportion the profits between the patented and unpatented features. But, as pointed out in the Westinghouse Case (p. 618), there is a recognized exception where the plaintiff carries the burden of proof to the extent of showing the entire profits, but is unable to apportion them, either because of the action of the wrongdoer in confusing his own gains with those which belong to plaintiff, or because of the inherent impossibility of making an approximate apportionment. There, 'on established principles of equity, and on the plainest principles of justice, the guilty trustee cannot take advantage of his own wrong.'\n Assuming the asserted analogy to patent cases to exist, a sufficient reason for not requiring complainant in the present case to make an apportionment between the profits attributable to defendant's use of the offending mark and those attributable to the intrinsic merit of defendant's shoes is that such an apportionment is inherently impossible. Certainly, no formula is suggested by which it could be accomplished. The result of acceding to defendant's contention, therefore, would be to deny all compensation to complainant. And it is to be remembered that defendant does not stand as an innocent infringer. Not only do the findings of the court of appeals, supported by abundant evidence, show that the imitation of complainant's mark was fraudulent, but the profits included in the decree are confined to such as accrued to defendant through its persistence in the unlawful simulation in the face of the very plain notice of complainant's rights that is contained in its bill. As was said by the supreme court of California in a similar case, Graham v. Plate, 40 Cal. 593, 598, 6 Am. Rep. 639, 640: 'In sales made under a simulated trademark it is impossible to decide how much of the profit resulted from the intrinsic value of \n\n[240 U.S. 251, 262]\n\u00a0\n the commodity in the market, and how much from the credit given to it by the trademark. In the very nature of the case it would be impossible to ascertain to what extent he could have effected sales and at what prices except for the use of the trademark. No one will deny that on every principle of reason and justice the owner of the trademark is entitled to so much of the profit as resulted from the use of the trademark. The difficulty lies in ascertaining what proportion of the profit is due to the trademark, and what to the intrinsic value of the commodity; and as this cannot be ascertained with any reasonable certainty, it is more consonant with reason and justice that the owner of the trademark should have the whole profit than that he should be deprived of any part of it by the fraudulent act of the defendant. It is the same principle which is applicable to a confusion of goods. If one wrongfully mixes his own goods with those of another, so that they cannot be distinguished and separated, he shall lose the whole, for the reason that the fault is his; and it is but just that he should suffer the loss rather than an innocent party, who in no degree contributed to the wrong.' To the same effect are Avery v. Meikle, 85 Ky. 435, 448, 7 Am. St. Rep. 604, 610, 3 S. W. 609; El Modello Cigar Mfg. Co. v. Gato, 25 Fla. 886, 915, 6 L.R.A. 823, 829, 23 Am. St. Rep. 537, 544, 7 So. 23; Regis v. Jaynes, 191 Mass. 245, 249, 251, 77 N. E. 774; W. R. Lynn Shoe Co. v. Auburn-Lynn Shoe Co. 100 Me. 461, 479, 4 L.R.A.( N.S.) 960, 62 Atl. 499; Saxlehner v. Eisner & M. Co. 70 C. C. A. 452, 138 Fed. 22, 24.\n Finally, it is contended that the account, as stated by the master and confirmed by the circuit court of appeals, failed to make due allowance for certain items entering into the cost of manufacturing and selling the shoes in diminution of defendant's profits, including interest on capital, depreciation of real estate, taxes, insurance, advertising, and trade discounts. These are matters of fact, respecting which we see no sufficient reason for disturbing the decree. One of the points \n\n[240 U.S. 251, 263]\n\u00a0\n most earnestly insisted upon is that certain overhead charges, appearing on defendant's books as 'Advance Boston House, $73,772.03,' and 'Allowance to Boston, $103,075.14,' of which the amount chargeable pro rata against 'American Lady' shoes not marked 'Makers,' for the period covered by the accounting, was $10,271.69, ought to have been deducted in computing defendant's profits. The only explanation of these charges is in a stipulation of the parties that they 'represent allowances made by the wholesale house of Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company on goods shipped by it to what is known as the 'Boston House', being a separate and distinct corporation from the defendant company, and the amount received by the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company from the 'Boston House' for goods shipped to it was $73,772.03 and $103,075.14 less than the price at which the goods were billed to that house, and those items do not represent moneys paid by the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company to the 'Boston House', or advances by the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company to the 'Boston House.\" If, in the master's calculation of the profits, defendant had been charged with sales of the goods at the prices at which they were billed to the Boston House, the insistence that a deduction of $10,271.69 ought to be allowed as being in the nature of a trade discount would seem correct. But that is not made to appear, and we cannot conclude that the master erred in overruling this allowance.\n Decree affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice Van Devanter are of opinion that the term 'The American Girl,' as applied to women's shoes made and sold in America, is geographical and descriptive, and not subject to exclusive appropriation as a trademark, and that upon this record a recovery of the entire profits is not admissible. They therefore dissent. \n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHANOVER STAR MILLING CO. v. METCALF(1916)\nNo. 23\nArgued: Decided: March 6, 1916\n\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 403, 405]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry Fitts, Edgar L. Clarkson, James E. Morrisette, and John London for petitioner in No. 23, and appellee and respondent in No. 30.\n Messrs. Edward Everett Longan and J. Fred Gilster for respondent in No. 23.\n Messrs. Edward Everett Longan, J. Fred Gilster, and L. O. Whitnel for appellant and petitioner in No. 30.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n These cases were argued together, and may be disposed of in a single opinion.\n In No. 23, the Hanover Star Milling Company, an Illinois corporation engaged in the manufacture of flour in that state, filed a bill in equity on March 4, 1912, in the United States district court for the middle district of Alabama, against Metcalf, a citizen of the state of Alabama and a merchant engaged in the business of selling flour at Greenville, Butler county, in that state, to restrain alleged trademark infringement and unfair competition. The bill averred that for twenty-seven years last past complainant had been engaged in the manufacture of a superior and popular grade of flour, sold by it at \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 406]\n\u00a0\n all times under the name of 'Tea Rose' flour, in a wrapping with distinctive markings, including the words 'Tea Rose' and a design containing three roses imprinted upon labels attached to sacks and barrels; that this flour had been marketed thus by complainant in the state of Alabama for the preceding twelve years, during which time, by maintaining a high and uniform quality, by expensive advertising, and by diligent work of its representatives, it had built up a large and lucrative market, with annual sales of more than $175,000 of Tea Rose flour in that state, and had established a valuable reputation for the name 'Tea Rose' and the distinctive wrappings in Alabama and other states, particularly Georgia and Florida; that until shortly before the commencement of the suit complainant's Tea Rose flour was the only flour made, sold, or offered for sale under that name in Butler county or elsewhere in the state of Alabama, and the name 'Tea Rose' had represented and stood for complainant's flour; and that recently the Steeleville Milling Company, of Steeleville, Illinois, had, through Metcalf's agency, been marketing in Alabama, and particularly in Butler county, flour of its manufacture, in packages and wrappings substantially identical with complainant's and bearing a design containing three roses and the name 'Tea Rose' upon the labels, in a manner calculated to deceive and in fact deceptive to purchasers, thereby threatening pecuniary loss to complainant exceeding $3,000 in amount, and destroying the prestige of complainant's 'Tea Rose' flour, and damaging its trade therein.\n Defendant's answer denied all attempts to deceive purchasers, and further denied complainant's right to the exclusive use of the words 'Tea Rose' or the picture of a rose as a trademark; averred that long prior to complainant's first use of it, and as early as the year 1872, the name had been adopted, appropriated, and used as \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 407]\n\u00a0\n a trademark for flour by the firm of Allen & Wheeler, of Troy, Ohio, and used by it and its successor, the Allen & Wheeler Company, continuously as such; and alleged that the Steeleville Milling Company had used its 'Tea Rose' brand for more than sixteen years last past, and as early as the year 1899 had sold flour in Alabama under that label.\n Upon consideration of the bill and answer and affidavits submitted by the respective parties, the district court granted a temporary injunction restraining Metcalf from selling flour labeled 'Tea Rose,' manufactured by the Steeleville Company or any person, firm, or corporation other than the Hanover Company, at Greenville, or at any other place in the middle district of Alabama. Upon appeal, the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed this decree and remanded the cause, with directions to dismiss the bill. 122 C. C. A. 483, 204 Fed. 211. A writ of certiorari was then allowed by this court.\n In No. 30, the Allen & Wheeler Company, a corporation of the state of Ohio, manufacturing flour at the city of Troy, in that state, filed a bill against the Hanover Star Milling Company on May 23, 1912, in the United States district court for the eastern district of Illinois, averring that in or before the year 1872 the firm of Allen & Wheeler, then engaged in the manufacture of flour at Troy, adopted as a trademark for designating one of its brands the words 'Tea Rose,' and from thence until the year 1904 continuously used that trademark by placing it upon sacks, barrels, and packages containing the brand and quality of flour designated by that term and sold throughout the United States; that in 1904 the Allen & Wheeler Company was incorporated and took over the mills, machinery, stock, trademark, and good will of the firm, since which time the corporation had continued to use the trademark upon flour of its manufacture, and had distributed and sold such flour in the markets \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 408]\n\u00a0\n of the United States, whereby the words 'Tea Rose' had become the common- law trademark of the Allen & Wheeler Company; that recently it had learned that the Hanover Star Milling Company had adopted the words 'Tea Rose' as designating a brand of flour manufactured by it, and, notwithstanding notice of complainant's rights, was persisting in the sale of its flour under that name and threatening to continue so to do; and that defendant had sold large quantities of Tea Rose flour, particularly in the markets of the states of Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi, with large gross sales, and profits approximating $5,000 per year for the past five years, causing damage and loss to complainant in excess of $3,000. An injunction and an accounting of profits were prayed. Upon this bill, a demurrer filed by the Hanover Company, and affidavits presented by both parties, the district court granted a temporary injunction restraining the use of the words 'Tea Rose' as a trademark for flour, without territorial restriction. The circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit reversed this decree, and remanded the cause to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion. L.R.A. --, --, 125 C. C. A. 515, 208 Fed. 513. An appeal was taken to this court, and a writ of certiorari was subsequently granted. The appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, and the case will be disposed of under the writ of certiorari.\n No question is raised respecting the propriety of passing upon the questions at issue on a review of decisions rendered upon applications for temporary injunction. Both district courts granted such injunctions, and both circuit courts of appeals reversed upon grounds that went to the merits. These courts differed upon fundamental questions, and it was because of this that the writs of certiorari were allowed, the situation being such that it was deemed proper to allow them before final decrees \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 409]\n\u00a0\n were made, notwithstanding the general rule to the contrary. American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co. \n148 \nU.S. 372, 378\n, 384 S., 37 L. ed. 486, 489, 491, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 758; The Three Friends, \n166 \nU.S. 1, 49\n, 41 S. L. ed. 897, 913, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 495; The Conqueror, \n166 \nU.S. 110, 113\n, 41 S. L. ed. 937, 939, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 510; Denver v. New York Trust Co. \n229 \nU.S. 123, 133\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1101, 1120, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 657.\n In both cases it was shown without dispute that the firm of Allen & Wheeler adopted and used the words 'Tea Rose' as a trademark for one kind or quality of flour manufactured by it as early as the year 1872, and continued that use until the year 1904, when the Allen & Wheeler Company was incorporated and took over the mills, machinery, stock, trademark, and good will of the firm and succeeded to its business. But there is nothing to show the extent of such use or the markets reached by it, except that in the year 1872 Allen & Wheeler sold three lots of 25 barrels each to a firm in Cincinnati, Ohio, and one lot of 100 barrels to a firm in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; that in the early 70's another firm in Pittsburgh was a customer for this brand; and that in the later 70's a firm in Boston, Massachusetts, was a customer for the same brand. As to the Allen & Wheeler Company, there are affidavits stating in general terms that since its incorporation in 1904, and 'continuously down to the present time,' the company has used the brand 'Tea Rose' for flour; but there is a remarkable absence of particular statements as to time, place, or circumstances; in short, no showing whatever as to the extent of the use or the markets reached. There is nothing to show that the Allen & Wheeler 'Tea Rose' flour has been even advertised in Alabama or the adjoining states, and there is clear and undisputed proof that it has not been sold or offered for sale or known or heard of by the trade in Alabama, Mississippi, or Georgia. In No. 30, there is uncontradicted proof that the Allen & Wheeler Company is selling flour in Alabama and Georgia, but under the brands 'Eldean Patent' and 'Trojan Special.' \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 410]\n\u00a0\n In both suits, the Hanover Star Milling Company introduced affidavits fairly showing that shortly after its incorporation in the year 1885 it adopted for one of its brands of flour the name 'Tea Rose,' and adopted for the package or container, whether sack or barrel, a label bearing the name 'Tea Rose' and the design already referred to; and that this trademark was adopted and used in good faith without knowledge or notice that the name 'Tea Rose' had been adopted or used by the Allen & Wheeler firm, or by anybody else. In 1904 the Hanover Company began and has since prosecuted a vigorous and expensive campaign of advertising its Tea Rose flour, covering the whole of the state of Alabama, and parts of Mississippi, Georgia, and Florida, employing many ingenious and interesting devices that are detailed in the proofs, with the result that at the commencement of the litigation its sales of Tea Rose flour in these markets amounted to more than $150,000 a year, the Hanover Star Milling Company has come to be known as the Tea Rose mill, the reputation of the mill is bound up with the reputation of Tea Rose flour, and 'Tea Rose' in the flour trade in the territory referred to means flour of the Hanover Companys' manufacture. There is nothing to show any present or former competition in Tea Rose flour between the latter company and the Allen & Wheeler firm or corporation, or that either party has even advertised that brand of flour in territory covered by the activities of the other.\n Metcalf's purchases of competing Tea Rose flour, which gave rise to the suit brought by the Hanover Company against him, were made from the Steeleville Milling Company, an Illinois corporation, which appears to have adopted the name and design of a tea rose for flour in the year 1895\n\n\n It should be added that, so far as appears, none of the parties here concerned has registered the trademark \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 411]\n\u00a0\n under any act of Congress or under the law of any state. Nor does it appear that in any of the states in question there exists any peculiar local rule, arising from statute or decision. Hence, the cases must be decided according to common-law principles of general application.\n Interesting and important questions are raised concerning the territorial extent of trademark rights. In behalf of the Hanover Company it is, in effect, insisted: (a) that the failure of the Allen & Wheeler Company and its predecessors to enter the southeastern territory with their Tea Rose flour, and the fact that such flour has been and is wholly unknown there under that name, disentitle it to interfere with the Hanover Company's trade established in good faith in that territory under the same mark; (b) that the same considerations entitle Hanover to affirmative trademark rights of its own, enforceable against the Steeleville Company and everybody else over whom it has priority in that territory; and (c) that Hanover is entitled to relief against Steeleville and against Metcalf as its agent, upon the ground of unfair competition in trade regardless of the trademark right. An affirmative answer to the first proposition will decide the Allen & Wheeler case (No. 30) in favor of Hanover, and an affirmative answer to the third proposition will decide the Metcalf case ( No. 23) in favor of Hanover, irrespective of the disposition that might be made of the second proposition. In view of possible consequences to the rights of parties not before the court, it is desirable to limit the range of our decision as much as practicable, especially as the proofs now before us are incomplete and in some respects unsatisfactory.\n In will be convenient to dispose first of No. 30. Here the bill is rested upon alleged trademark infringement, pure and simple, and no question of unfair competition is involved. The decision of the court of appeals for the seventh circuit in favor of the Hanover Company and \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 412]\n\u00a0\n against the Allen & Wheeler Company was rested upon the ground that although the adoption of the Tea Rose mark by the latter antedated that of the Hanover Company, its only trade, so far as shown, was in territory north of the Ohio river, while the Hanover Company had adopted 'Tea Rose' as its mark in perfect good faith, with no knowledge that anybody else was using or had used those words in such a connection, and during many years it had built up and extended its trade in the southeastern territory, comprising Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi, so that in the flour trade in that territory the mark 'Tea Rose' had come to mean the Hanover Company's flour, and nothing else. The court held in effect that the right to protection in the exclusive use of a trademark extends only to those markets where the trader's goods have become known and identified by his use of the mark; and because of the nonoccupancy by the Allen & Wheeler Company of the southeastern markets it had no ground for relief in equity. Let us test this by reference to general principles.\n The redress that is accorded in trademark cases is based upon the party's right to be protected in the good will of a trade or business. The primary and proper function of a trademark is to identify the origin or ownership of the article to which it is affixed. Where a party has been in the habit of labeling his goods with a distinctive mark, so that purchasers recognize goods thus marked as being of his production, others are debarred from applying the same mark to goods of the same description, because to do so would in effect represent their goods to be of his production and would tend to deprive him of the profit he might make through the sale of the goods which the purchaser intended to buy. Courts afford redress or relief upon the ground that a party has a valuable interest in the good will of his trade or business, and in the trademarks adopted to maintain and extend it. The essence of the \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 413]\n\u00a0\n wrong consists in the sale of the goods of one manufacturer or vendor for those of another. Delaware & H. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 322, 20 L. ed. 581, 583; McLean v. Fleming, \n96 \nU.S. 245, 251\n, 24 S. L. ed. 828, 830; Amoskeag Mfg. Co. v. Trainer, \n101 \nU.S. 51, 53\n, 25 S. L. ed. 993, 994; Menendez v. Holt, \n128 \nU.S. 514, 520\n, 32 S. L. ed. 526, 527, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 143; Lawrence Mfg. Co. v. Tennessee Mfg. Co. \n138 \nU.S. 537, 546\n, 34 S. L. ed. 997. 1003, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 396.\n This essential element is the same in trademark cases as in cases of unfair competition unaccompanied with trademark infringement. In fact, the common law of trademarks is but a part of the broader law of unfair competition. Elgin Nat. Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Case Co. \n179 \nU.S. 665, 674\n, 45 S. l. ed. 365, 379, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 270; G. & C. Merriam Co. v. Saalfield, 117 C. C. A. 245, 198 Fed. 369, 372; Cohen v. Nagle, 190 Mass. 4, 8, 15, 2 L.R.A.(N.S.) 964, 76 N. E. 276, 5 Ann. Cas. 553, 555, 558.\n Common-law trademarks, and the right to their exclusive use, are, of course, to be classed among property rights (Trade-Mark Cases, \n100 \nU.S. 82, 92\n, 93 S., 25 L. ed. 550, 551); but only in the sense that a man's right to the continued enjoyment of his trade reputation and the good will that flows from it, free from unwarranted interference by others, is a property right, for the protection of which a trademark is an instrumentality. As was said in the same case (p. 94), the right grows out of use, not mere adoption. In the English courts it often has been said that there is no property whatever in a trademark, as such. per Ld. Langdale, M. R., in Perry v. Truefitt, 6 Beav. 73; per Vice Chancellor Sir Wm. Page Wood ( afterwards Ld. Hatherly), in Collins Co. v. Brown, 3 Kay & J. 423, 426, 3 Jur. N. S. 930, 5 Week. Rep. 676; per Ld. Herschell in Reddaway v. Banham [ 1896] A. C. 199, 209, 65 L. J. Q. B. N. S. 381, 74 L. T. N. S. 289, 44 Week. Rep. 638, 25 Eng. Rul. Cas. 193. But since in the same cases the courts recognize the right of the party to the exclusive use of marks adopted to indicate goods of his manufacture, upon the ground that 'a man is not to sell his own goods under the pretense that they are the goods of another man; he cannot be permitted to practise such a deception, nor to use the means which contribute to that end. He cannot therefore be \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 414]\n\u00a0\n allowed to use names, marks, letters, or other indicia, by which he may induce purchasers to believe that the goods which he is selling are the manufacture of another person' (6 Beav. 73); it is plain that in denying the right of property in a trademark it was intended only to deny such property right except as appurtenant to an established business or trade in connection with which the mark is used. This is evident from the expressions used in these and other English cases. Thus, in Ainsworth v. Walmsley, L. R. 1 Eq. 518, 524, Vice Chancellor Sir Wm. Page Wood said: 'This court has taken upon itself to protect a man in the use of a certain trademark as applied to a particular description of article. He has no property in that mark per se, any more than in any other fanciful denomination he may assume for his own private use, otherwise than with reference to his trade. If he does not carry on a trade in iron, but carries on a trade in linen, and stamps a lion on his linen, another person may stamp a lion on iron; but when he has appropriated a mark to a particular species of goods, and caused his goods to circulate with this mark upon them, the court has said that no one shall be at liberty to defraud that man by using that mark, and passing off goods of his manufacture as being the goods of the owner of that mark.'\n In short, the trademark is treated as merely a protection for the good will, and not the subject of property except in connection with an existing business. The same rule prevails generally in this country, and is recognized in the decisions of this court already cited. See also Apollinaris Co. v. Scherer, 23 Blatchf. 459, 27 Fed. 18, 20; Levy v. Waitt, 25 L.R.A. 190, 10 C. C. A. 227, 21 U. S. App. 394, 61 Fed. 1008, 1011; Macmahan Pharmacal Co. v. Denver Chemical Mfg. Co. 51 C. C. A. 302, 113 Fed. 468, 471, 475; Congress & E. Spring Co. v. High Rock Congress Spring Co. 57 Barb. 526, 551; Weston v. Ketcham, 51 How. Pr. 455, 456; Candee v. Deere, 54 Ill. 439, 457; Avery v. Meikle, 81 Ky. 73, 86. \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 415]\n\u00a0\n Expressions are found in many of the cases to the effect that the exclusive right to the use of a trademark is founded on priority of appropriation. Thus, in Delaware & H. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 323, 20 L. ed. 581, 583, reference is made to 'the first appropriator;' in McLean v. Fleming, \n96 \nU.S. 245, 251\n, 24 S. L. ed. 828, 830, to 'the person who first adopted the stamp;' in Amoskeag Mfg. Co. v. Trainer, \n101 \nU.S. 51, 53\n, 25 S. L. ed. 993, 994, the expression is 'any symbol or devise, not previously appropriated, which will distinguish,' etc. But these expressions are to be understood in their application to the facts of the cases decided. In the ordinary case of parties competing under the same mark in the same market, it is correct to say that prior appropriation settles the question. But where two parties independently are employing the same mark upon goods of the same class, but in separate markets wholly remote the one from the other, the question of prior appropriation is legally insignificant; unless, at least, it appear that the second adopter has selected the mark with some design inimical to the interests of the first user, such as to take the benefit of the reputation of his goods, to forestall the extension of his trade, or the like.\n Of course, if the symbol or device is already in general use, employed in such a manner that its adoption as an index of source or origin would only produce confusion and mislead the public, it is not susceptible of adoption as a trademark. Such a case was Columbia Mill Co. v. Alcorn, \n150 \nU.S. 460, 464\n, 37 S. L. ed. 1144, 1146, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 151, affirming 40 Fed. 676, where it appeared that before complainant's adoption of the disputed word as a brand for its flour the same word was used for the like purpose by numerous mills in different parts of the country.\n That property in a trademark is not limited in its enjoyment by territorial bounds, but may be asserted and protected wherever the law affords a remedy for wrongs, is true in a limited sense. Into whatever markets the use of a trademark has extended, or its meaning has become \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 416]\n\u00a0\n known, there will the manufacturer or trader whose trade is pirated by an infringing use be entitled to protection and redress. But this is not to say that the proprietor of a trademark, good in the markets where it has been employed, can monopolize markets that his trade has never reached, and where the mark signifies not his goods, but those of another. We agree with the court below (L.R.A.--, --, 125 C. C. A. 515, 208 Fed. 519) that 'since it is the trade, and not the mark, that is to be protected, a trademark acknowledges no territorial boundaries of municipalities or states or nations, but extends to every market where the trader's goods have become known and identified by his use of the mark. But the mark, of itself, cannot travel to markets where there is no article to wear the badge and no trader to offer the article.'\n To say that a trademark right is not limited in its enjoyment by territorial bounds is inconsistent with saying that it extends as far as the sovereignty in which it has been enjoyed. If the territorial bounds of sovereignty do not limits, how can they enlarge such a right? And if the mere adoption and use of a trademark in a limited market shall (without statute) create an exclusive ownership of the mark throughout the bounds of the sovereignty, the question at once arises, 'What sovereignty?' So far as the proofs disclose, the Allen & Wheeler mark has not been used at all, is not known at all in a market sense, within the sovereignty of Alabama, or the adjacent states, where the controversy with the Hanover Star Milling Company arose. And so far as the controversy concerns intrastate distribution as distinguished from interstate trade, the subject is not within the sovereign powers of the United States. Trade- Mark Cases, \n100 \nU.S. 82, 93\n, 25 S. L. ed. 550, 551.\n We are referred to an expression contained in the opinion of this court in Kidd v. Johnson, \n100 \nU.S. 617, 619\n, 25 S. L. ed. 769, 770: 'The right to use the trademark is not limited to any place, city, or state, and, therefore, must be deemed \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 417]\n\u00a0\n to extend everywhere.' But a reference to the facts of the case, and the context, shows that the language was not used in the sense attributed to it in the argument. The question presented for decision related to the ownership of a trademark used by complainants (Johnson & Company) on packages and barrels containing whisky, manufactured and sold by them in Cincinnati, and this turned in part upon the force to be given to a written transfer executed by one Pike, and delivered to complainant's predecessors in business in connection with a sale of the distillery and its appurtenances, which were Pike's individual property. Kidd, the defendant, claimed the right to use the same mark as surviving partner of a firm of which Pike had been a member. The court, speaking by Mr. Justice Field, said (p. 619): 'That transfer was plainly designed to confer whatever right Pike possessed. It, in terms, extends the use of the trademark to Mills, Johnson, & Company and their successors. Such use, to be of any value, must necessarily be exclusive. If others also could use it, the trademark would be of no service in distinguishing the whisky of the manufacturer in Cincinnati; and thus the company would lose all the benefit arising from the reputation the whisky there manufactured had acquired in the market. The right to use the trademark is not limited to any place, city, or state, and, therefore, must be deemed to extend everywhere.' This does not import that the trademark right assigned was greater in extent than the trade in which it was used. The record in the case showed that complainant's trade had been extended to New Orleans, and the controversy arose out of sales made there by defendants as licensees of Kidd. It was admitted in the answer that they had sold whisky in competition with that of complainants at New Orleans, and under the same trademark, and the case was by stipulation treated as a test case to settle whether Johnson & Company or Kidd had the \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 418]\n\u00a0\n exclusive right, or whether they had a joint right, to the use of the mark.\n We are also referred to Derringer v. Plate, 29 Cal. 292, 295, 87 Am. Dec. 170, in which it was said by the court: 'The manufacturer at Philadelphia who has adopted and uses a trademark, has the same right of property in it at New York or San Francisco that he has at his place of manufacture.' In that case plaintiff averred that he was a resident of Philadelphia, and upwards of thirty years before the action invented a pistol and adopted as a trademark for it the words 'Derringer, Philadel.,' which was and ever since had been his trademark, and which he had caused to be stamped on the breech of all pistols manufactured and sold by him; and that the defendant since 1858 had been engaged in the manufacture of pistols at San Francisco similar to plaintiff's, on the breech of which he had stamped plaintiff's trademark, etc. The report of the case shows (p. 294) that the only question presented was whether the California statute of 1863 concerning trademarks had repealed or abrogated the remedies afforded by the common law in trademark cases. This was answered in the negative, and in the course of the reasoning the court said, p. 295: 'The right is not limited in its enjoyment by territorial bounds, but, subject only to such statutory regulations as may be properly made concerning the use and enjoyment of other property, or the evidences of title to the same, the proprietor may assert and maintain his property right wherever the common law affords remedies for wrongs;' continuing with what we have first quoted. Although not expressly stated, it is implicit in the report that plaintiff's pistols were on the market in San Francisco, and his trademark known there and imitated by defendant for that very reason. It was such a mark as could not be accidentally hit upon.\n It results from the general principles thus far discussed that trademark rights, like others that rest in user, may \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 419]\n\u00a0\n be lost by abandonment, nonuser, laches, or acquiescence. Abandonment, in the strict sense, rests upon an intent to abandon; and we have no purpose to qualify the authority of Saxlehner v. Eisner & M. Co. \n179 \nU.S. 19, 31\n, 45 S. L. ed. 60, 73, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 7, to that effect. As to laches and acquiescence, it has been repeatedly held, in cases where defendants acted fraudulently or with knowledge of plaintiffs' rights, that relief by injunction would be accorded although an accounting of profits should be denied. McLean v. Fleming, \n96 \nU.S. 245, 257\n, 24 S. L. ed. 828, 833; Menendez v. Holt, \n128 \nU.S. 514, 523\n, 32 S. L. ed. 526, 528, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 143; Saxlehner v. Eisner & M. Co. \n179 \nU.S. 19, 39\n, 45 S. L. ed. 60, 76, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 7. So much must be regarded as settled. But cases differ according to their circumstances, and neither of those cited is in point with the present. Allowing to the Allen & Wheeler firm and corporation the utmost that the proofs disclose in their favor, they have confined their use of the 'Tea Rose' trademark to a limited territory, leaving the southeastern states untouched. Even if they did not know-and it does not appear that they did know-that the Hanover Company was doing so, they must be held to have taken the risk that some innocent party might, during their forty years of inactivity, hit upon the same mark and expend money and effort in building up a trade in flour under it. If, during the long period that has elapsed since the last specified sale of Allen & Wheeler 'Tea Rose'-this was 'in the later 70's'-that flour has been sold in other parts of the United States, excluding the southeastern states, no clearer evidence of abandonment by nonuser of trademark rights in the latter field could reasonably be asked for. And when it appears, as it does, that the Hanover Company in good faith and without notice of the Allen & Wheeler mark has expended much money and effort in building up its trade in the southeastern market, so that 'Tea Rose' there means Hanover Company's flour and nothing else, the Allen & Wheeler Company is estopped to assert trademark infringement as to that territory. \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 420]\n\u00a0\n The extent and character of that territory, and its remoteness from that in which the Allen & Wheeler mark is known, are circumstances to be considered. Alabama alone-to say nothing of the other states in question- has an area of over 50,000 square miles, and by the census of 1910 contained a population of more than 2,000,000. Its most northerly point is more than 250 miles south of Cincinnati, which is the nearest point at which sales of Allen & Wheeler 'Tea Rose' are shown to have been made, and these at a time antedating by approximately forty years the commencement of the present controversy. We are not dealing with a case where the junior appropriation of a trademark in occupying territory that would probably be reached by the prior user in the natural expansion of his trade, and need pass no judgment upon such a case. Under the circumstances that are here presented, to permit the Allen & Wheeler Company to use the mark in Alabama, to the exclusion of the Hanover Company, would take the trade and good will of the latter company-built up at much expense and without notice of the former's rights-and confer it upon the former, to the complete perversion of the proper theory of trademark rights.\n The case is peculiar in its facts; and we have found none precisely like it. The recent case of Theodore Rectanus Co. v. United Drug Co. (C. C. A. 6th C.) 226 Fed. 545, 549, 553, is closely analogous.\n We come now to No. 23. The court of appeals (122 C. C. A. 483, 204 Fed. 211) denied relief to the Hanover Company against Metcalf under the head of trademark infringement partly upon the ground that Allen & Wheeler were the first appropriators of the mark, and that it had been continuously used by that firm and its successor down to the time of the suit, but principally upon the ground that, irrespective of whether this use was so general or continuous as to exclude other appropriations, the evidence \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 421]\n\u00a0\n showed a use of the same brand by the Steeleville Company commencing in the year 1895, and carried on in the states of Illinois, Tennessee, Indiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi, with occasional shipments into Alabama,- a use so extensive and continuous as to exclude the claim of the Hanover Company to either first appropriation or exclusive use in any of the territory from which it sought to expel Metcalf; and that 'the Steeleville Milling Company's first use and its extensive and continuous use established by the evidence in the territory of its selection gave it the unqualified right to extend unhampered its trade in flour under the Tea Rose brand into any part of the United States, and that, too, without incurring the legal odium of unfair competition.' Relief under the head of unfair competition was denied upon the ground that the Hanover Company had not clearly shown that it had established by prior adoption the exclusive right to dress its goods in the manner claimed.\n Upon the question of trademark rights as between the Hanover and the Steeleville companies (leaving Allen & Wheeler out of the question), the proofs are somewhat conflicting. There is evidence that Hanover's use of the Tea Rose brand antedated the year 1893, and probably began as early as 1886. The extent and particulars of such use, prior to the year 1903, are not made to appear. On the other hand, Steeleville appears to have adopted the brand in the year 1895, and used it in trade in Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas; the extent and particulars of the use not being shown. Sharp competition appears to have been carried on between the two companies in selling flour under the Tea Rose brand at Meridian, Mississippi, in the years 1903 to 1905, with the result that the Hanover Company, claiming that its use of the mark for flour had antedated that of the Steeleville Company, succeeded in obtaining a favorable decision in an informal arbitration by officials of the Millers \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 422]\n\u00a0\n National Federation; and for this or some other reason Steeleville appears to have retired and left the Hanover Company in complete control of the Meridian market. Aside from the business done by the Steeleville Company at Meridian, there is no proof of business done by it in the southeastern states, except that it made an isolated sale of Tea Rose flour to a merchant at Whistler, Alabama, in the year 1899, the quantity not stated, and two isolated sales, involving a small quantity in each case, one to a retailer in Tupelo, Mississippi, in the year 1910, the other to a retailer in West Point, Mississippi, in January, 1912.\n As we regard the proofs, they do not sustain the view of the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit either as to first use or as to extensive, continuous, or exclusive use of the Tea Rose brand by the Steeleville Company, and there is nothing in the history of the use of the brand in the disputed territory to deprive the Hanover Company of its right to be protected at least against unfair competition at the hands of the Steeleville Company or of Metcalf as its representative.\n That there was such unfair competition, commenced by Metcalf shortly before the bringing of the suit, the proofs clearly show. Repeating that since the year 1904 the Hanover Company had extensively advertised its Tea Rose flour throughout the state of Alabama and parts of Mississippi, Georgia, and Florida, with the result that its sales of that flour in those markets amounted to more than $150,000 a year, while the Hanover Star Milling Company had come to be known as the Tea Rose mill, and the words 'Tea Rose' in the flour trade in that territory meant flour of the Hanover Company's manufacture and nothing else, and that, except for isolated sales in Mississippi in 1910 and 1912, already mentioned, no Tea Rose flour other than that of the Hanover Company had been sold in that territory for a number of \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 423]\n\u00a0\n years, it further should be stated that Hanover Tea Rose was distributed in Butler County and adjoining counties in Alabama by the McMullan Grocery Company, whose place of business was at Greenville. They had built up a large trade for this flour in Butler county and the neighboring counties of Conecuh, Covington, Lowndes, and Crenshaw. The McMullan Company had the exclusive sale of the Hanover Company's Tea Rose flour, so that Metcalf, who likewise did business at Greenville, was unable to procure it for distribution to his customers. A short time before the suit was commenced, however, he announced to the public and the trade in Butler county that he had secured Tea Rose flour, and on receiving a consignment from the Steeleville Company, which was labeled 'Tea Rose' and put up in packages closely resembling those used by the Hanover Company,-so closely that, according to the undisputed evidence, they are 'calculated to and do in fact deceive the ordinary and casual purchaser of flour into the belief that he is purchasing the article of that name manufactured by the said Hanover Star Milling Company,'-Metcalf put large banners on his mules and dray, advertising to the public that he had received a shipment of Tea Rose flour, and that it was 'Steeleville Milling Company's Tea Rose flour, best quality.' Metcalf and his traveling salesman who marketed the greater part of this consignment, and several parties who purchased it in lots of from one to ten barrels, deposed that it was not sold under a representation that it was manufactured by the Hanover Company, but, on the contrary, that it was Tea Rose flour manufactured by the Steeleville Milling Company. But Metcalf's purpose to take advantage of the reputation of the Hanover Company's Tea Rose flour is so manifest, and the tendency of the similarity of the brand and accompanying design, and of the make-up of the packages, to mislead ultimate consumers, is so evident, that it seems to \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 424]\n\u00a0\n us a case of unfair competition is made out. The circumstances strongly indicate a fraudulent intent to palm off the Steeleville Tea Rose flour upon customers as being the same as the Tea Rose flour made by complainant, the reputation of which is shown to be so well established. The mere substitution of 'Steeleville' in the place of 'Hanover' on the labels is not convincing either that the intent is innocent or that the result will be innocuous, since it is accompanied with the words 'Tea Rose' (shown to have acquired a secondary meaning), and with the distinctive wrapping, both indicative in that market of complainant's flour. Complainant is thus shown to be entitled to an injunction against Metcalf, irrespective of its claim to affirmative trademark rights in that territory. Coats v. Merrick Thread Co. \n149 \nU.S. 562, 566\n, 37 S. L. ed. 847, 850, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 966; Elgin Nat. Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Case Co. \n179 \nU.S. 665, 674\n, 45 S. L. ed. 365, 379, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 270. Adjudication of the latter claim may be made, if necessary, upon final hearing, when the proofs will presumably be more complete than they now are.\n It results that the decree under review in No. 23 should be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion, and that the decree in No. 30 should be affirmed.\n Decree in No. 23 reversed.\n Appeal in No. 30 dismissed.\n Decree in No. 30 affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, concurring:\n I am disposed to agree that the decree dismissing the bill of the Hanover Star Milling Company should be reversed and that the decree denying a preliminary injunction to the Allen & Wheeler Company should be affirmed, and I agree in the main with the reasoning of the court, so far as it goes. But I think it necessary to go farther even on the assumption that we are dealing with \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 425]\n\u00a0\n the question of trademarks in the several states only so far as commerce among the states is not concerned. The question before us, on that assumption, is a question of state law, since the rights that we are considering are conferred by the sovereignty of the state in which they are acquired. This seems to be too obvious to need the citation of authority, but it is a necessary corollary of the Trade-Mark Cases, \n100 U.S. 82\n, 25 L. ed. 550. Those cases decided that Congress cannot deal with trademarks as used in commerce wholly between citizens of the same state. It follows that the states can deal with them, as in fact they sometimes do by statute (Mass. Rev. Laws, chap. 72,  2, 3), and when not by statute by their common law.\n As the common law of the several states has the same origin for the most part, and as their law concerning trademarks and unfair competition is the same in its general features, it is natural and very generally correct to say that trademarks acknowledge no territorial limits. But it never should be forgotten, and in this case it is important to remember, that when a trademark started in one state in recognized in another it is by the authority of a new sovereignty that gives its sanction to the right. The new sovereignty is not a passive figurehead. It creates the right within its jurisdiction, and what it creates it may condition, as by requiring the mark to be recorded, or it may deny. The question, then, is what is the common law of Alabama in cases like these. It appears to me that if a mark previously unknown in that state has been used and given a reputation there, the state well may say that those who have spent their money innocently in giving it its local value are not to be defeated by proof that others have used the mark earlier in another jurisdiction more or less remote. Until I am compelled to adopt a different view I shall assume that that is the common law of the state. It appears to me that the foundation of the right as stated by the court requires that conclusion. See, \n\n[240 U.S. 403, 426]\n\u00a0\n further, Chadwick v. Covell, 151 Mass. 190, 193, 194, 6 L.R.A. 839, 21 Am. St. Rep. 442, 23 N. E. 1068. Those who have used the mark within the state are those who will be defrauded if another can come in and reap the reward of their efforts on the strength of a use elsewhere over which Alabama has no control.\n I think state lines, speaking always of matters outside the authority of Congress, are important in another way. I do not believe that a trademark established in Chicago could be used by a competitor in some other part of Illinois on the ground that it was not known there. I think that if it is good in one part of the state, it is good in all. But when it seeks to pass state lines, it may find itself limited by what has been done under the sanction of a power co-ordinate with that of Illinois and paramount over the territory concerned. If this view be adopted we get rid of all questions of penumbra, of shadowy marches where it is difficult to decide whether the business extends to them. We have sharp lines drawn upon the fundamental consideration of the jurisdiction originating the right. In most cases the change of jurisdiction will not be important because the new law will take up and apply the same principles as the old; but when, as here, justice to its own people requires a state to set a limit, it may do so, and this court cannot pronounce its action wrong. \n\n\n\n","80":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAPAI v. BROWN(1916)\nNo. 120\nArgued: December 17, 1915Decided: January 10, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 502, 503]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lorrin Andrews for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. A. A. Wilder, Alexander Britton, Evans Browne, and F. W. Clements for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill to quiet title to an undivided 29\/36 of the ahupuaa of Kaonoulu, a large tract of land in the island of Maui, territory of Hawaii The plaintiffs claim through the children of one Keaka other than one daughter, Paakuku, through whom the defendants claim the whole tract.\n One of the defenses was res judicata. The proceeding relied upon as having decided the relative rights of the parties was a bill brought in November, 1871, by the plaintiffs' predecessors against Paakuku and others, alleging title in Keaka during her life; a devise by her to her heirs, followed by joint possession on the part of the plaintiffs and of Paakuku as quasi trustee; and waste, a wrongful sale and a wrongful lease by Paakuku. The bill prayed for an account from Paakuku, that the sale and lease be ordered to be canceled as against the plaintiffs, and that a partition be decreed. Paakuku's answer set up a conveyance of the premises by Keaka to her in fee, and continuous possession by her since the date of the same. It also alleged that Keaka's will, if not overridden by the subsequent deed, devised the land to Paakuku in fee, subject to some merely personal and revocable rights in some of the plaintiffs. \n\n[239 U.S. 502, 504]\n\u00a0\n The case was tried in the supreme court before the Chief Justice. On October 1, 1874, a minute was entered: 'The opinion of the court is that the petitioners have no title to the lands of Kaonoulu and Kaluapulu and so adjudge. There is no controversy about the title of the land at Wailuku and the petition for partition of that land is hereby granted and decreed accordingly.' An opinion filed two days later discusses the title, decides that the deed alleged by Paakuku is freed from every suspicion, and repeats the language of the minute. On October 12 it was decreed that the plaintiffs take nothing by their bill. The supreme court in the present case expressed the opinion which, apart from the deference due to it upon a local matter, does not require argument to support it, that the intention and meaning of the decree of October 12 was to dismiss the bill on the ground that the plaintiffs had not the title alleged. It therefore affirmed a judgment for the defendants, holding that the plaintiffs were concluded by the former decree. The only point, if any, that can be argued, is that in general a bill for partition cannot be made a means of trying a disputed title (Clark v. Roller, \n199 \nU.S. 541, 545\n, 50 S. L. ed. 300, 302, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141), and that therefore the decree should be taken to be a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, or at least allowed no greater effect than if it had gone on that ground.\n But, as we cannot doubt the import of the decree when rendered, we are narrowed in our inquiry to the question of jurisdiction in an accurate sense. Unless we are prepared to pronounce the decree void for want of power to pass it, and open to collateral attack, the decision in this case must stand. But there was no inherent difficulty, no impossibility in the nature of things or for want of physical power, in the attempt to decide title in the suit of 1871. And, as was observed at the last term, it would seem surprising to suggest that the highest court in the Hawaiian Islands did not know its own powers, or decide in accord- \n\n[239 U.S. 502, 505]\n\u00a0\n ance with the requirements of the law of which that court was the final mouthpiece. John Ii Estate v. Brown, \n235 \nU.S. 342, 349\n, 59 S. L. ed. 259, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 106. The plaintiffs in the former case in no way protested against the trial of their title, but, on the contrary, Sought relief distinct from partition, that made the trial necessary. Even if we were disposed to go behind the decisions of the Chief Justice of the Kingdom and of the highest court of the territory upon a matter like this, it would seem to us as unreasonable to hold the adjudication of title void because partition was prayed as to hold it void because the decree was made upon a multifarious bill. The cases where objections to the jurisdiction, though taken in the cause, have been held to have been waived, go farther than we have to go here. We will not speculate as to how extreme a case must be to produce a different result; it is enough that this is far from the line.\n The defendants in error filed a motion to dismiss, which, in view of our opinion upon the merits, they probably would not care to press, but which we are not at liberty to disregard. The case is brought here by writ of error, whereas, it is said, it should have been brought up by appeal. By  246 of the Judicial Code of March 3, 1911, chap. 231, 36 Stat. at L. 1087, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1223, writs of error and appeals from the final judgments and decrees of the supreme court of Hawaii may be taken 'in the same manner, under the same regulations, and in the same classes of cases, in which' they may be taken from the final judgments and decrees of the court of a state, 'and also in all cases wherein the amount involved, exclusive of costs, . . . exceeds the sum or value of five thousand dollars.' The present suit comes here under the last clause; at the trial a jury was waived, and the proposition is that the earlier provisions of the section do not govern this clause, but that, except when there is a trial by jury, the cases there mentioned must be brought to this court by appeal under the act of April 7, 1874, chap. 80,  2, 18 Stat. at L. 27, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1652. It is said that \n\n[239 U.S. 502, 506]\n\u00a0\n this has been the practice. See, e. g., William W. Bierce v. Hutchins, \n205 U.S. 340\n, 51 L. ed. 828, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524. Whether or not the incidental assumption in that decision that an appeal would lie was correct, we are of the opinion that the proceeding by writ of error was justified by the plain meaning of  246. So far as the policy of Congress might permit (see act of March 3, 1915, chap. 90,  274b, 38 Stat. at L. 956), we should be disposed to be a little astute to save a party's rights from being lost through mistakes upon a technical matter in the somewhat confused condition of the statutes. But we cannot doubt that the path adopted was right.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOLMES v. CONWAY(1916)\nNo. 335\nArgued: May 1, 1916Decided: June 12, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 624, 625]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. leonard S. Ferry, Thomas F. Doran, and John S. Dean for plaintiff in error.\n No counsel appeared for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 624, 626]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff in error, Holmes, a lawyer practising before the courts of Kansas, maintains that judgment has been rendered against him, in a cause where he appeared as counsel, without notice or opportunity to defend, contrary to inhibitions of the 14th Amendment.\n Acting for one Hess, he instituted proceedings against defendant in error in the district court, Woodson county, Kansas, seeking personal judgment on a note and foreclosure of mortgage on real estate. Judgment was rendered November 16, 1910, for $2,612; and the sheriff sold the land January 19, 1911, to Hess, for $1,700, subject to redemption within eighteen months. An assignment prepared by Holmes immediately transferred the certificate of purchase to C. F. Harder, but no public record of this transaction was made until August 24, 1912\n\n\n An insured building on the mortgaged property burned shortly before sheriff's sale, and, upon motion presented by Holmes, the court made an order 'restraining and enjoining the said defendant Conway from in any manner disposing of said insurance policies upon the buildings on said mortgaged premises, or disposing of any moneys \n\n[241 U.S. 624, 627]\n\u00a0\n collected.' Questions arose concerning validity of policies, and, following an agreement between Holmes and Hogueland, attorney for Conway, a compromise was effected under which the companies paid $1,075,-$500, February ___, 1911, and $575, March ___, 1911. Conway and his attorney claimed that, under the agreement, this sum was to be applied towards redeeming the land. Holmes claimed it was to go towards discharging the personal judgment.\n On February 24, 1911, $500 of the insurance money was paid into court by Hogueland. The clerk gave a receipt reciting, 'the same being in part payment of the redemption in the above-entitled cause.' On the next day this sum was withdrawn by Holmes, and, as he claims, remitted to Hess. On March 31, 1911, Hogueland delivered a draft for remainder of insurance money to Holmes, who claims that he remitted proceeds to Hess. Conway paid into court $738.03, July 15, 1912, which, with the $1,075 above referred to, made up amount necessary to redeem property sold by sheriff, and the clerk gave him a redemption receipt.\n Exactly when Holmes began to represent Harder is not clear,-certainly it was not later than June 1, 1911. In August, 1912, Holmes, as counsel, entered a motion for an order directing the sheriff to convey to Harder the land theretofore sold. Conway resisted, claiming that, by paying the necessary sum, he had redeemed the property. Solution of the issue presented depended upon professional conduct of Holmes, and his affidavits were put in evidence. The motion was denied; but a rehearing was granted and took place in February, 1913. Additional proofs, including two more of his own affidavits, were offered by Holmes, then present in court, and taken under consideration. April 30, 1913, Holmes still being present, the court denied motion for instruction to sheriff, and further 'ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the plaintiff, A. E. \n\n[241 U.S. 624, 628]\n\u00a0\n Hess, and S. C. Holmes, his attorney of record, within thirty days from this date, . . . return to and deposit in the office of the clerk of this court, the sum of One Thousand and Seventy-five ($1,075) Dollars, together with interest . . . down to the day such sum is paid into the office of the clerk of this court . . . to be used in the redemption and cancelation of certificate of purchase issued by the sheriff of Woodson county, Kansas, to A. E. Hess, plaintiff herein.'\n Without suggesting to the trial court that he had been surprised or prejudiced because no formal notice had been served upon him, or that he wished the order set aside, or desired to present additional proof, or take any further action whatsoever, and when the thirty days were about to expire, Holmes entered appeals to the supreme court of the state for himself and Harder; and on very general assignments of errors, making no mention of Federal right, the controversy was there again presented and considered upon its merits.\n Among other things the supreme court said (92 Kan. 787, L.R.A.--, --, 142 Pac. 253):\n'On the eve of the sheriff's sale, Holmes and Hogueland, as attorneys for their respective clients, agreed that the insurance money should be applied to the redemption of the land. Hess purchased at the sheriff's sale subject to this condition, and when he assigned the certificate of purchase, he and Holmes knew that the insurance money would go to redeem the land, and not to satisfy the excess judgment. This is the turning point in the case. Mr. Holmes claims he understood the agreement with Mr. Hogueland differently. After carefully considering all the strong arguments for his view, this court, as already stated, feels that the trial court was best able to determine the matter. The result is that Holmes could draw the first payment of insurance money from the clerk of the court, who had received and receipted for it for redemption \n\n[241 U.S. 624, 629]\n\u00a0\n purposes, for the benefit of no one but the holder of the certificate of purchase, who at that time was Harder; and Holmes received the proceeds of the draft for the second instalment of insurance money for the benefit of Harder. Soon afterwards, Holmes is found in court, engaged in the protection of Harder's interests as a holder of the certificate of purchase. Holmes had complete knowledge of all the facts relating to the insurance money. Harder's son and agent, F. H. Harder, was informed that Holmes had received $1,075 to apply in redemption of the premises, and Harder himself is noncommittal on the subject of his knowledge.\n\n ... * *\n'On February 24, 1911, Conway, through his attorney, paid to the clerk of the district court the sum of $500 as redemption money, and took the clerk's receipt accordingly. Holmes could rightfully withdraw this money for no purpose unless to pay it to Harder. The draft for $575, which he cashed, was redemption money also, and, if not paid to Harder, ought to be in the hands of the clerk. It is conceded that Harder received none of the money. The order, therefore, is a summary one, made by the court in a pending proceeding, to secure restoration to the treasury of the court of moneys arising from the litigation which the attorney has diverted.\n\n ... * *\n'In the present case the court was acting in its own behalf to secure the return of money belonging in its own custody. By motion directed against the sheriff, filed for his client, Harder, the attorney himself instituted the investigation of his professional conduct. That was the only substantial issue in the case, and he was fully heard, both as a witness and as an attorney, in justification of his course. The evidence which justifies the denial of an order against the sheriff justifies the order against him.' \n\n[241 U.S. 624, 630]\n\u00a0\n A petition for rehearing was presented and considered by the supreme court. Therein for the first time Holmes set up a claim under the 14th Amendment. In its opinion denying application, the court said (93 Kan. 246, L.R.A.--, --, 144 Pac. 205):\n\n'Holmes still insists that the order upon him to restore to the clerk [ of the court] the redemption money which came into his possession was irregular for informality of procedure. The form of procedure in summary disciplinary proceedings is not controlling so long as the essentials of fairnotice and opportunity to be heard are present. In this case Harder's right to a deed depended upon what his attorney's professional conduct had been. That was the primary issue tendered by the motion to require the sheriff to make a deed, and the attorney himself filed the motion and brought on the investigation. A trial was had in which all the facts were developed, Holmes and Hogueland gave their versions of the agreement with respect to the application of the insurance money. The money was traced, step by step, from the insurance company through Holmes to Hess. Holmes was necessarily compelled to describe and to defend his conduct, and did so by his own testimony and by other evidence which he adduced. The result was that in legal effect he stood before the court as one of its officers who had diverted from its treasury funds arising from the litigation. Then the attorney asked for another hearing, which was granted. While on the face of the record he appeared as the attorney for Harder, the substance of the issue still was what the character of his professional conduct had been. The nature of the charge against him had been fully disclosed at the first trial. It appeared in detail and in writing in the affidavits filed in the case. It was that charge which he knew he must meet at the second trial, which he had secured. He had from August of one year to February of the next year in which to prepare. To say that he did not \n\n[241 U.S. 624, 631]\n\u00a0\n make due preparation would be to impute to him unfaithfulness to Harder. He had command of the case, took such testimony from his former client, Hess, as he desired, and presented such other evidence as he desired, including additional affidavits of his own. At the final trial he was given full opportunity to defend in his own way and to an extent satisfactory to himself. Consequently every requirement of due process of law has been satisfied, and the court was not called upon to go through the ceremonious performance of instituting and prosecuting another proceeding, for the sake of stating the charges, giving notice, and having a hearing, before entering the disciplinary order.'\n\n The sole question presented for our determination is whether plaintiff in error has been deprived of a Federal right.\n Considering Holmes's position as an officer of the court, and patient hearings accorded him, his own testimony, and duty to offer in evidence whatever was obtainable and material, his actual presence at every stage of the proceedings, his failure to suggest surprise or desire for any further hearing, the inquiry touching his conduct, pending for many months, his perfect acquaintance with all the unusual circumstances, including his own liability, and looking at the substance, and not mere form, of things, we are unable to say that he has been deprived of adequate notice or fair opportunity to defend, and thereby denied due process of law. The cause undoubtedly presents difficulties not to be ignored; and our conclusion is restricted to the peculiar circumstances before us.\n In Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Schmidt, \n177 \nU.S. 230, 236\n, 44 S. L. ed. 747, 750, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 620, the principles applicable here are announced and applied. 'It is no longer open to contention that the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States does not control mere forms of procedure in state courts, or regulate practice therein. All its \n\n[241 U.S. 624, 632]\n\u00a0\n requirements are complied with, provided in the proceedings which are claimed not to have been due process of law the person condemned has had sufficient notice, and adequate opportunity has been afforded him to defend.'\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice Pitney dissents. \n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOME BOND CO. v. MCCHESNEY(1916)\nNo. 90\nArgued: December 3, 1915Decided: January 10, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 568, 569]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert Kinkead, S. M. Sapinsky, James R. Duffin, Owen D. Duffin, and S. M. Stockslager for appellant.\n Messrs. Lewis A. Nuckols, John Bryce Baskin, and Eli H. Brown, Jr., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n The New England Chair Company, and its successor, the American Fibre Reed Company, are Kentucky corporations which were engaged in business at Frankfort, in that state. On February 1, 1912, involuntary petitions in bankruptcy were filed against both companies, and they were duly adjudicated bankrupts. The two cases in bankruptcy were consolidated and directed to proceed as one cause, and the estates are under administration as one estate. The present appellant, the Home Bond Company, an Indiana corporation, filed intervening petitions, claiming certain funds in the hands of the trustee, obtained by him through the collection of accounts receivable of the bankrupt corporations, to which the petitioner claimed title under two contracts in writing made between it and the respective corporations; one with the New England Chair Company under date March 6, 1911, the other with the American Fibre Reed Company under date November 9, 1911, after the latter had taken over the assets and assumed the liabilities of the Chair Company. These agreements are identical in form, and a copy of one is set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[239 U.S. 568, 570]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner also set up a claim against the trustee for the sum of $ 800, being $100 per month from March 16 to October 12, 1912, inclusive, paid by it to one Manning, \n\n[239 U.S. 568, 571]\n\u00a0\n who, in the 6th clause of the contract of November 9, 1911, was by the Reed Company appointed attorney in fact to receive remittances in payment of the accounts \n\n[239 U.S. 568, 572]\n\u00a0\n receivable and transmit them to petitioner. It was averred that $100 per month was a reasonable charge, and that, under the provisions of the 6th clause, the Reed Company was to pay Manning, but failed to do so, and petitioner was compelled to make such payment.\n The trustee filed answers contesting the principal claim on the ground that the transactions between petitioner and the bankrupt corporations did not amount to a purchase of the accounts receivable, but constituted mere loans of money (with the accounts assigned as collateral \n\n[239 U.S. 568, 573]\n\u00a0\n security) at usurious rates of interest; and traversing the claim for moneys paid to Manning upon grounds that will appear below. The special master to whom the matter was referred overruled the claim, sustaining the trustee's contention, and holding, in view of the agreed statement of facts submitted to him by the parties in lieu of proof, that the contracts were not sales of the accounts by the respective bankrupt corporations to petitioner, but were transfers of the accounts as security for loans; and that these loans were made at usurious rates of interest, whether the contracts were made in Indiana or Kentucky, since the amounts retained as a 'service charge' under the contracts amounted to at least 24 per centum per annum on the moneys paid by the petitioner from the time of payment to the time of reimbursement, while the statutes of both states fixed 6 per centum per annum as the legal rate of interest, providing that any excess might be relieved against, and, if paid, recouped, and while the Indiana statute permitted interest up to 8 per cent to be contracted for in writing, it provided that if over 8 per cent were contracted for or collected, all over 6 per cent should be forfeited. The special master therefore held that in the settlement the transactions between the petitioner and trustee should be purged of usury, and the petitioner be treated as a creditor of the bankrupt corporations with security for its debt. As to the claim for the $800 paid by petitioner to Manning, the special master overruled this upon the ground that there was nothing to show what services, if any, were rendered by Manning as attorney in fact during the time from March 16, 1912, to November 12, 1912. It appeared that during the continuance of the contracts be tween the petitioner and the Chair Company and the Reed Company respectively, Manning was an officer and employee of the respective companies; that for all services rendered by him while so employed by these companies, including such as he \n\n[239 U.S. 568, 574]\n\u00a0\n rendered as attorney in fact, he was to receive a regular salary, which was paid to him by the Chair Company until the business was taken over by the Reed Company, and then by it until April 9, 1912, when the custodian took charge of the bankrupts' estates, with the exception of salary for the two weeks ending April 9, which was owing to him from the Reed Company; that from April 9 to September 9, 1912, Manning was in the employ of the custodian as clerk, and thereafter in the employ of the trustee in the same capacity, and his salary for this employment had been paid him out of the bankrupts' estates. The special master also overruled a claim made by petitioner for allowance of its counsel fee in the same proceedings. The demand for such allowance was based upon the 8th clause of the agreement, which it was contended was broad enough to embrace not only counsel fees incurred in the collection of accounts receivable from delinquent debtors or customers of the Chair Company or the Reed Company, but also counsel fees incurred by petitioner in collecting directly from either of those companies any accounts receivable which had come into its hands and for which it or its trustee in bankruptcy failed to account.\n Thereupon the special master stated an account between the petitioner and the bankrupts' estates, making the proper allowances for the usury, finding a balance of only $576.10 due from the trustee to the petitioner, and recommending that this be ordered paid over, but only upon condition that the petitioner turn over or account to the trustee for the contracts of March 6, 1911, and November 9, 1911, and any uncollected accounts, or papers connected with the uncollected accounts, delivered to it under those contracts.\n Petitioners' exceptions to this report were overruled by the district court (206 Fed. 309), and a decree was entered in accordance with the recommendations of \n\n[239 U.S. 568, 575]\n\u00a0\n the special master. The circuit court of appeals affirmed the decree. 127 C. C. A. 552, 210 Fed. 893.\n Upon the present appeal it is insisted that there was error in holding that petitioner and appellant, by virtue of the contracts between it and the bankrupts and the transactions and conduct of the parties did not become the purchaser or owner of the accounts receivable in question, and that the transactions were really loans, with the accounts receivable transferred as collateral security. But it seems to us so entirely clear that the conclusions reached by the special master and approved by both courts were correct that we deem it unnecessary to discuss the matter at any length. To quote from the opinion of the district court: 'The considerations which support this conclusion are that the bankrupts were to and did collect the accounts and bear all expenses in connection with their collection; what is claimed to have been the purchase price for the accounts, to wit, the difference between the face of the accounts and the discount, was not known until payment of the account and receipt thereof by the company, and then depended on the time that had elapsed since the date of the advance of the 75 per cent; what is claimed to have been deferred payment of the purchase price was simply a return to the bankrupt of the excess of the collection over and above the advance and discount; and the provision that, in the event of nonpayment of any of the accounts at maturity, or the debtor becoming insolvent, the bankrupt should repurchase the account and pay therefor the advance made thereupon, plus the discount. . . . In so far as the contracts in question here use words fit for a contract of purchase, they are mere shams and devices to cover loans of money at usurious rates of interest. That the company was not adverse to the use of shams is otherwise apparent from the use by it of the word 'service,' in its dealings with the bankrupts under the con- \n\n[239 U.S. 568, 576]\n\u00a0\n tracts, to characterize the discounts. In any view of the contracts those discounts were not charges for services rendered the bankrupts. Loans are never regarded as services.'\n Houghton v. Burden, \n228 U.S. 161\n, 57 L. ed. 780, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 491, affirming Re Canfield, 113 C. C. A. 562, 193 Fed. 934, is plainly distinguishable, for there the contract contemplated actual services by the lender, and this provision was found not to have been a mere cover for usury.\n The rulings adverse to the claim for moneys paid to Manning and for counsel fees in the proceedings are so manifestly correct as to require no discussion.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This agreement, made this 6th day of March, 1911, at Indianapolis, Indiana, by and between New England Chair Company, hereinafter called first party, and the Home Bond Company, hereinafter called second party.\n Witnesseth, that, for one dollar ($1) and other good and valuable \n considerations, each to the other paid, receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto have agreed and do hereby agree as follows:\n First.

Immediately after the purchase of every account hereunder, said first party shall make upon its book an entry showing the absolute sale of said accounts to said second party, and said second party is hereby given the right and privilege of auditing the books, accounts and records of said first party, relating to said accounts, at any time that it may see fit so to do.\n Sixth. Whereas it is for the mutual benefit of the parties hereto that the collection of said accounts shall in the first instance be remitted to the party of the first part and in its name; the party of the first part shall at all times appoint some person or persons mutually acceptable to both of the parties hereto, their attorney in fact to receive all such remittances in whatever form they may be made, and to transfer, assign and transmit all such proceeds to said party of the second part.\n And said party of the first part sall immediately upon receipt of such remittances in whatever form the same shall be made, deliver the same to such attorney for transmittal to the party of the second part; and said attorney shall at all times have access to all mail received by said party of the first part and all books and records of the party of the first part, to discover what payments and remittances are made upon such accounts.\n And in consideration of the execution of this agreement by the party of the second part, said party of the first part undertakes and agrees to guarantee the faithful conduct of said attorney in fact in the receipt, assignment and transmittal of all such payments or remittances. And upon the like consideration said party of the first part shall pay unto said attorney in fact compensation for all such services so rendered in that behalf; and that we will furnish and provide for said attorney in fact all necessary clerical or stenographic assistance for making reports \n to party of the first part, and all postage or express charges for transmitting reports and remittances; said attorney in fact shall also have the right and power, and it shall be his duty to indorse the name of the party of the first part on any freight or express bill or bill of lading relating to said accounts; and ratifying and confirming all its said attorney may do in the premises. And said attorney in fact as to all such matters shall receive such moneys or other remittance solely for the party of the second part and shall at all times be subject to its exclusive orders with relation thereto; and it is now mutually agreed between the parties hereto that E. Manning shall be and continue such attorney in fact to perform such duties, until by mutual agreement of the parties hereto, another person shall be appointed in his stead.\n Seventh. That said second party in making purchase of accounts hereunder relies upon the guaranties and covenants of said first party herein contained and upon the written representations made to it by said first party as to the financial responsibility of said first party; that said written representation heretofore made and that may hereafter be made are for the purpose of establishing the credit of said first party with said second party so that sale of accounts may be made hereunder.\n Eight. That said first party shall execute and deliver to said second party or its assigns, any document necessary or proper to carry into effect this contract and should second party employ counsel or cause legal action to be instituted to enforce the payment of any of said accounts, or any part thereof, either in its own name or of the name of the party of the first part, then and in either case said first party shall immediately pay to said second party or its assigns, all court costs, expenses, attorney's and stenorgrapher's fees which may be by it expended in such proceedings.\n In witness whereof, etc. \n\n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHUTCHINSON ICE CREAM COMPANY v.

Parrish and Walter Jeffreys Carlin for plaintiffs in error in No. 40.\n\n\n[242 U.S. 153, 155]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George Cosson, Attorney General of Iowa, for defendant in error in no. 40.\n Mr. William M. Hargest and Mr. Francis Shunk Brown, Attorney General of Pennsylvania, for defendant in error in No. 50. \n\n[242 U.S. 153, 156]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Brandeis delivered the opinion of the court:\n These cases were argued together. In each a state statute which prohibits the sale of ice cream containing less than a fixed percentage of butter fat is assailed as invalid under the 14th Amendment; the supreme court of each state having held its statute constitutional. State v. Hutchinson Ice Cream Co. 168 Iowa, 1, L.R.A. 1917B, 198, 147 N. W. 195; Com. v. Crowl, 245 Pa. 554, 91 Atl. 922. Iowa makes 12 per cent the required minimum; Pennsylvania 8 per cent. The material provisions of the several statutes are copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[242 U.S. 153, 157]\n\u00a0\n The right of the state under the police power to regulate the sale of products with a view to preventing frauds or protecting the public health is conceded by plaintiffs in error. And they do not contend that the particular percentages of butter fat set by Iowa and Pennsylvania are so exacting as to be in themselves unreasonable. Thirteen other states have by similar legislation set 14 per cent as the minimum; five other states 12 per cent; only eight states have fixed a percentage as low as Pennsylvania; and \n\n[242 U.S. 153, 158]\n\u00a0\n the United States Department of Agriculture has declared 14 per cent to be standard. \n2\n The main objection urged is this: To require that ice cream, in order to be legally salable, must contain some butter fat, is a regulation so unreasonable and arbitrary as to be a deprivation of property without due process of law and a denial of the equal protection of the laws. To support this contention the following trade facts are shown:\n The ice cream of commerce is not iced or frozen cream. It is a frozen confection-a compound. The ingredients of this compound may vary widely in character, in the number used, and in the proportions in which they are used. These variations are dependent upon the ingenuity, skill, and judgment of the maker, the relative cost at a particular time or at a particular place of the possible ingredients, and the requirements of the market in respect to taste or selling price. Thus, some Philadelphia ice cream is made of only cream, sugar, and a vanilla flavor. In making other Philadelphia ice cream the whites of eggs are added; and according to some formulas vanilla ice cream may be made without any cream or milk whatsoever; for instance, by proper manipulation of the yolks of eggs, the whites of eggs, sugar, syrup, and the vanilla bean. All of these different compounds are commonly sold as ice cream; and none of them is necessarily unwholesome.\n Plaintiffs in error contend that as ice cream is shown to be a generic term embracing a large number and variety of products, and the term as used does not necessarily imply the use of dairy cream in its composition, it is arbitrary and unreasonable to limit the ice cream of commerce to that containing a fixed minimum of butter fat. But the legislature may well have found in these facts persuasive \n\n[242 U.S. 153, 159]\n\u00a0\n evidence that the public welfare required the prohibition enacted. The facts show that, in the absence of legislative regulation, the ordinary purchaser at retail does not and cannot know exactly what he is getting when he purchases ice cream. He presumably believes that cream or at least rich milk is among the important ingredients; and he may make his purchase with a knowledge that butter fat is the principal food value in cream or milk. Laws designed to prevent persons from being misled in respect to the weight, measurement, quality, or ingredients of an article of general consumption are a common exercise of the police power. The legislature defines the standard article or fixes some of its characteristics; and it may conclude that fraud or mistake can be effectively prevented only by prohibiting the sale of the article under the usual tradename, if it fails to meet the requirements of the standard set. Laws prohibiting the sale of milk or cream containing less than fixed percentages of butter fat present a familiar instance of such legislation. Cases in the state courts upholding laws of this character are referred to in the margin. \n3\n This court has repeatedly sustained the validity of similar prohibitions. Schmidinger v. Chicago, \n226 U.S. 578\n, 57 L. ed. 364,33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 284; Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, \n240 U.S. 510\n, 60 L. ed. 771, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 440, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 548.\n It is specially urged that the statutes are unconstitutional because they do not merely define the term 'ice cream;' but arbitrarily prohibit the sale of a large variety of wholesome compounds theretofore included under the name 'ice cream.' The acts appear to us merely to prohibit the sale of such compounds as ice cream. Such is the construction given to the act by the supreme court of Iowa. \n\n[242 U.S. 153, 160]\n\u00a0\n State v. Hutchinson Ice Cream Co. 168 Iowa, 1, 15, L.R.A. 1917B, 198, 147 N. W. 195, which is, of course, binding on us. We cannot assume, in the absence of a definite and authoritative ruling, that the supreme court of Pennsylvania would construe the law of that state otherwise. The conviction here under review was for selling the 'compound' as ice cream, so that we are not called upon to determine whether the state may, in the exercise of its police power, prohibit the sale even of a wholesome product, if the public welfare appear to require such action-and if, as here, interstate commerce is not involved. See Powell v. Pennsylvania, \n127 \nU.S. 678, 685\n, 32 S. L. ed. 253, 256, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 992, 1257; Schollenberger v. Pennsylvania, \n171 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 43 S. L. ed. 49, 54, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 757.\n In view of the conclusion stated above, it is unnecessary to consider whether the statutes are or are not sustainable as health measures; and upon this we express no opinion.\n The judgment in each case is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Iowa: Code Supp. 1913,  4999-a20:\n'No person, firm or corporation, . . . shall manufacture or introduce into the state, or solicit or take orders for delivery, or sell, exchange, deliver or have in his possession with the intent to sell, exchange or expose or offer for sale or exchange, any article of food which is adulterated or misbranded, within the meaning of this act.'\n\n Code Supp. 1913,  4999-a31e:\n'For the purpose of this act an article of food shall be deemed to be adulterated:\n\n'First.

MESSINA(1916)\nNo. 535\nArgued: February 23, 1916Decided: March 6, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. R. V. Fletcher, Blewett Lee, and Edward Mayes for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[240 U.S. 395, 396]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Harry Peyton and William H. Watkins for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action for personal injuries suffered by the defendant in error while upon a train running from Mississippi to Tennessee. He had paid no fare, but was upon the tender, as he said, by permission of the engineer. The engineer had notice that the water was high between Beatty and Sawyer and over the track at Sawyer. After passing Beatty the train was going at a rate variously put as 35 to 50 or 60 miles an hour when it ran into the water and was thrown from the track. The plaintiff was caught between the tender and a car and badly hurt.\n The plaintiff got a judgment for $10,000, which was sustained by the supreme court. At the trial the jury were instructed that the defendant railroad was presumed to be negligent, and that if the evidence left it doubtful, it was their duty to find full damages for the plaintiff. The judge refused to instruct them that the engineer had no authority to permit the plaintiff to ride on the train 'at the place he was in,' but the request for this instruction was based upon the company's rules, not upon the act to regulate commerce. The supreme court, however, discussed the act of Congress and held that it did not apply to the case.\n By  1 of the act, as amended by the act of June 29, 1906, chap. 3591, 34 Stat. at L. 584, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563, and still in force, any common carrier violating the provisions against free transportation is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a penalty, and any person other than those excepted 'who uses any such interstate . . . free transportation' is made subject to a like penalty. No doubt the enactment had somewhat more formal \n\n[240 U.S. 395, 397]\n\u00a0\n uses especially in view, but we see no reason for limiting the prohibition to them. The word 'such' like 'said' seems to us to indicate no more than that free transportation had been mentioned before. We cannot think that if a prominent merchant or official should board a train and by assumption and an air of importance should obtain free carriage, he would escape the act. We are of opinion therefore that the act was construed wrongly. Assuming, as it has been assumed, that the defendant's liability was governed otherwise by state law, it seems doubtful under the state decisions whether the plaintiff would have been allowed to recover had the court been of opinion that the act of Congress made his presence on the train illegal. Western U. Teleg. Co. v. McLaurin, -- Miss. --, L.R.A.1915C, 487, 66 So. 739. And although there are expressions in the opinion below that raise a doubt, the fact that the supreme court thought it necessary to construe the act indicates that the construction was material to the result. For this reason the judgment must be reversed.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes, dissenting:\n The supreme court of the state held that the provision of the Federal act was not applicable to this case, and I think that the court was right. Congress did not concern itself with the possibility that prominent persons, or others, might steal a ride through the unauthorized action of some employee of the railroad company. Congress was concerned with the well-known abuse which consisted in the giving of passes, or free transportation, by railroad companies, and it directed its legislation to that abuse. The provision is: 'No common carrier subject to the provisions of this act shall, . . . directly or indirectly, issue or give any interstate free ticket, free pass or free transportation for passengers,' except as stated; and \n\n[240 U.S. 395, 398]\n\u00a0\n that 'any common carrier violating this provision shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and for each offense, on conviction shall pay . . . a penalty . . . and any person, other than the persons excepted in this provision, who uses any such interstate free ticket, free pass, or free transportation shall be subject to a like penality.' [34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563.] Here, it was found that the engineer had no authority to give any free transportation to the plaintiff, and I cannot but think that in this view the defendant in error was outside the act. The supreme court of the state said: 'The common carrier did not issue any free transportation to this plaintiff, and he was not using any such free transportation. The engineer in charge of the locomotive pulling a passenger train under no conceivable circumstances has any power to issue free transportation to any person, and we are unable to see the force of the argument along this line. . . . It is clear to us that the engineer was not authorized to carry plaintiff free, and it is also manifest that the act of Congress is not directed against acts of the character here involved. [-- Miss. --, 67 So. 966.]\n I know of no reason for disregarding the finding of the state court as to want of authority in the engineer, and it was on this hypothesis that the court held the Federal provision to be inapplicable. Aside from this ruling, it is not suggested that any Federal question is involved.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice McKenna concurs in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nILLINOIS CENT. R. CO. v. PEERY(1916)\nNo. 77\nArgued: Decided: December 18, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. Blewett Lee and W. S. Horton for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Samuel A. Anderson for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act to recover for personal injuries caused by a rear end collision in Kentucky. The railroad company denied that the case was governed by the Federal act, contending that the train upon which the plaintiff was moving was engaged in local business only, between two \n\n[242 U.S. 292, 293]\n\u00a0\n points within the state. The issue was important as affecting the rules of law to be applied. At a second trial the judge, intending to follow the previous decision of the supreme court of the state (123 Minn. 264, 143 N. W. 724), ruled that the accident happened in interstate commerce, and that the act of Congress governed the case. The defendant excepted and assigned as error that the court determined the matter of fact instead of leaving it to the jury, in accordance with the intimation of the former decision ( 123 Minn. 266), but the judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state (128 Minn. 119, 150 N. W. 382).\n We are of opinion that the ruling was wrong, as, we think, will be seen from a short statement of the facts. The plaintiff was a freight conductor on the defendant's road, having his principal run from Paducah, south, to Fulton, both in Kentucky, and the same day back from Fulton, north, to Paducah. According to his testimony he took back the engine, caboose, and crew with which he started, and was allowed 100 miles of mileage in compensation for the trip out and back. The train out generally and on this occasion had freight destined to beyond the limits of the state. That on the return depended on what could be picked up, the engine and caboose sometimes coming back alone. The accident happened when the engine was returning to Paducah, after having taken up a switch engine from the Fulton yards seemingly in need of repairs at the Paducah shops, and a pile driver and outfit on three flat cars, and having in the rear, behind the last, the plaintiff's caboose. The pile driver was dropped on the way, at Mayfield, and the train thereafter consisted of the two engines and the caboose. The plaintiff was sitting in the caboose, making up a report of his trip out and back, when the collision occurred.\n Of course the plaintiff treats the round trip as one, and the return as merely the necessary complement of the trip out. The conclusion is drawn that the plaintiff still \n\n[242 U.S. 292, 294]\n\u00a0\n was engaged in interstate commerce because the train out had cars destined to Tennessee. But, on the other hand, the trips out and back were distinct, in opposite directions, with different trains. The plaintiff's journey was confined wholly to Kentucky. Only the circumstance that the south-bound train from Paducah carried freight destined to beyond Fulton caused him to be engaged in interstate commerce while on that trip. On the return, when he was injured, all the freight had domestic destinations. It is true that the greater certainty of getting traffic going south probably was the chief reason for the establishment of the circuit; but they got what they could coming back; generally a train or a part of a train. It seems to us extravagant to subordinate the northerly to the southerly journey so completely that if, on the latter, there happened to be a parcel destined beyond the state, the conductor should be regarded as still engaged in commerce among the states when going from Fulton to Paducah, even though he had a full train devoted solely to domestic commerce. For it must be remembered that if the northerly movement is regarded as the incident of the southerly, that subordination is independent of the character of the commerce, and depends solely on the fact that southerly moving business, no matter what, induced establishing the route. Therefore it does not matter that the interstate traffic moving south was greater than, for purposes of illustration, we have supposed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nILLINOIS CENT. R. CO. v. SKAGGS(1916)\nNo. 194\nArgued: Decided: January 31, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 66, 67]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. S. Horton and Blewett Lee for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Humphrey Barton and John H. Kay for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is writ of error to review a judgment recovered under the Federal employers' liability act. There is no question but that the defendant in error, Fulton M. Skaggs, was injured while he was engaged in interstate commerce in the course of his employment by the plaintiff in error. It is contended that the state court erred in its application of the statute to the facts, both with respect to the conditions of liability and the measure of damages.\n Skaggs had been employed by the company for about four years, first in connection with the building and repair of bridges, and then, for about two years, as a locomotive fireman. A few days before the accident he began work as a brakeman on a freight train, his first run being from Freeport to Clinton, Illinois, on January 10, 1913. It was on the return trip to Freeport, on January 13, 1913, that he was injured. The crew consisted of the conductor, the engineer, the fireman, the rear brakeman, named Buchta, \n\n[240 U.S. 66, 68]\n\u00a0\n and Skaggs, who was head (or forward) brakeman. There was evidence that Buchta was assigned to the position of rear brakeman because of his greater experience. The train reached Amboy, an intermediate station, about 2 o'clock A. M. It was a dark, cold night. There were fifteen cars in the train, two of which were to be left at Amboy. The train was cut immediately behind these two cars; the engine with the forward string of cars proceeded northward on the main track to a point beyond a switch connecting with a passing track to the west; and the two cars were then pushed back on the passing track and cut off. The engine, with the remaining cars, then returned to the main track and backed down in the direction of the cars which had been left standing on the track. After backing a short distance, the engine was stopped, was uncoupled, and was moved forward alone across the switch leading to the passing track, the purpose being to return to the passing track and from thence to proceed to a further track to the west, in order to pick up certain other cars which were to be put into the train. There had not been left, however, a safe clearance for the engine, and, when the engine backed to the passing track, Skaggs, who was riding on the right side at the rear of the tender, was hit by the end of the foremost car left on the main track, was knocked to the ground, and was run over, this being the injury of which he complains.\n While there is little or no dispute as to these facts, there is a conflict of testimony as to the relation of Buchta, the other brakeman, to the occurrence. Omitting various details of the movements which, for the present purpose, need not be considered, and taking the testimony of Skaggs, which the jury was at liberty to believe, these facts appear: When, after leaving the two cars on the passing track, the engine, with the remaining string of cars, returned to the main track and backed down, Skaggs gave the signal to stop, repeating a signal which was received, as he \n\n[240 U.S. 66, 69]\n\u00a0\n supposed, from the conductor. At that time Buchta was somewhere in the yard (he had been lining up switches for the intended movements), but Skaggs did not see him when the cars were stopped. Skaggs then went to the depot to ascertain the meaning of the signal, and was told by the conductor that it was necessary to pick up certain other cars. Returning to the engine, he attempted to uncouple it from the right-hand side, but found this difficult, and Buchta, who was then on the opposite side, effected the uncoupling and said, 'Go ahead.' On Skaggs's signal, the engine started forward; but Skaggs did not know whether the cars were left so as to give sufficient clearance for an engine going onto the passing track, and asked Buchta as to this. He did not receive a satisfactory answer; he stopped the engine, got off, and again asked Buchta, who replied: 'They are clear a mile, go ahead, and if we don't get out of here the sixteen-hour law will catch us before we get into Freeport.' Skaggs at that time was on the track at the rear of the tender and not more than a car's length from the standing car. He then got on the engine, rode up to the switch, through the switch, gave the back-up signal, stepped on the corner of the tender and was looking back for any signal that might be given by the other brakeman when he was caught between the rear right-hand side of the tender and the end of the standing car, as already stated.\n It is contended that the state court erred in permitting a recovery under the Federal statute for the reason that the injury resulted from Skaggs's own act, or from an act in which he participated. The company, it is said, 'cannot be negligent to an employee whose failure of duty and neglect produced the dangerous condition.' It may be taken for granted that the statute does not contemplate a recovery by an employee for the consequences of action exclusively his own; that is, where his injury does not result in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of the employing carrier, or \n\n[240 U.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its property or equipment. 35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657. But, on the other hand, it cannot be said that there can be no recovery simply because the injured employee participated in the act which caused the injury. The inquiry must be whether there is neglect on the part of the employing carrier, and, if the injury to one employee resulted 'in whole or in part' from the negligence of any of its other employees, it is liable under the express terms of the act. That is, the statute abolished the fellow-servant rule. If the injury was due to the neglect of a co-employee in the performance of his duty, that neglect must be attributed to the employer; and if the injured employee was himself guilty of negligence contributing to the injury, the statute expressly provides that it 'shall not bar a recovery, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee.' See Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N. H . & H. R. Co.) \n223 \nU.S. 1, 49\n, 50 S., 56 L. ed. 327, 345, 346, 38 L.R.A.(N.S .) 44, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169, 1 N. C. C. A. 875; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Tilghman, \n237 \nU.S. 499, 501\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1069, 1070, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 653. We think that the argument for the plaintiff in error overlooks the inferences of fact which the jury was entitled to draw. Thus, the jury could properly regard the two brakemen as assisting each other in the movement in question. Such assistance was certainly appropriate, if not absolutely necessary. The very purpose of having two brakemen was not to put upon either the entire responsibility. Working together under the exigencies of such operations, particularly when conducted in the nighttime, it was manifestly contemplated that the one brakeman would supplement the other, and not be compelled, at the peril of his rights, personally to examine what the other did, or the basis of the reports the other gave. Each had a reasonable latitude in relying upon the statements of the other, made in the course of the operation and as a part of it. The supreme court of the state said: 'It was \n\n[240 U.S. 66, 71]\n\u00a0\n a very dark night, and evidently there was necessity for haste. If plaintiff's story is true, Buchta was in a position to know about clearance, while plaintiff was not; and we are unable to say plaintiff had not the right to rely upon his statement in regard thereto.' [124 Minn. 506, 145 N. W. 381.] In this we find no error. When the engine was uncoupled, Skaggs was on the right-hand side, while Buchta was on the other side,-the side of the passing track,-a better place to judge the clearance. The fact that Skaggs asked his questions is itself not without significance. These questions indicated doubt on Skaggs's part, while Buchta's reply showed certainty on his. It was plainly permissible to infer from the testimony that the two men were not in positions of equal advantage, and Skaggs was entitled to the exercise of reasonable care on the part of Buchta in observing and reporting the position of the cars. As there was evidence upon which it could be found that Buchta was negligent, and that thereby injury resulted to Skaggs, it cannot be said that the recovery in this aspect of the case was contrary to the statute.\n But it is urged that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury. After stating that if any employee 'was, at the time of this accident, negligent in the performance of his duty, which negligence was the direct cause of the injury sustained by the plaintiff, then the defendant . . . would be liable for that negligence,' and after referring to the 'direct conflict of testimony' with respect to what was said and done by Buchta, the trial court charged as follows: 'Did the employee Buchta fail to exercise that ordinary and reasonable care which a prudent person would have exercised under the circumstances existing at that time? If he did fail to exercise such ordinary and reasonable care, then he would be guilty of negligence, and that negligence in this case would be the negligence of the defendant railway company. You must determine this question of fact from all of \n\n[240 U.S. 66, 72]\n\u00a0\n the testimony in the case.' It was added, in substance, that if Buchta did not fail to exercise reasonable care, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. It is contended that the trial court erred in failing to qualify the instruction quoted, and other statements to the same effect, by reference to what Skaggs himself did, knew, or was in a position to know. But in view of the state of the testimony, and the point to which the court's instruction was addressed, we cannot say that it was in itself erroneous. If the plaintiff in error desired any addition, amplification, or qualification in order to present its point of view to the jury, it should have made appropriate request therefor. The record does not show that the plaintiff in error either objected at the time to any statement made by the court to the jury, or that it made any request whatever for instructions. While under the local statute (Gen. Stat. [Minn.]  7830) the plaintiff in error was permitted (without taking exceptions at the trial) to specify upon a motion for a new trial alleged errors in the rulings or instructions of the trial court, we do not find that this statute alters the salutary rule that a party is not entitled to sit silent until after the verdict and then insist that it shall be set aside because of a failure on the part of the trial court particularly to specify in its charge some matter to which its attention had not been suitably called. State v. Zempel, 103 Minn. 428, 429, 115 N. W. 275; Waligora v. St. Paul Foundry Co. 107 Minn. 554, 559, 119 N. W. 395; Sassen v. Haegle, 125 Minn. 441, 52 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1176, 147 N. W. 445; State v. Sailor, 130 Minn. 84, 153 N. W. 271; Smith v. Great Northern R. Co. -- Minn. --, 153 N. W. 513. This, also, is a sufficient answer to the complaint of the failure of the trial court to charge the jury with respect to assumption of risk. There was no request for any instruction upon this point. So far as these criticisms are concerned, we are unable to say that any asserted Federal right was denied by the state court. \n\n[240 U.S. 66, 73]\n\u00a0\n The remaining question is with respect to the instructions of the trial court on the subject of contributory negligence. In the course of these the court fell into the error of saying that, if Skaggs was negligent, 'a comparative amount, depending upon the ratio of his negligence to the negligence of the defendant, would be considered by you' ( the jury); and, again, that the jury should 'take into consideration his negligence in comparison with the negligence of the defendant.' But the court read the applicable provision of the statute to the jury and also said: 'The design of this statute seems to be to place the responsibility for negligence in all cases just where it belongs, and to make everybody who is responsible for negligence which produces injury or an accident responsible for that part of it and to the extent to which they contributed to it, and so the law provides that contributory negligence does not bar a recovery, but that the damages to which one is entitled are to be reduced in proportion as his own negligence contributed to bring about the injury. That is, in a case like this, if it should be found that both parties were to blame, that both were negligent, both the defendant and the plaintiff, then the defendant company is to be responsible to the extent to which it was to blame, and the plaintiff would be responsible himself to the extent to which he was to blame.' And no request was made for a correction of the first-mentioned parts of the charge. It was recognized by the supreme court of the state that those parts failed to conform to the correct interpretation of the statutory rule as defined in Norfolk & W. R. Co. v. Earnest, \n229 \nU.S. 114, 122\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1096, 1101, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 654, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 172, and the court quoted what we there said, as follows: 'But for the use in the second instance of the additional words 'as compared with the negligence of the defendant' there would be no room for criticism. Those words were not happily chosen, for to have reflected what the statute contemplates they should have read 'as compared \n\n[240 U.S. 66, 74]\n\u00a0\n with the combined negligence of himself and the defendant.' We say this because the statutory direction that the diminution shall be 'in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee' means, and can only mean, that, where the causal negligence is partly attributable to him and partly to the carrier, he shall not recover full damages, but only a proportional amount bearing the same relation to the full amount as the negligence attributable to the carrier bears to the entire negligence attributable to both. . . . Not improbably the mistake in the instruction was purely verbal and would have been promptly corrected had attention been specially called to it, and possibly it was not prejudicial to the defendant.'\n The state court concluded that 'upon the whole instruction no prejudice to defendant resulted.' And in this view we concur.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nILLINOIS SURETY CO. v. U S, TO USE OF PEELER(1916)\nNo. 176\nArgued: January 14, 1916Decided: February 21, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 214, 215]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Bynum E. Hinton for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Benjamin E. Pierce, D. W. Robinson, and John L. Rendleman for defendants in error.\n Messrs. George P. Miller, Edwin S. Mack, and Arthur W. Fairchild, as amici curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought by subcontractors under the act of August 13, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 278, chap. 280), as amended by the act of February 24, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 811, chap. 778, Comp. Stat. 1913,  6923), in the name of the United States, to recover upon a contractor's bond. The contract was for the construction of a postoffice building in Aiken, South Carolina (35 Stat. at L. 526, 528, chap. 228), and the Illinois Surety Company (plaintiff in error) was the surety. The summons and complaint were filed on March 4, 1913. Motion to dismiss was made on September 22, 1913, upon the ground that the complaint did not allege that there had been a completion and final settlement of the contract between the contractor and the United States; or that there had been such completion and settlement more than six months, and within one year, prior to the commencement of the action. \n\n[240 U.S. 214, 216]\n\u00a0\n Another ground for the motion was that the remedy under the statute was in equity. The motion was denied, the court permitting the complaint to be amended so as to allege that the contract was completed in July, 1912; that final settlement was made by the Treasury Department on August 21, 1912; and that no suit had been brought by the United States against the contractor and his surety within the six months' period. The defendant, reserving its objection to the order denying the motion and allowing the amendment, answered. Jury trial was waived by written stipulation and the case was heard by the district judge, who found, in substance, the facts to be as follows:\n That the building was completed, and on August 21, 1912, the Treasury Department 'stated and determined the final balance' to be paid the contractor under the contract at the sum of $3,999.01; that this 'adjustment and determination' was communicated to the contractor; that on August 26, 1912, a voucher of that date was prepared by the Department, showing the balance, as above stated, to which the contractor appended his signature, certifying the amount to be correct, and that on that day there was a definite acceptance by the contractor of the adjustment; that on September 11, 1912, a check for the above-mentioned sum was made out by the disbursing clerk of the Department, payable to the order of the contractor, who thereafter collected it; that upon the request of the relator (the Faith Granite Company) the Secretary of the Treasury, on January 16, 1913, furnished to it a certified copy of the contract and bond, and that on the 6th day of March, 1913, . . . the present action was instituted by the filing. . . . and by service of summons and complaint on defendant Surety Company.' It also appeared that no action had been instituted by the United States upon the bond within the six months allowed by the statute. \n\n[240 U.S. 214, 217]\n\u00a0\n The district court gave judgment for amounts found to be due to those for whose benefit the action was brought, and to certain interveners, and this judgment was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals, 131 C. C. A. 476, 215 Fed. 334. The contentions presented are: (1) That the action was instituted prematurely; (2) that the amendment of the complaint was improperly allowed; (3) that there was no right of action at law; and (4) that the court erred in giving judgment for the Carolina Electrical Company, one of the subcontractors.\n\n 1. \nThe statute provides: 'If no suit should be brought by the United States within six months from the completion and final settlement of said contract, then the person or persons supplying the contractor with labor and materials shall, upon application therefor, and furnishing affidavit . . . be furnished with a certified copy of said contract and bond, upon which he or they shall have a right of action, and shall be, and are hereby, authorized to bring suit in the name of the United States . . . against said contractor and his sureties, and to prosecute the same to final judgment and execution; Provided, That . . . it shall not be commenced until after the complete performance of said contract and final settlement thereof, and shall be commenced within one year after the performance and final settlement of said contract, and not later.' In United States ex rel. Texas Portland Cement Co. v. McCord,1 \n233 U.S. 157\n, 58 L. ed. 893, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 550, we said that this act created a new right of action upon terms named; and hence that an action brought by creditors before six months had expried from the time of the 'completion and final settlement of the contract' could not be sustained. In the present case, the plaintiff in error insists that there was no final settlement within the meaning of the statute prior to the issue of the check \n\n[240 U.S. 214, 218]\n\u00a0\n for payment to the contractor on September 11, 1912, and that in this view the action was brought too soon.\n It was evidently the purpose of the act of 1905 to remedy the defect in the act of 1894 by assuring to the United States adequate opportunity to enforce its demand against the contractor's surety, and priority with respect to such demand. Mankin v. United States, \n215 \nU.S. 533, 538\n, 54 S. L. ed. 315, 317, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174; United States ex rel. Brown-Ketcham Iron Works v. Robinson, 130 C. C. A. 432, 214 Fed. 38, 39, 40. Accordingly it was provided that if the United States sued upon the bond, the described creditors should be allowed to intervene, and be made parties to the action, but subject 'to the priority of the claim and judgment of the United States.' And it was only in case the United States did not sue within the specified period that the creditors could bring their action. With this object in view,-to protect the priority of the United States, and at the same time to give a remedy to materialmen and laborers on the contractor's bond and a reasonable time to prosecute it (United States use of Alexander Bryant Co. v. New York Steam Fitting Co. \n235 \nU.S. 327, 337\n, 59 S. L. ed. 253, 257, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 108),-it was natural that the time allowed exclusively for action by the government should begin to run when the contract had been completed, and the government, in its final adjustment and settlement according to established administrative methods, had determined what amount, if any, was due. Then the government would have ascertained the amount of its claim, if it had one, and could bring suit if it desired. As such determinations are regularly made in the course of administration, nothing would seem to be gained by postponing the date, from which to reckon the six months, to the time of payment. Indeed, if an amount were found to be due from the contractor, and he was insolvent, there might be no payment, and, if payment were essential, there would be no date from which the time for the bringing of the creditors' action could be computed.\n The pivotal words are not 'final payment,' but 'final \n\n[240 U.S. 214, 219]\n\u00a0\n settlement,' and in view of the significance of the latter term in administrative practice, it is hardly likely that it would have been used had it been intended to denote payment. See United States v. Illinois Surety Co. 195 Fed. 306, 309; United States use of Chief All Over v. Bailey, 207 Fed. 782, 784; United States ex rel. Brown-Ketcham Iron Works v. Robinson (C. C. A. 2d C.) supra; United States use of Starrett-Fields Co. v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. 215 Fed. 241, 244; United States use of John Davis Co. v. Illinois Surety Co. (C. C. A. 7th C.) 226 Fed. 653, 662. The word 'settlement,' in connection with public transactions and accounts, has been used from the beginning to describe administrative determination of the amount due. By the act of September 2, 1789, chap. 12 ( 1 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  235), establishing the Treasury Department, the Comptroller was charged with the duty of examining 'all accounts settled by the auditor.' ( 3.) And it was made the duty of the auditor to receive 'all public accounts and after examination to certify the balance,' subject to the provision that any person whose account should be so audited might appeal to the Comptroller 'against such settlement.' The act of March 3, 1809, chap. 28,  2 (2 Stat. at L. 536, Comp. Stat. 1913,  406), gave authority to the Comptroller to direct the auditor forthwith 'to audit and settle any particular account' which he was authorized to audit and settle, and 'to report such settlement' for his revision and final decision. (See Rev. Stat.  271.) By the act of March 3, 1817, chap. 45,  2) 3 Stat. at L. 366, Comp. Stat. 1913,  368), it was provided that 'all claims and demands whatever, by the United States or against them, and all accounts whatever, in which the United States are concerned, either as debtors or as creditors, shall be settled and adjusted in the Treasury Department.' This provision was carried into  236 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. Stat. 1913,  368). The words 'settled and adjusted' were taken to mean the determination in the Treasury Department for administrative purposes of the state of the account and the amount due. See 2 Ops. Atty. Gen. 518, 625, 629, 630. Referring \n\n[240 U.S. 214, 220]\n\u00a0\n to this provision, it was said by Mr. Chief Justice Waite, in delivering the opinion of the court in Cooke v. United States, \n91 \nU.S. 389, 399\n, 23 S. L. ed. 237, 243: 'Thus it is seen that all claims against the United States are to be settled and adjusted 'in the Treasury Department;' and that is located 'at the seat of government.' The assistant treasurer in New York is a custodian of the public money, which he may pay out or transfer upon the order of the proper department or officer; but he has no authority to settle and adjust, that is to say, to determine upon the validity of, any claim against the government. He can pay only after the adjustment has been made 'in the Treasury Department,' and then upon drafts drawn for that purpose by the treasurer.' Again, the act of July 31, 1894, chap. 174 (28 Stat. at L. 162, 206-208, Comp. Stat. 1913,  57, 425 ), relating to the examination of accounts by auditors, and revisions of accounts, etc., provides, in  8, that 'the balances which may from time to time be certified by the auditors to the Division of Bookkeeping and Warrants or to the Postmaster General upon the settlements of public accounts shall be final and conclusive upon the executive branch of the government,' except that any person whose accounts may have been 'settled,' the head of the executive department, etc., to which the account pertains, or the Comptroller of the Treasury, may, within a year, obtain a revision in the manner stated; also that 'any person accepting payment under a settlement by an auditor shall be thereby precluded from obtaining a revision of such settlement as to any items from which payment is accepted;' and, further, that 'when suspended items are finally settled a revision may be had as in the case of the original settlement.' By the act of May 28, 1896, chap. 252,  4 (29 Stat. at L. 140, 179, Comp. Stat. 1913,  390 ), the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to make report annually to Congress of such officers as were found 'upon final settlement of their accounts' to have been indebted to the government, \n\n[240 U.S. 214, 221]\n\u00a0\n and to have failed to pay the amount of their indebtedness into the Treasury.\n We should not say, of course, that instances may not be found in which the word 'settlement' has been used in acts of Congress in other senses, or in the sense of 'payment.' But it is apparent that the word 'settlement' in connection with public contracts and accounts, which are the subject of prescribed scrutiny for the purpose of ascertaining the rights and obligations of the United States, has a well-defined meaning as denoting the appropriate administrative determination with respect to the amount due. We think that the words 'final settlement' in the act of 1905 had reference to the time of this determination when, so far as the government was concerned, the amount which it was finally bound to pay or entitled to receive was fixed administratively by the proper authority. It is manifestly of the utmost importance that there should be no uncertainty in the time from which the six months' period runs. The time of the final administrative determination of the amount due is a definite time, fixed by public record and readily ascertained. As an administrative matter, it does not depend upon the consent or agreement of the other party to the contract or account. The authority to make it may not be suspended, or held in abeyance, by refusal to agree. Whether the amount so fixed is due, in law and fact, undoubtedly remains a question to be adjudicated, if properly raised in judicial proceedings, but this does not affect the running of the time for bringing action under the statutory provision.\n In the present case, the construction of the building was in charge of the Secretary of the Treasury and under the general supervision of the supervising architect. The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to remit the whole or any part of the stipulated liquidated damages as in his discretion might be just and equitable. \n\n[240 U.S. 214, 222]\n\u00a0\n 32 Stat. at L. 326, chap. 1036, Comp. Stat 1913,  6922. On August 21, 1912, the supervising architect having received the certificate of the chief of the technical division of the office that all work embraced in the contract had been satisfactorily completed, made his statement of the amount finally due, recommending that only the actual damage (as stated) be charged against the contractor, and that the proper voucher should be issued in favor of the contractor for the balance, to wit, $3,999.01. And, on the same date, this recommendation was approved and actual damages charged accordingly by direction of the Secretary of the Treasury. This, in our judgment, was the 'final settlement' of the contract within the meaning of the act. We understand that the administrative construction of the act has been to the same effect. The regulation of the Treasury Department, as it appears from its circular issued for the information of persons interested in claims for material and labor supplied in the prosecution of work on buildings under the control of that Department ( Dept. Cire. No. 45, Sept. 12, 1912), is as follows: 'The Department treats as the date of final settlement mentioned in said acts' (referring to the Acts of 1894 and 1905, supra), 'the date on which the Department approves the basis of settlement under such contract recommended by the supervising architect, and orders payment accordingly.'\n We conclude that the action was not brought prematurely.\n\n 2. \nWith respect to the amendment of the complaint, it is apparent that, as there was an existing right of action under the statute at the time the suit was brought, the case was not within the decision in United States ex rel. Texas Portland Cement Co. v. McCord, \n233 U.S. 157\n, 58 L. ed. 893, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 550. No new or different cause of action was alleged in the amended complaint. The court merely permitted the defective statement of the existing right to be corrected by the addition of appropriate allegations, \n\n[240 U.S. 214, 223]\n\u00a0\n and in this there was no error. Rev. Stat.  954, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1591; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Wulf, \n226 \nU.S. 570, 576\n, 57 S. L. ed. 355, 363, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 135, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 134.\n\n 3. \nIt is contended that the right given by the statute to the described creditors is of an equitable nature, and that the court erred in permitting recovery at law. The objection in the present case is merely technical, as the parties stipulated to waive trial by jury, and the case was heard and decided by the district judge upon facts about which there is no dispute. The question has not been raised heretofore in this court, but it has been assumed in many cases that the action to be brought under the statute upon the contractor's bond, whether the action were instituted by the United States (United States v. Congress Constr. Co. \n222 U.S. 199\n, 56 L. ed. 163, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44), or by creditors in the name of the United States, was an action at law. United States Fidelity & G. Co. v. United States, \n209 U.S. 306\n, 52 L. ed. 804, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 537; Mankin v. United States, \n215 U.S. 533\n, 54 L. ed. 315, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174; Title Guaranty & T. Co. v.

Rep. 108. In Title Guaranty & T. Co. v. Crane Co. \n219 \nU.S. 24, 35\n, 55 S. L. ed. 72, 77, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 140, a question arose as to the propriety of allowing a docket fee to each claimant. Section 824 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. Stat. 1913,  1378), provides for a docket fee of $10 'in cases at law, when judgment is rendered without a jury.' The court said: 'The allowance of a docket fee of $10 to each claimant appears to us to be correct. Rev. Stat.  824. The claims are several and represent distinct causes of action in different parties, although consolidated in a single suit.' In the circuit and district courts and in the circuit courts of appeals, while it seems that objection has rarely been made, there has been almost complete uniformity in treating the creditors' action under the act of 1905 as one at law.

It was expressly held to be an action at law in United States ex rel. Proctor Mfg. Co. v. Stannard (D. C. N. D. N. Y.) 207 Fed. 198, 202. The contrary conclusion was reached in United States use of Brading-Marshal Lumber Co. v. Wells (D. C. E. D. Tenn .), 203 Fed. 146, 147; Illinois Surety Co. v. United States (C. C. A. 2d. C.) 129 C.

The point was raised on rehearing in United States use of John Davis Co. v. Illinois Surety Co. (C. C. A. 7th C.) 226 Fed. pp. 663, 664, but, as it came too late, it was not decided.\n The statute provides that the bond shall have 'the additional obligation that such contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them with labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract.' In this respect, the provision is substantially the same as that contained in the act of 1894, and the obligation in favor of the materialmen and laborers has been held to be a distinct obligation. United States Fidelity & G. Co. v. Golden Pressed Brick & Fire Co. (United States Fidelity & G. Co. v. United States) \n191 \nU.S. 416, 423\n, 425 S., 48 L. ed. 242, 245, 246, 24 Sup. Ct.

It is an obligation for the payment of money to the persons described, which they are entitled to enforce. The nature of the obligation is not changed by the fact that there is to be but one action. If the United States brings the action, the persons described are entitled to be made parties, and 'to have their rights and claims adjudicated in such action, and judgment rendered \n\n[240 U.S. 214, 225]\n\u00a0\n thereon.' If the United States does not sue within the time specified, they may bring action on the bond in the name of the United States, and 'prosecute the same to final judgment and execution.' Any creditor who duly presents his claim in such an action becomes a party thereto with a distinct cause of action. Title Guaranty & T. Co. v. Crane Co. \n219 \nU.S. 24, 35\n, 55 S. L. ed. 72, 77, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 140. The obligation of the surety thus enforced in a single action is a legal obligation to the United States for the use and benefit of the several claimants. We do not regard the requirements that 'the claim and judgment of the United States' shall have priority, and that the aggregate recovery shall not exceed the penalty on the bond, as insuperable obstacles to proceeding at law. It is the case of an undertaking for the payment of many claims, not to exceed the specified penalty. If the total amount due exceeds the penalty of the bond, it is provided that 'judgment shall be given to each creditor pro rata of the amount of the recovery.' This, however, merely requires an arithmetical calculation after the different causes of action have been passed upon, and the amount due upon each determined. We see no ground upon which the conclusion can be justified that the liability of the surety on its bond is to be determined in equity. The contrary has been the generally accepted, and we think, the correct, practice.\n It should be added that a different situation would arise if the surety, availing itself of the statutory privilege, should pay into court the full amount of its liability, to wit, the penalty on the bond, for distribution. In that case the legal obligation of the surety would be discharged by the express terms of the statute, and the proceeding would be simply for the distribution of a fund in court.\n\n 4. \nThe plaintiff in error contends that the court erred in giving judgment in favor of the Carolina Electrical Company. The record shows that among those named as the persons instituting the action was the 'Electrical \n\n[240 U.S. 214, 226]\n\u00a0\n Engineering & Contracting Company, assignee of Joseph B. Cheshire, Jr., receiver of the Carolina Electrical Company.' The complaint set forth that the Carolina Electrical Company (a North Carolina corporation) had furnished to the contractor certain material and labor for which there remained unpaid the sum of $498.69; that on October 4, 1912, Joseph B. Cheshire, Jr., was appointed receiver of that company; and that on March 1, 1913, its claim had been 'assigned and transferred for value' to the above- named plaintiff by the receiver, and that the plaintiff was the sole owner of the account, and had succeeded to all the rights incident thereto which had belonged to the Carolina Electrical Company. The alleged transfer was denied. Evidence was introduced to show the incorporation, and the appointment of the receiver. The district judge found that the order proved was insufficient to establish the authority of the receiver to assign the claim, but held that the proceeding in the case was a sufficient filing of the claim on behalf of the Carolina Electrical Company. Judgment was awarded in favor of that company, with direction that it should be paid 'only to such person as may be authorized by law to receive it for said Carolina Electrical Company,' and the judgment to this effect was affirmed.\n In this, we think, the court erred. The Carolina Electrical Company was not one of the plaintiffs and there was no intervention on its behalf. The trial court in its findings sets forth the interventions of certain other parties, and states that no more interventions appear to have been filed in the cause. It is true, of course, that the real party in interest who is entitled to enforce the cause of action may be substituted as plaintiff. See McDonald v. Nebraska, 41 C. C. A. 278, 101 Fed. 171, 178. But the present case is not one of misnomer, or of a nominal plaintiff for whom the real party in interest is substituted, or indeed of any proper substitution. The plaintiff, the Electrical Engineering- \n\n[240 U.S. 214, 227]\n\u00a0\n & Contracting Company, was not a nominal party, nor was the action in any sense brought for the benefit of the Carolina Electrical Company. The record shows that it was brought, so far as this claim is concerned, solely for the benefit of the Electrical Engineering & Contracting Company upon the allegation that the claim had been assigned to it for value, and that it was the exclusive and beneficial owner. According to the record, the Carolina Electrical Company was not made a party at any stage of the action unless this was accomplished by the decision and the judgment. But at the time of the decision, November 10, 1913, by reason of the express limitation of the statute, it was too late for that company to intervene.\n The judgment is modified by striking out the provision in favor of the Carolina Electrical Company, and as thus modified is affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The statute is set forth in full in the margin of the opinion in the case cited. \n\n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE INDIANA TRANSP CO.(1916)\nNo. 25\nArgued: Decided: December 18, 1916\n\n\n\n Mr. Harry W. Standidge for the petition.\n\n Memorandum opinion by Mr. Chief Justice White, by direction of the court:\n Speaking in a general sense, on the ground that in an admiralty cause pending in the district court of the United States for the northern district of Illinois, one of the judges of that court had, by an order which he was absolutely devoid of jurisdiction to make, permitted more than 270 persons to become colibellants, an application by the defendant in the cause was made on the 16th day of October, 1916, for leave to file a petition for prohibition directed to the judge in question, to prevent the carrying out of the order. On the 23d of October \n\n[242 U.S. 281, 282]\n\u00a0\n permission to file the petition for prohibition was granted and a rule to show cause was directed to be issued to the Honorable Kenesaw M. Landis, the judge by whom the order complained of was made. On the day upon which this rule was returnable, December 4, there was no response to the rule made on behalf of the respondent judge, but by oral motion a request was made on behalf of the parties who, it was asserted, had been mistakenly permitted to become colibellants, that they be treated as the respondents to the rule, and be permitted in that capacity to file a return to the rule, a copy of which return was prepared to be filed and presented for filing in case the permission asked was granted, and that request is the matter now before us for consideration.\n We are of opinion, however, that the substitution of respondents asked for cannot be granted, since it is apparent that the judge who rendered the order and against whom the writ prayed for, if allowed, is to be directed, is the essential party respondent, however much, when his return to the rule is made, either by his authority, or because of their interest in the result, or as friends of the court, the persons to be adversely affected by the granting of the relief prayed may be heard to sustain the sufficiency of the return when that subject arises for consideration. We therefore transfer the date fixed for the return in the original rule to show cause from the 4th day of December, 1916, to the 15th day of January, 1917, in order to afford ample opportunity for the making by the respondent judge of the return which the original order calls for.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINDIAN TERRITORY ILLUMINATING OIL CO. v. STATE OF OKLAHOMA(1916)\nNo. 283\nArgued: Decided: April 3, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. Preston C. West and John H. Brennan for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John B. Harrison and J. H. Miley, and Mr. S. P. Freeling, Attorney General of Oklahoma, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question in the case is whether a certain assignment of a lease and rights thereunder, made by the Osage Tribe \n\n[240 U.S. 522, 523]\n\u00a0\n of Indians, which lease conferred the privilege of prospecting, drilling wells and mining and producing petroleum and natural gas upon lands in Oklahoma territory, are subject to a tax assessed under the laws of Oklahoma as the property of plaintiff in error in its capacity of a public service corporation. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Plaintiff in error, herein designated as the oil company, is assignee of the lease, and asserts the negative of the question, contending that under the lease and the assignment of the lease it became 'a Federal agent, acting under a Federal appointment and authorization, in the development of lands belonging to the Osage Tribe of Indians in the Osage Reservation, and that its business, license, or permit as such cannot be taxed by the state government, although its physical properties are always subject to taxation.' It rests its contention upon an act of Congress of February 28, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 794, 795, chap. 383, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4195), and an act of Congress of March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 1049, 1061, chap. 1479, Comp. Stat. 1913, 3986), which extended the lease to the extent of such portion of the lands as had been subleased, namely, 680,000 acres.\n By the act of 1891 it was provided: 'That where lands are occupied by Indians who have bought and paid for the same, and which lands are not needed for farming or agricultural purposes, and are not desired for individual allotments, the same may be leased by authority of \n\n[240 U.S. 522, 524]\n\u00a0\n the council speaking for such Indians, for a period not to exceed five years for grazing, or ten years for mining purposes in such quantities and upon such terms and conditions as the agent in charge of such reservation may recommend, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.' Comp. St. 1913,  4218\n\n\n The act of 1905 recognized the oil company as the owner by assignment of the lease, which assignment was approved by the Secretary of the Interior, and extended the lease for a period of ten years from March 16, 1906, with all the conditons of the original lease except that from and after that date the royalty to be paid on gas should be $100 per annum on each gas well instead of $50, as provided in the lease, and except that the President of the United States should determine the amount of royalty to be paid to all.\n The state opposes the contentions of the oil company and asserts that the lease was 'not a grant of any authority, franchise, or privilege to any particular person or corporation, and is merely a permit to the Osage Tribe, authorizing such tribe to lease to any person or any number of persons upon the approval of such lease contract by the Secretary of the Interior.' It further asserts that the oil company merely occupied 'the position of an independent contractor, acting for itself and in its own behalf, in a contract with the Osage Indian Tribe,' and that therefore the relation of principal and agent between it and the government did not exist.\n A statement of the case is as follows: The oil company made a sworn return of what it considered the fair cash value of that part of its property engaged in the public service at $53,835.10. The State Board of Equalization, after a hearing, increased the valuation to $538,350, the basis of the order of the Board being that the oil company was not protected from taxation by the lease from the Indians. Under the procedure of the state, the \n\n[240 U.S. 522, 525]\n\u00a0\n oil company appealed from that order to the supreme court of the state.\n In the latter court a referee was appointed to take testimony and report his findings of fact and conclusions of law. He duly reported the facts and from them also reported as a conclusion of law that the oil company was 'liable to taxation by the state of Oklahoma for the full value of its property, tangible and intangible,-that is, for the sum of $ 500,000;' and that it was 'not exempt from taxation upon the theory that it is a Federal agent, or that it holds a franchise from the Federal government.' And he recommended that judgment be entered fixing the assessment of the oil company's property for taxation for the year 1911 at $ 447,169.98, this being the difference between the total value of all the property and the amount ($52,830.02) locally assessed.\n The report was confirmed, the court adjudging that the property of the oil company be assessed as recommended by the referee.\n The question in the case seems to be a simple one. It is given some complexity by the opinions of the court on the hearing and rehearing, which require some reconciliation. It appears from the findings of the referee that on March 16, 1896, the Osage Nation of Indians in Oklahoma territory entered into a contract with one Edwin B. Foster, by the terms of which Foster had a blanket lease upon the Osage Indian Reservation for the sole purpose of prospecting and drilling wells and mining and producing petroleum and natural gas only. The lease was for a term of ten years, and was approved by the Secretary of the Interior. By an act passed March 3, 1905, Congress extended the lease as to 680,000 acres for ten years. The lease has therefore expired. Prior to its extension in 1905, the lease was assigned to the oil company.\n The oil company has sublet to more than one hundred persons and corporations and the operations upon most \n\n[240 U.S. 522, 526]\n\u00a0\n of the lands covered by the lease have been and are conducted by sublessees. A small portion, the amount not appearing, is operated by the company.\n By the terms of the lease as extended, the sublessees are required to pay a royalty of 1\/6 of the oil produced upon the property, of which 1\/24 goes to the company and 3\/24 to the Indians, the payments on behalf of the latter being made to the Indian Agency under and by virtue of the rules and regulations of the Department of the Interior.\n The oil company has laid pipe lines upon the leased lands for conveying natural gas, and it has been its practice to furnish gas to the sublessee for use as fuel for their drilling and pumping operations at a flat rate, the amount of which is not disclosed. The company also furnished gas during 1911 for domestic consumption to the residents of Bigheart and Avant, two small towns in which it had no franchise, in the Osage Nation, adjacent to the pipe lines of the company. It also furnished gas to a local corporation in the city of Bartlesville, which company held a franchise for and was engaged in the business of selling gas to the residents of that city, and also to a local distributing company at the town of Ochelata for use in the business of the latter company in selling gas to the inhabitants of that town.\n By the terms of the contract with the Osage Indians the company was required to furnish gas free to the Osage citizens for use in the public institutions of the Osages under certain conditions named.\n The oil company is primarily engaged in the business of oil production, and its operations in the gas business are conducted as an incident to the development of the oil territory and the production of oil, and, to some extent, as a matter of accommodation to the citizens of Bigheart and Avant, and other persons residing along the company's pipe lines. \n\n[240 U.S. 522, 527]\n\u00a0\n In 1911 the company made a sworn return of $53,835.10 as the actual cash value of that part of its property engaged in the public service by reason of the gas business transacted by the company. This valuation was raised by the Board of Equalization to $538,350. Certain of the company's property was returned to local assessors and assessed at $52,830.02. All of its property is situated in Osage and Washington counties, Oklahoma, and the total value of its stock, including all its property, tangible and intangible, on February 1, 1911, was $500,000.\n The property returned to the Board of Equalization and to the local assessors did not include the lease, subleases, contracts, and franchises of the company, but only its physical property, it being contended by the company that such lease, subleases, contracts, and franchises were not subject to taxation.\n The total value of the company's property of every kind located in Oklahoma over and above the amount locally assessed was $447,169.98 on February 1, 1911.\n The gas business of the company has not been profitable, but has been and is valuable as an adjunct to its oil operations.\n Against the confirmation of the report of the referee the court said that the oil company made four contentions: (1) That it was not a public service corporation and that the Board of Equalization was without authority to assess its property. (2) That its oil and gas leases were not property used in any public service rendered by it. (3) That the leases were not subject to taxation in the hands of the lessee or his assigns. (4) That in exercising rights under the laws and by the act of Congress extending the lease the oil company was a Federal agency, or exercised a privilege or franchise granted by the Federal government, and that the lease, therefore, was not subject to taxation.\n The court held: (1) that the company was a public service corporation ; (2) that the Board of Equalization \n\n[240 U.S. 522, 528]\n\u00a0\n had the power to assess to the company other property than that used in connection with public service; (3) that the oil and gas lease was property and must be assessed in the name of the owner of the lease, and not in the name of the lessor; and (4) that by reason of the act of Congress of 1905 the gas, oil, and other minerals under the lands remained the property of the Osage Tribe, and that the power of Congress over the property could not be questioned. And, distinguishing between the property of a Federal agent and the operations of such agent, it was held 'that the tax sought to be levied was not invalid because sought to be levied upon a Federal agency or upon a franchise granted by the Federal government; or because it interferes with the power of Congress to regulate commerce between the Indian Tribes.'\n On rehearing the court modified or changed its view. The changes and the reasons for them are not easy to represent. In the first opinion the report of the referee was confirmed and it was adjudged 'that the property of appellant [oil company] be assessed as recommended by the referee in his report.' In the second opinion the report of the referee is again confirmed and the estimate of the property of the company at $500,000 held to be sustained by the testimony taken by the referee; but the reasoning of the opinions is quite different. For a statement of the difference we may adopt for convenience that of the Attorney General of the state. He says: ' . . . the essential difference between the original opinion and the opinion on rehearing being that in the original opinion it was held that oil and gas leases, as such, constitute property as defined by the Constitution and statutes of the state of Oklahoma, and as such was subject to taxation by said state, while the opinion on rehearing held that oil and gas leases, as such, were not defined as personal property subject to taxation under the statutes of Oklahoma, nor by the Constitution of said state, and, therefore, could not \n\n[240 U.S. 522, 529]\n\u00a0\n be taxed as personal property; but that under the statutes the market value of the capital stock of said corporation could be taken into consideration by the State Board of Equalization in assessing the properties of said company, and could be properly considered as an element of value in assessing said properties, and that the evidence taken before the referee as to the amount of the capital stock of said company and the market value thereof, together, with its tangible assets, was sufficient to sustain the assessment made by the State Board of Equalization.'\n It is clear that the Board of Equalization and the referee sustaining its action proceeded upon the consideration that the leases constituted taxable property, and the first opinion of the court, confirming the report of the referee, had its basis in the same consideration. That consideration was regarded as untenable in the second opinion, but the court adhered to its former conclusion; that is, that the report of the referee should be confirmed. The Board of Equalization, the referee, and the court in its first opinion, regarded the leases as taxable entities. In the second opinion it was held that they could not be so regarded under the Constitution of the state, but the court gave them effective representation in the capital stock of the company, and the latter then was taken as evidence that the value of the property of the oil company was $500,000. Whether the Constitution of the state permits this accommodation we are not called upon to say. We are clear it cannot be permitted to relieve from the restraints upon the power of the state to tax property under the protection of the Federal government. That the leases have the immunity of such protection we have decided.\n In Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. Harrison, \n235 U.S. 292\n, 59 L. ed. 234, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 27, the railroad company was the lessee of certain coal mines, obligating itself to take out annually specified amounts of coal and to pay a stipulated royalty. It proceeded actively \n\n[240 U.S. 522, 530]\n\u00a0\n to develop the mines, either directly or through its agent, and took therefrom large quantities of coal and fully complied with the obligations assumed. The state of Oklahoma attempted to tax the company under the law of the state requiring every person engaged in the mining or production of coal to make a report of the kind and amount produced and the actual cash value thereof, and at the same time pay to the state treasurer a gross revenue tax in addition to the taxes levied upon an ad valorem basis upon such mining property, equal to 2 per cent of the gross receipts from the total production. The law was held to be invalid as attempting to tax an instrumentality through which the United States was performing its duty to the Indians.\n The application of the case to that at bar needs no assisting comment. A tax upon the leases is a tax upon the power to make them, could be used to destroy the power to make them. If they cannot be taxed as entities they cannot be taxed vicariously by taxing the stock, whose only value is their value, or by taking the stock as an evidence or measure of their value, rather than by directly estimating them as the Board of Equalization and the referee did. The assessment by the Board was of the leases as objects of taxation, having no immunity under Federal law. This was repeated by the referee, and he made it clear that the assessment was so constituted. There was, he reports, a local assessment by the assessors of Osage and Washington counties of $52,830.02, and that the total value of the oil company's 'property of every kind located in Oklahoma, over and above the amount locally assessed, was $447,169.98, on February 1, 1911,' and he recommended a judgment for the latter amount. And, we repeat, there is no doubt of what elements it was composed. The gas business, he reports, was not 'of itself profitable,' but was 'valuable as an adjunct to the company's oil operations.' He was explicit as to what \n\n[240 U.S. 522, 531]\n\u00a0\n the stock of the company represented, saying that 'the total value of said company's stock, including all its property, tangible and intangible, on the first day of February, 1911, was $500,000.' It is manifest, therefore, when the court took the stock as evidence of the value of the property of the company the court took it as evidence of the value of the leases, and thereby justified their assessment and taxation. This, for the reasons we have stated, was error.\n It follows from these views that the assessment against the oil company, so far as it included the leases, whether as separate objects of taxation or as represented or valued by the stock of the company, is invalid.\n Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is provided by  7338, Revised Laws of 1910, that 'every public service corporation organized, existing or doing business in this state shall on or before the last day of February of each year return sworn lists or schedules of its taxable property as hereinafter provided, or as may be required by the State Board of Equalization, and such property shall be listed with reference to amount, kind and value on the first day of February of the year in which it is listed; and said property shall be subject to taxation for state, county, municipal, public school and other purposes, to the same extent as the real and personal property of private persons.' \n\n\n\n\n","90":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINNES v.

The accused was taken to Texas, tried for murder and a conspiracy to commit murder, and acquitted.

Crim. Rep. --, L.R.A. --, --, 173 S. W. 291.\n All the Federal questions involve the meaning of  2 of article 4 of the Constitution, which is as follows: 'A person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime, who shall flee from justice and be found in another state, shall, on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.' They also depend on  5278 of the Revised Statutes, which is but a reproduction of  1 of the act of February 12, 1793 (chap. 7, 1 Stat. at L. 302, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,126), giving effect to and establishing the methods of procedure to be resorted to for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Constitution on the subject to the extent that their execution was by the statute provided for.\n Broadly, there is but a single question for consideration: Was the order for rendition repugnant to the Constitution and the provisions of the statute? But two inquiries are involved in its solution: First, was the rendition order void because, under the facts, there was no power to award it except by disregarding express prohibitions or requirements of the Constitution or statute, or by necessary implication adversely affecting rights thereby created? and second, even although this was not the case, was the order nevertheless void because, under the circumstances, it dealt with a situation which, by the effect of the statute, was taken out of the reach of state authority, even although no express provision was made in the statute for dealing with such condition by any authority, state or Federal? We consider the two inquiries under separate headings.\n First. For the purpose of the solution of the inquiry under this heading we treat the following propositions as beyond question: (a) That prior to the adoption of the \n\n[240 U.S. 127, 131]\n\u00a0\n Constitution fugitives from justice were surrendered between the states conformably to what were deemed to be the controlling principles of comity. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 101, 102, 16 L. ed. 717, 727; 2 Moore, Extradition & Interstate Rendition, pp. 820 et seq. (b) That it was intended by the provision of the Constitution to fully embrace or rather to confer authority upon Congress to deal with such subject. Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 10 L. ed. 1060; Kentucky v. Dennison, supra; Taylor v. Taintor, 16 Wall. 366, 21 L. ed. 287; Appleyard v. Massachusetts, \n203 U.S. 222\n, 51 L. ed. 161, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 122, 7 Ann. Cas. 1073; (c) That the act of 1793 (now Revised Statutes,  5278, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10, 126) was enacted for the purpose of controlling the subject in so far as it was deemed wise to do so, and that its provisions were intended to be dominant, and, so far as they operated, controlling and exclusive of state power. Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 10 L. ed. 1060; Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 104, 105, 16 L. ed. 728; Mahon v. Justice, \n127 U.S. 700\n, 32 L. ed. 283, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1204; Lascelles v.

Rep. 687.\n Coming in the light of these principles to apply the statute, it is not open to question that its provisions expressly or by necessary implication prohibited the surrender of a person in one state for removal as a fugitive to another where it clearly appears that the person was not and could not have been a fugitive from the justice of the demanding state.

Cas. 905.\n From this it results that the first inquiry here is, did it appear that the accused was a fugitive from the justice of the state of Georgia? While the facts which we have stated do not disclose affirmatively that she was ever in Georgia, and the date, if at all, of her flight from that state, we think that she was such a fugitive is to be assumed for three obvious reasons: because there was no question of such fact made in the application for habeas corpus, since it is apparent on the face of the application that the ground of relief relied upon was not that there had \n\n[240 U.S. 127, 132]\n\u00a0\n been no flight from Georgia, but that there was and could have been no flight into Texas, since the coming into that state was involuntary and resulted solely from the extradition proceedings; because that view of the subject was assumed, both in the elaborate opinion of the court below and that of the dissenting judge, to be unquestioned; and finally, because neither in the assignments of error in this court nor in the arguments pressed upon our attention is the contrary view insisted upon or even suggested. From that aspect, therefore, there is no ground for saying that the extradition order conflicted with the express provision of the statute.\n Was there a conflict between the statute and the order for removal to Georgia, arising by necessary implication from the fact that the accused had been brought into the state of Texas on a requisition upon the state of Oregon, and had not been released from custody or been returned to Oregon, is the only remaining question under this heading. While it is quite true, as pointed out in the opinion of the court below, and in that of the judge who dissented, that there are some decided cases and opinions expressed by text writers which sustain the affirmative view of this inquiry, the subject is here not an open one since it has been expressly foreclosed by the decision in Lascelles v. Georgia, \n148 U.S. 537\n, 37 L. ed. 549, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 687. In that case the issue for decision was whether a person accused, who had been removed to the state of Georgia from another state on extradition proceedings for trial for a specified crime, was liable in Georgia to be tried for another and different crime. Reviewing the whole subject and calling attention to the broad lines of distinction between international extradition of fugitives from justice and interstate rendition of such fugitives under the Constitution and the provisions of the act of Congress, and the error of assuming that the doctrine of asylum applicable under international law to the one case was applicable to the other, it was \n\n[240 U.S. 127, 133]\n\u00a0\n held that the right to prosecute for such other offense existed. The court said: 'Neither the Constitution nor the act of Congress providing for the rendition of fugitives upon proper requisition being made confers, either expressly or by implication, any right or privilege upon such fugitives under and by virtue of which they can assert, in the state to which they are returned, exemption from trial for any criminal act done therein. No purpose or intention is manifested to afford them any immunity or protection from trial and punishment for any offenses committed in the state from which they flee. On the contrary, the provision of both the Constitution and the statutes extends to all crimes and offenses punishable by the laws of the state where the act is done. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 101, 102, 16 L. ed. 717, 727; Ex parte Reggel, \n114 U.S. 642\n, 29 L. ed. 250, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1148, 5 Am. Crim. Rep. 218.'\n We are thus brought to the remaining heading, which is:\n Second. Although the order for rendition was not in conflict, either expressly or by necessary implication, with any of the provisions of the Constitution or statute, was it nevertheless void under the circumstances because it dealt with a subject with which it was beyond the power of the state to deal, and which was therefore brought, as the result of the adoption of the statute, within exclusive Federal control, although no provision dealing with such subject is found in the statute? To appreciate this question, the proposition relied upon needs to be accurately stated. It is this: The Constitution provides for the rendition to a state of a person who shall have fled from justice and be found in another state; that is, for the surrender by the state in which the fugitive is found. This, it is conceded, would cover the case and sustain the authority exercised, as the accused was a fugitive from the justice of Georgia and was found in Texas. But the proposition insists that the statute is not as broad as the Constitution, since it provides not for the surrender of the fugitive \n\n[240 U.S. 127, 134]\n\u00a0\n by the state in which he is found, but only for his surrender by the state into which he has fled, thus leaving unprovided for the case of a fugitive from justice who is found in a state, but who has not fled into such state, because brought into such state involuntarily by a requisition from another. And the argument is supported by the contention that, as the statute exercises the power conferred by the Constitution and is exclusive, it occupies the whole field and prohibits all state action even upon a subject for which the statute has not provided, and which therefore in no manner comes within its express terms. But we are of the opinion that the contention rests upon a mistaken premise and unwarrantedly extends the scope of the decided cases upon which it relies. The first, because it erroneously assumes that although the statute leaves a subject with which there was power to deal under the Constitution unprovided for, it therefore took all matters within such unprovided area out of any possible state action. And the second, because, while it is undoubtedly true that in the decided cases relied upon (Kentucky v. Dennison, supra; Roberts v. Reilly, \n166 U.S. 80\n, 29 L. ed. 544, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 291; Hyatt v. New York, \n188 U.S. 691\n, 47 L. ed. 657, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456, 12 Am. Crim. Rep. 311) the exclusive character of the legislation embodied in the statute was recognized, those cases, when rightly considered, go no further than to establish the exclusion by the statute of all state action from the matters for which the statute expressly or by necessary implication provided.\n No reason is suggested nor have we been able to discover any, to sustain the assumption that the framers of the statute, in not making its provisions exactly coterminous with the power granted by the Constitution, did so for the purpose of leaving the subject, so far as unprovided for, beyond the operation of any legal authority whatever, state or national. On the contrary, when the situation with which the statute dealt is contemplated, the reasonable assumption is that by the omission to \n\n[240 U.S. 127, 135]\n\u00a0\n extend the statute to the full limits of constitutional power it must have been intended to leave the subjects unprovided for not beyond the pale of all law, but subject to the power which then controlled them,-state authority until it was deemed essential by further legislation to govern them exclusively by national authority. In fact, such conclusion is essential to give effect to the act of Congress, since to hold to the contrary would render inefficacious the regulations provided concerning the subjects with which it dealt. This becomes manifest when it is considered that, if the proposition now insisted upon were accepted, it would follow that the delivery of a criminal who was a fugitive from justice by one state on a requisition by another would exhaust the power, and the criminal, therefore, whatever might be the extent and character of the crimes committed in other states, would remain in the state into which he had been removed without any authority to deliver him to other states from whose justice he had fled. And this, while paralyzing the authority of all the states, it must be moreover apparent, would cause them all to become involuntary asylums for criminals; for no method is suggested by which a criminal brought into a state by requisition, if acquitted, could be against his will deported, since to admit such power would be virtually to concede the right to surrender him to another state as a fugitive from justice for a crime committed within its borders.\n It follows from what we have said that the court below was right in refusing to discharge the accused, and its judgment, therefore, must be and it is affirmed.\n By stipulation of counsel a similar judgment will be entered in case of Victor E. Innes v. Tobin, Sheriff, No. 533. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTER-ISLAND STEAM NAV CO. v. WARD(1916)\nNo. 638\nArgued: Decided: October 30, 1916\n\n\n\n Mr. E. A. Douthitt, for defendant in error. \n\n[242 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. O. Smith for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Alexander Britton, in behalf of\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n On writ of error prosecuted from the court below to a judgment of the supreme court of Hawaii, rendered in a case where there was no Federal question and no diversity of citizenship, the judgment was affirmed and the case was brought here. By a motion to dismiss, our jurisdiction is disputed, and to dispose of it requires a consideration of  246 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the act of January 28, 1915 (38 Stat. at L. 803, chap. 22).\n That amendment provides, first, that 'writs of error and appeals from the final judgments and decrees of the supreme court of the territory of Hawaii and of the supreme court of Porto Rico may be taken and prosecuted to the Supreme Court of the United States . . . in the same classes of cases, in which writs of error and appeals from the final judgments and decrees of the highest court of a state in which a decision in the suit could be had, may be taken and prosecuted to the Supreme Court of the United States . . .' And this is immediately followed by a provision giving power to this court to review by certiorari 'in all other cases, civil or criminal, in the supreme court of the territory of Hawaii or the supreme court of Porto Rico.' The next and separate sentence which follows these provisions and which concludes the amendment is this: 'Writs of error and appeals from the final judgments and decrees of the supreme courts of the territory of Hawaii and of Porto Rico, wherein the amount involved, exclusive of costs, . . . exceeds the value of $5,000, may be taken and prosecuted in the circuit courts of appeals.'\n The argument supporting jurisdiction is that as, by the \n\n[242 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n general provisions of the judiciary act of 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517], now embraced in  241 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1218], power exists in this court to review by error or appeal the final decisions of the circuit courts of appeals in all cases where the jurisdiction of the trial court did not depend upon diversity of citizenship, or where the case was not otherwise by provisions of law expressly made final in the circuit courts of appeals, therefore power to review exists, since this case is not in one of the excepted classes. But the contention overlooks the fact that from the beginning and continuously up to the adoption of the amendment of 1915, appeals and writs of error to the supreme courts of Hawaii and of Porto Rico were not left to be controlled by the law generally applicable to courts of the United States, as expressed in the judiciary act of 1891, or as found in the provisions of the Judicial Code, re-adopting that act, but were governed by special provisions controlling the subject,-a purpose which is exemplified by the terms of the amendatory act of 1915. This is plain when it is considered that the two classes of cases enumerated in the amendment of 1915 were practically in the same terms expressed in the prior acts, which conferred reviewing jurisdiction in both classes exclusively upon this court, and that the only substantial change made by the amendatory act was to take from this court the jurisdiction to review in the second enumerated class and confer it upon the circuit court of appeals to which Hawaii belonged. And, indeed, there is nothing in the context of the statute which countenances the view that the statute intended to merely take away the jurisdiction of this court in one class of cases, and, at the same time, to restore jurisdiction as to the same class by means of a power conferred or contemplated to exist to review on error or appeal the judgments and decrees of the circuit court of appeals. Besides, as the remedy intended to be afforded by the amendment of 1915 was evidently the restricting of the jurisdiction \n\n[242 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n of this court, to the end that the burden on its docket might be lightened, we cannot construe that amendment as frustrating the purpose which it was adopted to accomplish.

Thompson for defendants in error. \n\n[239 U.S. 560, 564]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff in error recovered a judgment in one of the courts of the state of Tennessee upon a cause of action that arose out of a written contract, dated May 24, 1909, whereby it agreed to 'engage and book' for the firm of Catron & Albert, then operating a theater in Chattanooga, Tennessee, a certain number of 'vauldeville acts' each week for certain weeks in each year, during the continuance of the contract, in consideration of the payment weekly of a 'booking fee' of $10 and a commission of 5 per cent upon the salary of each performer. It appeared that plaintiff in error was a corporation of the state of Missouri, but had a situs in Chicago, Illinois. Upon the ground that it was guilty of noncompliance with the statute of Tennessee relating to foreign corporations doing business in the state, in that it had failed to file a copy of its charter in the office of the secretary of state, the supreme court of Tennessee reversed the judgment and dismissed the suit (128 Tenn. 417, 161 S. W. 488), and the case comes here upon questions raised under the 'commerce clause' of the Constitution of the United States and the 'due process of law' and 'equal protection' clauses of the 14th Amendment.\n Excerpts from the statute are set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[239 U.S. 560, 565]\n\u00a0\n It is the insistence of plaintiff in error that it could not, consistently with the cited provisions of the Federal Constitution, be required to subject itself to the law of the state unless it was doing business within the state; and that in fact it did no such business, or, if it did any, it was interstate commerce, not subject to state regulation.\n Respecting the effect of the written contract under which the cause of action arose, the court held that it created merely the relationship of principal and agent between the parties; that by it plaintiff in error became the agent of Catron & Albert, bound to render them the personal services called for by the contract in consideration of the specified sums to be paid by them to it, and that this consideration was to be forwarded weekly by Catron & Albert from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Chicago, Illinois, where the office of plaintiff in error was located; that by the terms of the agreement plaintiff in error was not to be responsible for failure on the part of the actors to fulfil their contracts, nor for any accident or delay preventing their arrival in Chattanooga at the times appointed; that under the contract and the evidence showing the execution of it, it was not contemplated that plaintiff in error should engage, nor did it, so far as the record shows, engage in the interstate transportation of the troupes of vaudeville actors, and that while interstate transportation of such actors might or might not become an incident or factor in the execution of the contract, such interstate commerce was only incidental, and not a part of the agreement as made between the parties. It was held that this circumstance did not exempt the business done under the contract from state regulation or control. Williams v. Fears, \n179 \nU.S. 270, 274\n, 45 S. L. ed. 186, 188, 21 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 207, were cited. \n\n[239 U.S. 560, 566]\n\u00a0\n The court further found as matter of fact that it was the ordinary business of plaintiff in error to send troupes of actors from one theater to another in the state of Tennessee for the purpose of presenting plays to audiences assembled in each separate theater, and from the revenues derived by means of such performances it received an income, and its compensation arose from acts done in Tennessee in the several theaters where the troupes of actors appeared and performed; that the account sued on showed more than fifty different items, each representing plaintiff in error's share of the revenues received from as many separate and distinct performances by troupes of actors which it caused to appear in defendants' theater alone; and that for the purpose of enlarging and extending its business in Tennessee plaintiff in error had agents who entered that state and made contracts with other theater owners than Catron & Albert; that its articles of association stated its purpose to be to conduct and operate a general theatrical and amusement business, and this purpose it carried out by the establishment of 'circuits' on which were located theaters convenient one to another, and its scheme contemplated the making of contracts with each of these theaters similar to that of Catron & Albert, and the collection of its revenues arising from booking fees and its percentages on actors' salaries; that, in short, it was a middleman, levying tribute from the owners of the houses where amusement was afforded and from the actors whose talents were employed; and that its claim in suit arose out of business thus conducted.\n It is settled that such findings of fact, in ordinary cases other than those arising under the 'contract clause' of the Constitution, are binding upon this court.

But the rule has its exceptions, as, for instance, where there is ground for the insistence that a Federal \n\n[239 U.S. 560, 567]\n\u00a0\n right has been denied as the result of a finding that is without support in the evidence. Southern P. Co. v. Schuyler, \n227 \nU.S. 601, 611\n, 57 S. L. ed. 662, 669, 43 L.R.A.(N.S.) 901, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 277; North Carolina R. Co. v. Zachary, \n232 \nU.S. 248, 259\n, 58 S.

Rep. 717.\n Plaintiff in error makes the point that the findings here are without support in the evidence; but this is not well taken. The evidence is meager,-none having been offered by plaintiff in error,-but there is evidence tending to show business transacted in the state, and it does not clearly appear to have been interstate business. Reference is made to the form of the contract, and especially its fifth paragraph, which states that plaintiff in error is acting solely in the capacity of agent of the theater owner, and is not responsible for failure of artists to fulfil their contracts, nor for any accident or delay preventing them from arriving in Chattanooga when scheduled; but the same paragraph binds plaintiff in error to 'use every precaution to see that artists fulfil their contracts.' Moreover, the prohibition of the statute, which, as construed and applied by the courts of Tennessee in a line of cases, renders illegal the contracts of foreign corporations carrying on business without complying with the laws applicable thereto, and debars such corporations from suing in the state courts thereon (Cary-Lombard Lumber Co. v. Thomas, 92 Tenn. 587, 593, 22 S. W. 743; New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. Kennedy, 96 Tenn. 711, 714, 36 S. W. 709; Harris v. Water & Light Co. 108 Tenn. 245, 67 S. W. 811; Advance Lumber Co. v. Moore, 126 Tenn. 313, 148 S. W. 212), was evidently established as a matter of public policy, not so much for the benefit of parties sued as in the interest of the people at large; and the question is not so much-What was agreed to be done? as-What was done?\n There being adequate support in the record for the finding of the supreme court of the state that plaintiff in error was doing business in the state, other than inter- \n\n[239 U.S. 560, 568]\n\u00a0\n state commerce, without complying with the statute quoted, the contentions based upon the commerce clause and the due process of law clause alike must fall. For the authority of the state to restrict the right of a foreign corporation to engage in business within its limits or to sue in its courts, so long as interstate commerce be not thereby burdened, is perfectly well settled.

Stat. 1913,  8657; 36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143.\n Plaintiff in error, who was also plaintiff in the trial court, and we shall so designate him, was in the service of \n\n[241 U.S. 229, 230]\n\u00a0\n the railway company, in interstate commerce, as a fireman. He received injuries while attempting to get on a moving locomotive. He charged negligence against the company and sued for the sum of $20,000 damages. The negligence charged was the causing and permitting to be within dangerous proximity to the tracks of the company a pile of loose cinders over which plaintiff stumbled and slipped, and was drawn under the locomotive.\n The railway company, among other defenses, pleaded the following:\n'That the said plaintiff was guilty of gross contributory negligence in attempting to board the engine with a water cooler filled with water in his arms, and was also guilty of gross contributory negligence in attempting to board the engine from a pile of cinders along the track; and was also guilty of gross contributory negligence in running along the track, and in attempting to board the engine without looking and seeing the pile of cinders, which could have been observed with any caution and care on his part; that the said pile of cinders had been allowed to accumulate in the same manner and in the same place as they were at the time of the accident for many years prior to the accident, and that these facts were well known to the plaintiff, and that he assumed the risk of danger from said pile of cinders, if there was any danger in allowing them to remain there.'\n\n There were two trials of the action. The first trial resulted in a verdict for plaintiff for $12,000, upon which judgment was entered. The judgment was reversed by the supreme court of appeals for error in the instructions.\n Upon the second trial the verdict was for defendant. The court refused to set it aside and grant a new trial, but ordered judgment in accordance therewith. The supreme court of appeals refused a writ of error and supersedeas, the effect of which was to affirm the judgment of the trial court. \n\n[241 U.S. 229, 231]\n\u00a0\n The facts are practically undisputed. Plaintiff was engaged with a crew in shiftings cars in the railway company's yard at Lawrenceville, Virginia. He descended from the engine at the depot to get drinking water for himself and the engineer. He returned with a can of water to mount the engine, and then as to what took place he testified as follows: 'I came down the railroad road . . . and came across the track on the crossing. At the time the train was pulling out of the last track. So I waited until the train was pulling up there, and aimed to catch it, and when I aimed to catch it I made three or four steps to get on it, you know, and I got to the cinder pile before I knew it, and I tripped, and went under the engine . . . . The cinder pile tripped me.' The train was moving 'just about as fast as anybody could walk; that is, pretty peart walking; not over 3 or 4 miles an hour at the most.' He further testified that it had been customary ever since he had been on the road 'for the trainmen to get on and off the engine when it was going that way;' had seen it done hundreds of times a day and had never seen any rule forbidding it. He was about 7 feet from the cinder pile when he 'aimed to' catch the engine, and the cinder pile was about 18 or 24 inches deep, and he indicated its length to be about as long as the court room and as wide as the distance from himself to a person he indicated. Describing how the cinders caused him to fall, he said they were piled 'right up against the rail' and 'sloped from the rail up. As I caught the engine, I made several steps, and as I hit the cinder pile they commenced miring just like mud, and it caused me to fall, and when I fell in the cinder pile the journal box kept hitting and I couldn't get up. I tried, but I couldn't. . . . Every time I made an effort the cinder pile gave way with me. . . . I fell down behind the cinder pile. The cinder pile was sloping, and I fell down by the journal box, and the train \n\n[241 U.S. 229, 232]\n\u00a0\n was passing, and I rolled down next to the rail.' He further testified that if he had fallen from some other cause, he could have got out of danger; and that, when he started to get on the engine, he was not conscious of any danger from coming in contact with the pile of cinders; that it was not in his mind at all. But he testified: 'I had knowledge of it, of the cinders being there, but I did not know that it was dangerous. I had forgotten them being there at the time. I was watching when I was going to step on the engine-watching my feet, where I was going to step, and was not noticing the cinder pile. . . . It was not in my mind.'\n It is not disputed that it was customary, and had been for eleven or twelve years, for the ashpans of the engine to be cleaned upon the tracks, and the ashes then drawn out from the tracks, and, when a lot had accumulated, taken away. The piles were of irregular height.\n Plaintiff contends that upon this evidence he was entitled to recover under proper instructions, and that the trial court followed the decision of the supreme court of appeals in giving an instruction at the second trial which it had refused to give at the first trial. The instruction is as follow:\n'The court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that the existence of the cinder pile was known to the plaintiff, or that he had been working for the Southern Railway at Lawrenceville for more than a year, and that the cinders had been piled at the same place in the way described by the witnesses for many years prior to the accident, and that the plaintiff had failed to show that he had made complaint or objection on account of the cinder pile, then he assumed the risk of danger from the cinder pile, if there was any danger in it, and the act of Congress approved April 22, 1908, permits this defense, and the jury should find their verdict for the defendant.'

E. 99.] \n\n[241 U.S. 229, 233]\n\u00a0\n This instruction, it is contended, became 'the law of the case' by the decision of the supreme court of appeals, and precluded the instructions which plaintiff asked, and which otherwise would have been correct, it is insisted, and should have been given.\n\n The instructions refused presented these propositions: (1) The unsafe character or condition of the railway was of itself no defense to the injury caused thereby. (2) Knowledge of it by plaintiff might constitute contributory negligence and diminish the amount of recovery. (3) If the company suffered or permitted the cinders to be placed and to accumulate alongside of its main line in dangerous proximity to the railroad track or road, and plaintiff's injury resulted in whole or in part from such negligence, or if the cinders constituted a defect or insufficiency in the railroad track, the verdict should be for plaintiff. (4) Knowledge of the existence of the cinders would not bar recovery, but it might be considered with other evidence in determining whether plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence; and, if guilty, recovery would not be barred, but the amount of recovery would be diminished in proportion to such negligence. (5) To charge plaintiff with contributory negligence he must not only have known of the cinders, but also the danger occasioned by them, or that the danger was so obvious that a man of ordinary prudence would have appreciated it and not have attempted to get upon the engine at the time and under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence.\n The rulings of the trial court and supreme court of appeals upon the instruction given and those refused make the question here and represent the opposing contentions of the parties. The railway company contends that plaintiff's knowledge of the cinder pile and his conduct constituted assumption of risk and a complete defense to the action. The plaintiff, on the other hand, insists that such knowledge and conduct amounted, at the utmost, \n\n[241 U.S. 229, 234]\n\u00a0\n to no more than contributory negligence, and should not have barred recovery, though it might have reduced the amount of recovery. Indeed, plaintiff goes farther and contends that, whatever might have been the evidence respecting his knowledge or lack of knowledge of the danger, he did not assume the risk if the company was negligent; and, further, that employees' continuance in service with knowledge of a dangerous condition and without complaint does not bar recovery under the act of Congress. He concedes, however, that he encounters in opposition to his contentions the ruling in Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, \n233 U.S. 492\n, 58 L. ed. 1062, L.R.A.1915C, 1, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475, 8 N. C. C. A. 834, and therefore asks a review of that case, asserting that 'the considerations upon which the true construction of the act depends were not suggested to the court.'\n The argument to sustain the assertion and to present what he deems to be the true construction of the act is elaborate and involved. It would extend this opinion too much to answer it in detail. He does not express his contention in any pointed proposition. He makes it through a comparison of the sections of the act, and insists that to retain the common-law doctrine of the assumption of risk is to put the 4th section in conflict with the other sections. The basis of the contention is that the act was intended to be punitive of negligence, and does not cast on the employees of carriers the assumption of risk of any condition or situation caused by such negligence. This is manifest, it is insisted, from the provisions of the 3d section of the act, which provides that the contributory negligence of the employee 'shall not bar a recovery;' and of the 5th section, which precludes the carrier from exempting itself from liability. This purpose is executed, and can only be executed, it is urged, by construing the words of  4 (which we shall presently quote) to apply to 'the ordinary risks inherent in the business,-the unavoidable risks which are intrinsic not- \n\n[241 U.S. 229, 235]\n\u00a0\n withstanding the performance by the carrier of its personal duties. They do not include the 'secondary and ulterior' risks arising from abnormal dangers due to the employer's negligence.' And, further: 'The object of this section was not to adopt by implication the common-law defense of assumption of risk of such abnormal dangers. Its object was in express terms to exclude the defense which, before the passage of the act, was available to the carrier in determining what are the 'risks of his employment' assumed by the employee.'\n These, then, are the considerations which plaintiff says were not submitted to the court in the Horton Case, and which he urges to support his contention that assumption of risk has been abolished absolutely.\n We are unable to concur. The contention attributes to Congress the utmost confusion of thought and language, and makes it express one meaning when it intended another.\n The language of  4 demonstrates its meaning. It provides that in any action brought by an employee he 'shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment in any case where the violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee.' It is clear, therefore, that the assumption of risk as a defense is abolished only where the negligence of the carrier is in violation of some statute enacted for the safety of employees. In other cases, therefoer, it is retained. And such is the ruling in the Horton Case, made upon due consideration and analysis of the statute and those to which it referred. It was said: 'It seems to us that  4, in eliminating the defense of assumption of risk in the cases indicated, quite plainly evidences the legislative intent that in all other cases such assumption shall have its former effect as a complete bar to the action.' And there was a comparison made of  4 with the other \n\n[241 U.S. 229, 236]\n\u00a0\n sections, and the relation and meaning of each determined, and the preservation by the statute of the distinction between assumption of risk and contributory negligence, which was pronounced 'simple' although 'sometimes overlooked.' Cases were cited in which the distinction was recognized and applied (p. 504).\n It is, however, contended that the conditions of the application of assumption of risk were not established, and that 'to charge a servant with assumption of risk the evidence (1) must show that he was 'chargeable with knowledge of the material conditions which were the immediate cause of his injury,' and (2) must establish his 'appreciation of the dangers produced by the abnormal conditions.\" The testimony of plaintiff is adduced to show that these conditions did not exist in his case.\n He admitted a knowledge of the 'material conditions,' and it would be going very far to say that a fireman of an engine who knew of the custom of depositing cinders between the tracks, knew of their existence, and who attempted to mount an engine with a vessel of water in his hands holding 'not over a gallon,' could be considered as not having appreciated the danger and assumed the risk of the situation because he had forgotten their existence at the time and did not notice them. We think his situation brought him within the rule of the cases. Gila Valley, G. & N. R. Co. v. Hall, \n232 \nU.S. 94, 102\n, 58 S. L. ed. 521, 524, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229.\n It is objected, however, that instruction A, 'viewed wholly with reference to common-law principles,' is erroneous in that it omitted to state as an element the appreciation by plaintiff of the danger of the situation as necessary to his assumption of risk. But that objection was not made at the trial. The objection made was general, that the instruction did 'not correctly state the common-law doctrine of assumption of risk.' It was therefore very indeterminate, and we cannot say that the court considered that it was directed to the omission \n\n[241 U.S. 229, 237]\n\u00a0\n to express or to bring into prominence the appreciation by plaintiff of the danger he incurred.\n The instruction was refused by the trial court upon objection by plaintiff. It was considered by the supreme court of appeals, and plaintiff contended against it there only upon the ground that the assumption of risk was not available as a defense under the act of Congress. He made the contention there that he does here, and which we have already considered, that the act of Congress precludes the defense of assumption of risk of any condition or situation caused by the negligence of a carrier. And this was the full extent of plaintiff's contention. Had he made the specific one now made, the supreme court of appeals would have dealt with it, for the opinion of the court shows a clear recognition of the elements necessary to the doctrine of assumption of risk, and the trial court as well must have understood them; and we cannot suppose that the court discerned in plaintiff's general objection the specification which he now contends was necessary, and which it was error to refuse.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","94":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHNSON v. RIDDLE(1916)\nNo. 161\nArgued: January 12, 1916Decided: March 20, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 467, 468]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. B. Ames and Alger Melton for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 467, 469]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph W. Bailey, C. B. Stuart, A. C. Cruce, and W. A. Ledbetter for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action of ejectment, commenced before the admission of Oklahoma as a state, in the United States court for the southern district of the Indian Territory, and brought to a conclusion in the state courts. There have been many changes of interest pendente lite, and corresponding changes of parties. The original plaintiffs were Riddle, now defendant in error, and one Cook, whose interest Riddle has since acquired. The interests of the original defendants have been acquired by plaintiffs in error through mesne conveyances that will be stated below. The subject of the action is a town lot in the town of Chickasha, in the Chickasaw district of the Choctaw Nation, to which plaintiff claimed title by purchase under the town-site provisions of the Atoka Agreement with the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes, found in the act of Congress known as the Curtis act (June 28, 1898, chap. 517, 30 Stat. at L. 495, 505, 508), followed by a patent executed, after the commencement of the action, in accordance with the supplemental agreement with the same tribes (act of July 1, 1902, chap. 1362,  51, 32 Stat. at L. 641, 653), and \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 470]\n\u00a0\n set up in a supplemental complaint. The defendants admitted the legal title to be in Riddle, but by cross complaint sought to have him declared a trustee for their benefit and decreed to convey the title to them. A judgment refusing to declare such a trust, and awarding the lot to Riddle, was affirmed by the supreme court of Oklahoma (41 Okla. 759, 139 Pac. 1143 ), and the case is brought here, under  237, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1214], upon the ground that the decision was against rights set up by plaintiffs in error under the provisions of the Agreement.\n The facts are as follows: Some years prior to the making of the Agreement, one Fitzpatrick, a white man not entitled to citizenship in any Indian tribe, made a lease of the lot in controversy, then vacant and unimproved, to one Barnhart, who went into possession and erected a substantial house and other improvements, which were to belong to him, subject to the payment of a ground rent to Fitzpatrick. There is nothing to show what right Fitzpatrick claimed, or that in fact he had any right to seize upon vacant tribal lands and contract concerning them as he did. In the year 1897, Barnhart sold the improvements and transferred the possession of the lot to one Ellis, who entered into possession and made further improvements. About April 1, 1898, Ellis refused to pay rent, and on July 7, in the same year, Fitzpatrick brought a suit for unlawful detainer against him in the United States court, alleging, in an amended complaint filed in February, 1899, that he desired possession for the purpose of being able to place upon the lot such improvements as would protect his right to the land under the provisions of the Agreement. Fitzpatrick prevailed in the United States court, and, on appeal, in the court of appeals for the Indian Territory (Ellis v. Fitzpatrick, 3 Ind. Terr. 656, 64 S. W. 567), and also in the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit, whose decision was rendered October 27, 1902 (55 C. C. A. 260, 118 Fed. 430). \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 471]\n\u00a0\n Meanwhile Elis retained posession by means of a supersedeas bond.\n In February, 1902, the town-site commission for the Chickasaw Nation, organized pursuant to the provisions of the Atoka Agreement, visited Chickasha for the purpose of appraising town lots and awarding them to persons having the preferential right to purchase under the terms of the Agreement. Ellis having conveyed his rights to Riddle and Cook, the lot was scheduled to them, and on June 12, 1902, they were notified that they had the right to purchase it. A week later they availed themselves of this right by paying to the United States Indian agent the proper percentage of the appraised value to make up the full purchase price of the lot, and took from him a proper receipt.\n Pending the unlawful detainer suit, Fitzpatrick conveyed whatever interest he had in the lot to a Mrs. Cross, and she conveyed an undivided half interest to one Bourland. In January, 1903, after the decision of the circuit court of appeals, Bourland and Cross obtained possession of the lot with the improvements, and in the following month the present action of ejectment was commenced by Riddle and Cook against Fitzpatrick and the persons in possession. Thereafter Bourland and Cross conveyed their interest to E. B. and H. B. Johnson, the present plaintiffs in error, and they were substituted as defendants. Riddle bought the interest of Cook, and thus became the sole plaintiff. Pending the action, a contest was instituted, either by Bourland and Cross or by the Johnsons, against Riddle and Cook, concerning the award and scheduling of the lot to the latter. The town-site commission having been abolished by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to act of March 3, 1905, chap. 1479, 33 Stat. at L. 1048, 1059, the contest was heard before the United States Indian inspector assigned to the Indian Territory, upon whom this duty was imposed by regulations approved \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 472]\n\u00a0\n by the Secretary. Rep. Ind. Inspec. 1905, pp. 5, 22, 23; House Doc. No. 5, 59th Cong. 1st Sess. vol. 19, pp. 705, 722, 723. The inspector made full findings of fact, and in an elaborate opinion decided in favor of contestees. Upon appeal this decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and upon appeal to the Secretary of the Interior it was again affirmed. These decisions proceeded upon findings to the effect that, at the time of the ratification of the Atoka Agreement and at the time the town site of Chickasha was laid out by the town-site commission, and when the plats prepared by the commission were finally approved by the Secretary of the Interior, Ellis was the owner of permanent, substantial, and valuable improvements, other than fences, tillage, and temporary houses, on said lot; that none of these improvements was in any way in issue in the unlawful detainer suit, and Ellis's ownership of them was not denied or disputed, but, on the contrary, was admitted by Fitzpatrick in his pleadings, and they were in no way adjudicated upon in that suit; that Riddle and Cook afterwards purchased the improvements from Ellis, and having received notice from the townsite commission, as already mentioned, of their right to purchase the lot under the provisions of the Atoka Agreement, they forwarded to the United States Indian agent the proper percentage of the appraisement to make up the full purchase price of the lot, and received his receipt for the same. After the final determination of the contest before the Department of the Interior, a patent was issued to Riddle and his associate, dated in May, 1907\n\n\n The Atoka Agreement between the United States and the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes, negotiated April 23, 1897, amended by  29 of the Curtis act (June 28, 1898, chap. 517, 30 Stat. at L. 495, 505), and thereby submitted for ratification by the members of the tribes, was ratified by a majority of votes at a special election held on August 24, \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 473]\n\u00a0\n 1898, the result of which was ascertained and proclaimed on August 30th by a board of commissioners for that purpose, designated by the act, and the agreement thus became effective. (See 6th Ann. Rep. Dawes Comm., September 1, 1899, House Doc. No. 5, 56th Cong. 1st Sess. vol. 19, p. 9; Homer's Const. and Laws of Chickasaw Nation, 1899, p. 420.) It contains provisions respecting town sites (30 Stat. at L. 508, chap. 517), of which the pertinent portions are set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Regulatory provisions, embodied in an act of May 31, \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 474]\n\u00a0\n 1900 (chap. 598, 31 Stat. at L. 221, 237, 238), were assented to by the Choctaws and Chickasaws in the supplemental agreement (act of July 1, 1902, chap. 1362, 32 Stat. at L. 641, 652), and other regulations were thereby added. Authority to appraise town lots, improved or unimproved, to ascertain the ownership and value of the improvements, and to dispose of the lots in conformity to the provisions of the Agreement, was thereby conferred upon the town-site commission, subject to the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior. (See Ross v. Stewart, \n227 \nU.S. 530, 534\n, 57 S. L. ed. 626, 628, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 345.) Their unfinished duties were devolved upon the Secretary by the act of 1905, under whose authority the Indian inspector acted, as already shown. The supreme court of Oklahoma therefore was correct in holding that the findings of the inspector respecting matters of fact, affirmed on final appeal by the Secretary, were binding upon the courts, in the absence of gross mistake or fraud (neither of which is here present), and that the judicial inquiry is limited to determining whether there was clear error of law that resulted in awarding the preferential right of purchase, and ultimately issuing the patent, to the wrong party. Johnson v. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72, 85, 20 L. ed. 485, 487; Shepley v. Cowan, \n91 \nU.S. 330, 340\n, 23 S. L. ed. 424, 427; Marquez v. Frisbie, \n101 \nU.S. 473, 476\n, 25 S. L. ed. 800, 801; Gonzales v. French, \n164 \nU.S. 338, 342\n, 41 S. L. ed. 458, 459, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 102; Ross v. Day, \n232 \nU.S. 110, 116\n, 58 S. L. ed. 528, 529, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 233.\n Since the findings are to the effect that the improvements upon the lot were owned by Ellis, and by defendant in error through a purchase from him, the contentions of the plaintiffs in error are reduced to these: that the decision of the Indian inspector, approved by the Secretary of the Interior, to the effect that the Atoka Agreement terminated the relation of Landlord and tenant, was based upon an erroneous construction of the Agreement, and ignored the equities of the landlord as against the tenant; that under a correct construction of the provision permitting the owner of the improvements to buy a town lot \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 475]\n\u00a0\n at a fraction of the appraised value, a tenant who wrongfully withheld possession of such a lot from his landlord, thereby preventing him from erecting improvements thereon, could not acquire title to the lot as against the landlord; and that a tenant who, under the provisions of the Agreement, but in violation of the rights of his landlord, has acquired a deed for such a lot, holds the title as trustee for the landlord.\n The Atoka Agreement of course is to be read in the light of the conditions out of which it arose. The Choctaw Indians acquired the territory in question under a treaty with the United States made at Dancing Rabbit Creek in the year 1830 (7 Stat. at L. 333). In accordance with the provisions of the treaty, and pursuant to authority conferred by act of May 28, 1830 (chap. 148,  3, 4 Stat. at L. 412), a patent was issued by the President of the United States, March 23, 1842, granting the land to the Choctaw Nation, 'in fee simple to them and their descendants, to inure to them, while they shall exist as a nation and live on it, liable to no transfer or alienation, except to the United States, or with their consent.' (Durant's Const. & Laws of Choctaw Nation, 1894, p. 31.) In 1837 the Choctaws entered into a treaty with the Chickasaws, by which the latter were priviledged to form a district within the limits of the Choctaw country, 'to be held on the same terms that the Choctaws now hold it. except the right of disposing of it, which is held in common with the Choctaws and Chickasaws.' This received the approval of the President and Senate of the United States. 11 Stat. at L. 573, 575. In the year 1855 a new treaty was made between the United States and these tribes (11 Stat. at L. 611), by which the boundaries of their country were defined and the United States guaranteed the lands embraced within the specified limits 'to the members of the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes, their heirs and successors, to be held in common; so that \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 476]\n\u00a0\n each and every member of either tribe shall have an equal, undivided interest in the whole; Provided, however, no part thereof shall ever be sold without the consent of both tribes; and that said land shall revert to the United States if said Indians and their heirs become extinct, or abandon the same.' The westerly part of the country was established as a district for the Chickasaws, the easterly part for the Choctaws. After the Civil War, and in the year 1866, a new treaty was made, by the 11th article of which it was recited that the land described in the treaty of 1855 'is now held by the members of said nations in common, under the provisions of the said treaty.' 14 Stat. at L. 769, 774. A plan for a survey, division, and allotment of the land was proposed by the same article, but this came to naught because of the nonassent of the Choctaw people. Woodward v. DeGraffenried, \n238 \nU.S. 284, 294\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1310, 1318, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 764. Thus matters remained until, in the course of time, the influx of white people into this and other parts of the Indian Territory created a new situation of great complexity, calling for a readjustment of the affairs of the Five Civilized Tribes. In 1893 the Dawes Commission was appointed, under authority of an act of Congress ( chap. 209,  16, 27 Stat. at L. 645), to enter into negotiations with those tribes for the purpose of extinguishing the tribal titles to lands. The annual reports of the Commission, a reference list of which is printed in \n238 U.S. 296\n, give a complete and instructive account of its labors. The first of these reports, dated November 20, 1894, shows that among the original propositions submitted to the several tribes as a basis of negotiations it was suggested that town sites should be the subject of special agreements, such as would secure to the Indians and to investors 'a just protection and adjustment of their respective rights.' In explanation it was stated: 'There are towns in the Territory ranging in population from a few people to 5,000 inhabitants. Nearly all of \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 477]\n\u00a0\n them are noncitizens. . . . Many large and valuable stone, brick, and wooden buildings have been erected by non-citizens of these towns, and the lots on which they stand are worth many thousands of dollars. These town sites are not susceptible of division among the Indians, and the only practicable method of adjusting the equities between the tribes who own the sites and those who constructed the buildings is to appraise the lots without the improvements and the improvements without the lots and allow the owners of the improvements to purchase the lots at the appraised value, or to sell lot and improvements, and divide the money according to the appraisement.' House Ex. Doc. pt. 5, 53d Cong. 3d Sess. vol. 14, pp. lxii., lxv.\n The first agreement to be negotiated by the Commission was with the Choctaws under date December 18, 1896, but the Chickasaws refused to concur in this, and another was negotiated at Atoka, April 23, 1897, with both tribes. In its original form it is appended to the Fourth Report of the Commission, dated october 11, 1897 (House Doc. No. 5, 55th Cong. 2d Sess. vol. 12, pp. cxvii., cxxii.). It provided that a town-site commission should be appointed for each of the two nations; that each existing town site should be laid out and platted, and that 'each lot on which permanent, substantial, and valuable improvements, other than fences, tillage, and temporary houses, have been made, shall be valued by the Commission . . . at the price a fee-simple title to the same would bring in the market at the time the valuation is made, but not to include in such value the improvements thereon. The owner of the improvements on each lot shall have the right to buy the same at 62 1\/2 per cent of the said market value, within sixty days from date of notice served on him that such lot is for sale.' It further provided that if the owner of the improvements should fail to purchase, the lot with improvements should be sold at auction, the \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 478]\n\u00a0\n purchaser to pay the price to the owner of the improvements, less 62 1\/2 per cent of the appraised value of the lot, which was to be paid into the United States Treasury for the benefit of the Indians. This agreement, with some amendments, was ratified by Congress in  29 of the Curtis act, and afterwards ratified by the voters of the two tribes, as already mentioned. The provision as to purchase of town lots was amended only by giving to the owner of the improvements the right to buy one residence and one business lot at 50 per centum and the remainder of such improved property at 62 1\/2 per centum, if the appraised market value.\n The same act contained, in its 15th section (30 Stat. at L. 500, chap. 517) a provision for the appointment of a town-site commission for each of the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Cherokee tribes; allowing 'the owner of the improvements upon any town lot, other than fencing, tillage, or temporary buildings,' to deposit in the United States Treasury one half of the appraised value of the lot, excluding improvements, as a tender to the tribe of the purchase money for the lot; and permitting improved lots to be sold at auction if the owner of the improvements thereon failed to deposit the purchase-money within a limited time, in which case the purchaser at auction might, by appropriate proceedings in the United States court, require the owner of the improvements to either accept their appraised value or remove the improvements from the lot. The same section provided for the sale of unimproved lots, the purchase-money to be deposited with like effect as in the case of improved lots; and authorized the tribes to make deeds to the purchasers conveying the title to such town lots, whereupon the purchase-money was to become the property of the tribe. These provisions would appear to have been superseded, as to the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes, by their acceptance \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 479]\n\u00a0\n of the Atoka Agreement, and are mentioned only to show that in  15, as in the Agreement, it was the owner of the improvements, and he alone, who was recognized as entitled to be considered in the sale of the town lots.\n It is not necessary to say that the Agreement, when thus ratified by Congress and by the tribes, became the law of the land, and superseded all customs, if such there were, that had sanctioned the making of leases to noncitizens. By its terms towns, so far as they had been established within the domain of the tribes, were recognized, and provision was made for platting them, and for selling the lots, both improved and unimproved, the proceeds to become the property of the tribes. It was recognized that the money expended by white men in constructing the buildings and other permanent improvements had increased the value not only of the improved lots, but of all lands within the town; and hence a preferential right of purchase was conferred upon 'the owner of the improvements on each lot.' But there is nothing in the history of the matter, any more than in the language employed, to give the least countenance to the suggestion that prior rights of occupancy were intended to be recognized in this Agreement. Ownership of improvements actually upon the soil was adopted as the sole foundation of the newly conferred right to acquire title to the soil itself. And these improvements must be 'permanent, substantial, and valuable improvements, other than fences, tillage, and temporary houses.' The exclusion of these latter, indicative merely of occupancy, is highly significant.\n The provisions of the Agreement respecting the sale of town lots could not be carried into effect without terminating existing rights of occupancy, if such there were, saving as these coincided with the ownership of permanent improvements. Hence, if Fitzpatrick had any right to the soil, it came to an end either when the Agreement took effect in August, 1898, or, at latest, when its town-site provisions \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 480]\n\u00a0\n were put in operation at Chickasha. It is insisted that Ellis, as tenant, was estopped to deny his landlord's title, and that Riddle is in no better case. Blight v. Rochester, 7 Wheat. 535, 547, 5 L. ed. 516, 519. But a tenant is not estopped to show that his landlord's title has expired or has been terminated by operation of law. England ex dem. Syburn v. Slade, 4 T. R. 682; Blake v. Foster, 8 T.

Rep. 498.\n The argument that Ellis, by withholding possession of the lot from Fitzpatrick, prevented him from erecting improvements such as would have satisfied the requirements of the Atoka Agreement so as to confer upon Fitzpatrick the preferential right to purchase the lot, and hence that Ellis and those claiming under him are estopped to purchase the land for themselver, and must be held to have acquired it in trust for Fitzpatrick and those claiming under him, cannot prevail. The facts do not show that Ellis's refusal to pay rent, and his resistance to the forcible entry and detainer suit, were other than bona fide. Nor does it appear that Fitzpatrick, even before the Atoka Agreement, had any right of possession of the land as against the Indians. So far as the facts appear, he had no rights at all, except as against the tenant, and against him only because of the estoppel. In order to show that the tenant, by withholding possession, deprived the landlord of the opportunity of exercising a valuable right, it must be made to appear that, with the tenant out of the way, the right would have existed. But, if Ellis had given up possession, Fitzpatrick would have had no more right than any other white man to enter and erect improvements,-that is to say, none at all. At most, he would have had a mere opportunity, without right, \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 481]\n\u00a0\n and the deprivation of this cannot furnish a foundation for impressing a trust upon the title afterwards acquired by Ellis's grantee by direct purchase from the owners of the paramount title. Even were it made to appear that there was error in adjudging the title to the patentee, this would not raise a trust in favor of the contestant unless he could show that by the law, properly administered, the title ought to have been awarded to him. Bohall v. Dilla, \n114 \nU.S. 47, 51\n, 29 S. L. ed. 61, 63, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 782; Sparks v. Pierce, \n115 \nU.S. 408, 413\n, 29 S. L. ed. 428, 429, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 102.\n What, then, was the nature of Fitzpatrick's equity? Under the facts found, both he and Ellis were trespassers upon the lands of the Indians, in disregard of rights secured to the latter by treaty with the United States, and in violation of  2118, Rev. Stat. \n1\n The lease created a mere estoppel between trespassers. The rights, if they may be called rights, of lessor and lessee alike, were terminated by the force of the Agreement. Individual ownership of the land originated with that instrument, and can be only such as by its terms was created. It was competent for Congress, or for the Indian tribes, with the concurrence of Congress, to deal as they deemed proper with the practical situation resulting from the building of towns by white men within their borders. They chose to confer a preferential right of purchase, at a discount from the appraised value, not upon the 'occupant,' or 'possessor,' or 'landlord,' or 'tenant,' but upon 'the owner of the improvements' other than those of a temporary nature. This did not cut off any pertinent equity, but it rendered all equities impertinent except such as related to the ownership of the improvements.\n The Atoka Agreement, while accepting existing improvements of a substantial nature as part consideration for the purchase of town lots, contained no recognition of legitimacy in the previous occupation of the soil by white men, nor any official ratification of their intrusion upon the Indian lands. It laid aside, as immaterial, the question \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 482]\n\u00a0\n whether improvements had been constructed with or without rightful possession of the land. In this respect it session of the land. In this respect it differed from the Original Creek Agreement of March 8, 1900 ( act of March 1, 1901, chap. 676, 31 Stat. at L. 861, 866), the proposed Cherokee agreement of April 9, 1900 (act of March 1, 1901, chap. 675, 31 Stat. at L. 848, 853), which failed of ratification by the tribe (8th Ann. Rep. Dawes Comm. Oct. 1, 1901; House Dec. No. 5, 57th Cong. 1st Sess. vol. 24, p. 11), and the Cherokee agreement of July 1, 1902 (chap. 1375, 32 Stat. at L. 716, 723), which was ratified by the tribe (10th Ann. Rep. Dawes Comm. Sept. 30, 1903; House Doc. No. 5, 58th Cong. 2d Sess. vol. 20, p. 115).\n If Fitzpatrick had had any equitable right or interest in the improvements upon the lot in controversy, a very different question would be presented. But he had none.\n We are referred to two decisions of the United States court of appeals for the Indian Territory that are said to uphold the legal validity of grants of leasehold interests in lands in the Choctaw and Chickasaw country prior to the Atoka Agreement. Kelly v. Johnson (1897) 1 Ind. Terr. 184, 189, 39 S. W. 352, 354; G. W. Walker Trading Co. v. Grady Trading Co. (1897) 1 Ind. Terr. 191, 196-198, 39 S. W. 354, 356. These cases, however, go no further than to hold that a possessory right might pass by transfer from a citizen of one of the Indian tribes to a noncitizen, and would protect the latter against forcible entry by others not showing a better right to the possession, nor acting under authority of the tribe, and that a lease of such lands with improvements estopped the lessee to question the lessor's title. See also Wilson v. Owens (1897) 1 Ind. Terr. 163, 38 S. W. 976, affirmed in 30 C. C. A. 257, 57 U. S. App. 500, 86 Fed. 571; Hockett v. Alston, 49 C. C. A. 180, 110 Fed. 910, reversing s. c. 3 Ind. Terr. 432, 58 S. W. 675; Williams v. Works, 4 Ind. Terr. 587, 76 S. W. 246; Fraer v. Washington, 60 C. C. A. 194, 125 Fed. 280. These decisions leave untouched the authority of Congress, with \n\n[240 U.S. 467, 483]\n\u00a0\n or without the consent of the tribe, to terminate all possessory interests and dispose of the fee in any manner deemed proper.\n Much reliance is placed upon the decision of this court in Rector v. Gibbon, \n111 U.S. 276\n, 28 L. ed. 427, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 605, which turned upon the effect of an act of Congress in relation to the Hot Springs Reservation in the state of Arkansas (act of March 3, 1877, chap. 108, 19 Stat. at L. 377). The statute was passed to relieve the peculiar hardship resulting from a decision of the court of claims, affirmed by this court ( Hot Springs Cases, \n92 \nU.S. 698, 713\n, 715 S., 716, 23 L. ed. 690, 696, 697), holding invalid, for reasons more or less technical, certain land titles set up against the United States, some of them under claims of pre-emption and one under a New Madrid location, followed in each case by long years of possession. Rector v. Gibbon construed the legislation in the light of the circumstances out of which it arose, and so as to relieve those who had made improvements or claimed possession under the titles that had been found defective. It has no proper bearing upon the questions presented in the case at bar. Lamb v. Davenport, 18 Wall. 307, 21 L. ed. 759; Atherton v. Fowler, \n96 U.S. 513\n, 24 L. ed. 732; and Trenouth v. San Francisco, \n100 U.S. 251\n, 25 L. ed. 626, cited by plaintiffs in error, are likewise aside from the point.\n It is, perhaps, unnecessary to mention that the matter at issue here is not concluded by the decision in Eillis v. Fitzpatrick, 3 Ind. Terr. 656, 64 S. W. 567, s. c. affirmed in 55 C. C. A. 260, 118 Fed. 430, for that case concerned only the right of possession as between landlord and tenant, and Ellis's ownership of the improvements was admitted in the pleadings. The legal or equitable title to the soil was not involved.\n From the views above expressed, it results that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Town Sites.

The circuit court of appeals reversed a judgment recovered by the plaintiff, and ordered judgment for the defendant. 135 C. C. A. 139, 219 Fed. 397. This writ of error was taken out before the passage of the act of January 28, 1915, chap. 22,  4, 38 Stat. at L. 803, 804.\n The facts are these: On May 9, 1910, the Warren Construction Company, the bankrupt, had contracted to do some construction for a railroad company, receiving monthly payments on account, and agreeing that if at any time there should be evidence of any lien for which the railroad might become liable, and which was chargeable to the Warren Company, the railroad might retain an amount sufficient to indemnify it. Should there prove to be such a claim after the payments were made, the Warren Company agreed to refund all moneys the railroad might be compelled to pay in discharging any lien made obligatory in consequence of the Warren Company's default. The Warren Company gave a bond with sureties for the performance of this contract. Later it made a \n\n[241 U.S. 160, 163]\n\u00a0\n written subcontract with the Root Manufacturing Company for materials, in which the Root Company in the fullest terms renounced all lien on its own behalf, and contracted that all under it should do the same. Monthly payments were to be made on account and final payment within forty days after the contract was 'fulfilled.'\n In 1911 the Root Company notified the railroad that it was not being paid, and that it would not furnish more material unless the railroad would see that it was paid. The railroad gave the assurance and the Root Company continued to furnish the materials called for by its contract. Seemingly the payments continued to be unsatisfactory, and on November 18, 1911, after the Root Company had performed its contract there was unpaid $ 12,895.34. On November 25, 1911, the Root Company filed statutory notices of its intention to hold a lien upon the railroad's property for the amount then due. On January 12, 1912, after conferences of all parties concerned, a contract was made between the railroad, the Warren Company and its sureties, reciting controversy as to whether the Warren Company's contract had been performed, the filing of claims for liens and attachment suits for more than the sum admitted by the railroad to be due, and the railroad's assertion of its right against the surety companies. This contract fixed $42,000 as a sum to be paid by the railroad in full settlement of the mutual claims between it and the Warren Company, and provided that, with $20,000 to be furnished by the surety companies, the sum should be put into the hands of named trustees, 'to be used in paying all lienable claims' growing out of the construction contract. If the fund was not sufficient to pay lienable claims in full, the surety companies were to furnish the additional money necessary. After all lienable claims were paid, the balance, if any, of the fund was to be paid first to reimburse the surety companies for their contribution, \n\n[241 U.S. 160, 164]\n\u00a0\n and after that to the Warren Company, subject to such attachments as might be filed against the sum.\n On April 10, 1912, a written contract was made between the railroad, the sureties, the Warren Company, and the Root Company, which recited the claim of the Root Company and that the railroad had money in its hands, held back under its contract with the Warren Company, for the purpose of protecting the road against liens, and agreed that $6,447.67 should be paid to the Root Company by way of compromise, that the Root Company should assign its claim to the trustee under the former instrument, surrendering to the Warren Company notes for 60 per cent of its claim, and that the trustee should reassign to the Root Company the unpaid portion of its claim when attachments against the fund had been disposed of. The payment was made the same day, and the Root Company executed a release, as agreed. The sum was a larger percentage than will be received by the unsecured creditors of the Warren Company, but a smaller one than that received by any other subcontractors with a lien. The petition in bankruptcy was filed on July 18, 1912, and the above payment was a preference if it stood as a payment to an unsecured creditor in the circumstances on the date when it was made.\n The circuit court of appeals held that the instrument of January 12 created an equitable lien that justified the payment, although it was of opinion that the lien asserted by the Root Company could not have been enforced. The plaintiff in error contends that the provision in favor of 'lienable claims' was confined to those that were secured by a valid lien. We express no opinion as to whether the lien of the Root Company, asserted against the property of the railroad, could have been defeated by its contract with the Warren Company notwithstanding the Warren Company's default. It is enough that we agree with the ultimate view of the circuit court of \n\n[241 U.S. 160, 165]\n\u00a0\n appeals. The agreement of January 12 was intended for practical purposes, to clear the railroad property from claims. It contemplated possible controversies, as it provided for costs, but it did not require that every disputed lien should be fought out to the end. It was understood by the parties to extend to the compromise of claims that stood upon debatable ground, as was shown by the agreement under which the payment was made. It set aside a specific fund in a third hand to that end. All the parties acted in good faith. The $42,000 credited to the Warren Company as retained by the railroad was nearly twice what the railroad admitted to be due, apart from the compromise by which it secured the application of that sum to clearing its land. We are of opinion that there is no reasonable doubt that all parties were justified in the course adopted, that the instrument of January 12 created an equitable lien in favor of all alleged liens which the parties should deem to have color of right, and that the fund being thus appropriated and set aside, it does not matter that the formal ascertainment of the specific beneficiary was made within four months of the bankruptcy proceedings. It was well understood before. The Root Company took part in the preliminary discussions, and there can be no doubt that it was expected by all on January 12 that its claim, however disputed, would have to be dealt with when the fund came to be paid out.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJONES NAT. BANK v. YATES(1916)\nNo. 163\nArgued: Decided: April 3, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 541, 542]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John Jacob Thomas, Lionel C. Burr, and Arthur B. Hayes for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Frank E. Bishop and Frank M. Hall for defendants in error Charles E. Yates and Louisa Hamer.\n Messrs. Halleck F. Rose, John F. Stout, and Arthur R. Wells for defendant in error D. E. Thompson.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 541, 543]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Capital National Bank of Lincoln, Nebraska, suspended payment on January 21, 1893. The plaintiffs in error were unpaid depositors and brought these actions against directors of the bank to recover damages attributed to false representations of the bank's condition. With their denials of breach of duty, the defendants averred that their liability, if any, was to be determined \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 544]\n\u00a0\n by the provisions of the national bank act. Judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, upon the verdict of a jury, was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. Yates v. Jones Nat. Bank, 74 Neb. 734, 105 N. W. 287. It was held that the actions were for deceit, at common law, and the judgments were sustained upon that ground. Upon writ of error the judgments were reversed. \n206 \nU.S. 158, 181\n, 51 S. L. ed. 1002, 1015, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638. It was the view of the court, even if it were conceded 'that there was some evidence tending to show the making of alleged written representations other than those contained in the official reports made by the association to the Comptroller of the Currency, and published in conformity to the national bank act, that such latter statements were counted upon in the amended petition and were, if not exclusively, certainly principally, the grounds of the alleged false representations covered by the proof.' Id. p. 171. It was therefore concluded that the recovery had been based upon conduct of the defendants in the discharge of duties imposed by the Federal statute; that, with respect to such conduct, the statute (Rev. Stat.  5239, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9831) furnished an exclusive test of liability; and that this test had not been applied. It was held that responsibility, by the terms of the statute, arose from its violation 'knowingly,' and hence that 'something more than negligence is required; that is, that the violation must in effect be intentional.' Id. pp. 179, 180.\n Upon remand, the petitions were amended, but there was no material change in the nature of the causes of action. By agreement, the several cases were tried together, and trial was had by the court without a jury. Official reports, as published, of the condition of the bank, were introduced in evidence. Two of these (of December 28, 1886, and December 9, 1892) had been annexed to the petition, and the allegations were broad enough to embrace others. It appeared that the official reports of December 28, 1886, December 12, 1888, September 30, \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 545]\n\u00a0\n 1889, July 9, 1891, December 2, 1891, and December 9, 1892, had been attested by the defendant Yates; those of September 25, 1891, and September 30, 1892, by Ellis P. Hamer, the intestate of the defendant, Louisa Hamer; and those of December 28, 1886, August 1, 1887, October 2, 1890, December 19, 1890, and July 9, 1891, by the defendant, David E. Thompson. Each of these statements showed the capital stock intact and also surplus and undivided profits.\n On behalf of the defendants Yates and Hamer, the following special findings among others were requested:\n'III. That neither the defendant Charles E. Yates nor Ellis P. Hamer, the deceased, knowingly violated or knowingly permitted any of the officers, agents, or servants of the Capital National Bank to violate any of the provisions of the national banking act under which said bank operated.\n\n'IV. That neither the defendant Charles E. Yates nor the deceased, Ellis P. Hamer, knowingly participated in or assented to any violation of any of the provisions of said national banking act by any of the officers, agents, or servants of said Capital National Bank.'\n\n'IX. That the defendant Charles E. Yates, in attesting said reports of date December 28, 1886, and December 9, 1892, did not, with actual knowledge thereof or intentionally, make an untrue statement or representation of the assets or liabilities of said Capital National Bank, nor of any of the items of either its assets or liabilities.\n\n'X. That neither the defendant Charles E. Yates nor the deceased Ellis P. Hamer, with actual knowledge or intentionally, made any untrue statement or representation of any or all of the assets of the Capital National Bank in any or all of the statements or reports made to the Comptroller of the Currency and published by said bank, as required by the national banking act, which reports are shown in the testimony in this case.' \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 546]\n\u00a0\n The trial court found 'against each of the defendants and in favor of the plaintiff' respecting the third and fourth requests. On the ninth request, the court answered 'in the negative' as to the report of December 28, 1886, and 'in the affirmative' as to the report of December 9, 1892; and on the tenth request, the court found 'in the affirmative.' These rulings 'in the affirmative' were taken to be findings against these defendants, each of whom at once (on a motion to set aside the findings and for a new trial) filed exceptions,-the defendant Yates stating that the court 'erred in finding against defendant on the ninth request as to report Dec. 9, 1892,' and each of the defendants Yates and Hamer stating that the court 'erred in finding against defendant on the tenth request.'\n\n Among the requests for findings submitted by the defendant Thompson were the following:\n'4. Whether this defendant at any time prior to its failure or suspension had actual personal knowledge that any of the official statements made by the Capital National Bank to the Comptroller of the Currency, and referred to in the petition or the evidence, were in any material respect false and untrue.\n\n'5. Whether this defendant in fact participated in any of the official reports made by the Capital National Bank to the Comptroller of the Currency other than the five several reports dated respectively, December 28, 1886, August 1, 1887, October 2, 1890, and December 19, 1890, and July 9, 1891.\n\n'6. Whether in attesting such of the official reports of the Capital National Bank to the Comptroller of the Currency as are shown to have been attested by him, the defendant acted in good faith.\n\n'7. Whether in attesting such of the official reports of the Capital National Bank to the Comptroller of the Currency as are shown to have been attested by him, the defendant acted fraudulently and with actual personal \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 547]\n\u00a0\n knowledge that such reports or any one of them were in any material respect false and untrue.'\n\n As to the fourth request, the trial court found 'in the affirmative,' and the defendant Thompson filed his objection that the finding was 'not sustained by sufficient evidence' and was 'not consistent with the findings made in response to the sixth and seventh requests.' As to the fifth request, the trial court found 'that the defendant attested only five reports mentioned in said request.' As to the sixth and seventh requests, it was found:\n'Respecting the sixth and seventh requests of the defendant, the court finds that the defendant had no actual personal knowledge of the truth or falsity of the reports made to the Comptroller, attested by him, but in attesting such reports the court finds that the defendant relied upon the statements made to him by the president and cashier of the bank, and without any investigation, and that at the time of attesting such statements the defendant knew that he had no personal knowledge of the truth or falsity of such reports, and that the same were attested recklessly and without performing his duties as a director to ascertain the truth or falsity of such reports before the same were attested by him, and in this respect the court finds that the same were not made in good faith.'\n\n The trial court, upon its own motion, found in each case, as to all the defendants, as follows:\n'The Capital National Bank, at the time it assumed that name and at the time it increased its capital stock to $300,000, had sustained losses greatly in excess of its purported capital stock, and that it never, in fact, had any capital stock, undivided profits, or surplus, and that it was at all times insolvent and so continued up to the time it ceased to do business, on January 21, 1893, at which time its liabilities exceeded its assets by more than a million dollars. \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 548]\n\u00a0\n The court finds that from and after September, 1891, the said Ellis P. Hamer, and the defendants Yates and Thompson, and each of them, had knowledge and knew that the statements, advertisements, and representations of the bank's financial condition and capital stock, both official and unofficial and voluntary, shown by the evidence, were being published in the newspapers and sent to the plaintiff, by the officers of the bank, as alleged in the amended petition, and that they contained the names of all the directors, including said Ellis P. Hamer, and the defendants Yates and Thompson, and purported to be made and published under and by their authority, in their names, and with their sanction and consent.\n\n'The court further finds that the said Ellis P. Hamer and the defendants Yates and Thompson, and each of them, from and after September, 1891, had knowledge and knew said statements, representations, and advertisements aforesaid contained material false representations of the financial condition of said bank, and were in fact false and untrue, as in plaintiff's amended petition alleged, and with knowledge of all of the matters and facts aforesaid they and each of them knowingly permitted, assented to, and allowed the same to be made, published, advertised, and sent to plaintiff, as aforesaid, as in the amended petition alleged. That said statements and advertisements aforesaid showed and represented the bank to be in a sound, solvent, and prosperous financial condition when in fact it was at all times wholly insolvent and unable to pay its liabilities.'\n\n It was further found 'that the allegations of plaintiff's amended petition are true.' The trial court, as to each of the defendants, also set forth its conclusion that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover 'in an action of deceit under the principles of the common law exclusive of the requirements of the national banking act,' and fixed the damages sustained. Motion for a new trial was denied. \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 549]\n\u00a0\n Upon appeal, the judgments in the several cases were reversed by the supreme court of the state, and the actions were dismissed. 93 Neb. 121, 139 N. W. 844, 1135. The appeals were heard by six judges, two of whom dissented from the conclusion reached. Three judges concurred in one opinion (delivered by Hamer, J.), taking the view that the amended petitions contained 'no material additional statement of facts,' that they 'still charge the defendants with making false statements to the Comptroller of the Currency as to the condition of the Capital National Bank, and this is the main foundation or basis for recovery,' and that the plaintiffs 'having failed to allege and prove that the defendants personally knew of, or personally participated in, the acts of the officers of the bank of which they now complain,' were not entitled to recover under the decision of this court as to the rule of liability established by the Federal act. Id. pp. 123, 130. The remaining judge ( Letton, J.), whose concurrence was essential to the reversal, stated his views in a separate opinion. After pointing out that the issues were the same as when the case was presented to this court on the former writ of error, and that this court had held that a Federal question was involved, he said:\n'I agree with the former judgment of this court and that of the several inferior Federal tribunals before which the question was presented that the petitions state a cause of action at common law for deceit, but think this court is bound by the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States. I am also inclined to the view that the evidence would support a judgment upon such a theory of the case. The findings of the district court are to that effect. I am not satisfied they are unsustained by the evidence. The presumption is that they are so sustained; but I have not examined the evidence so critically as would be necessary to determine this, for the reason that, under the holding of the Supreme Court of the United States as to the measure \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 550]\n\u00a0\n of duty and of liability of directors under the banking laws of the United States, I think a case has not been made. For that reason alone, I concur in the conclusion.' Id. p. 131.\n\n The appellees moved for a rehearing, contending, in part, that the court had erred in denying to them 'the right to recover under the national bank laws.' On this motion the court was equally divided and the motion was denied. And these writs of error to review the judgments of reversal and dismissal have been prosecuted.\n\n 1. \nIt is insisted that the writs should be dismissed in the view that the plaintiffs in error sought to enforce liability upon nonfederal grounds and that the Federal question was raised exclusively by the defendants in error. But this objection ignores the nature of the plaintiffs' case. The fact that their petitions did not refer, in terms, to the Federal statute, is not controlling. Thomas v. Taylor, \n224 \nU.S. 73, 78\n, 79 S., 56 L. ed. 673, 676, 677, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403; Grand Trunk Western R. Co. v. Lindsay, \n233 \nU.S. 42, 48\n, 58 S. L. ed. 838, 842, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 168. It was alleged that statements published by the defendants, acting as directors and officers of the bank, with respect to its financial condition, were false, and were known to be false, and were made with intent to deceive plaintiffs and others. Two of these statements- official reports formally attested-were, as we have said, annexed to the petitions. The proof of representations chiefly concerned these reports and others of a similar sort. In contemplation of law, the question upon the case made by the plaintiffs was essentially one as to the liability of these directors for conduct governed by the Federal act. The conclusion of the trial court that there could be a recovery at common law, independent of the Federal statute, did not alter the inherent character of the actions. Recognizing that these must be deemed to rest upon transactions falling within the purview of that statute, and that the plaintiffs' rights must be measured accordingly, the supreme court of the state reversed thejudgments \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 551]\n\u00a0\n and dismissed the actions. Although the defendants alleged in their answers that, if any liability attached to them as directors, it was determined by the Federal act, the construction of which was necessarily involved, this was not, properly speaking, a matter of affirmative defense. What is called the defendants' assertion of Federal right was simply their contention as to the essential elements of the plaintiffs' cause of action. In Thomas v. Taylor, supra, the case was framed in deceit under the common law, but the appellate courts of the state decided 'that it was the facts pleaded, and not the technical designation of the action, which constituted grounds of recovery.' We accepted that decision, saying: 'There is nothing in the national banking laws which precludes such view. Those laws are not concerned with the form of pleadings. They only require that the rule of responsibility declared by them shall be satisfied.' If the plaintiffs' cause of action required the application of the Federal statute in defining the liability of these directors with respect to the acts alleged and proved, the plaintiffs were entitled to its correct application. Their case, as made by their pleadings and proofs, is not to be treated as of one character for the purpose of dismissing it in the state court, and as of another sort for the purpose of denying their right to complain of the dismissal. We conclude that this court has jurisdiction.\n\n 2. \nIt is apparent that there were no findings of fact by the supreme court of the state. The actions being at law and trial by jury being waived, the findings of fact made by the trial court-as we understand the local practice-had 'the same force and effect' as the verdict of a jury. Citizens Ins. Co. v. Herpolsheimer, 77 Neb. 232, 109 N. W. 160; Dorsey v. Wellman, 85 Neb. 262, 122 N. W. 989; Darr v. Kansas City Hay Co. 85 Neb. 665, 124 N. W. 103; Madison Nat. Bank v. Gross, 98 Neb. 684, 154 N. W. 207. It was not a case of a trial de novo upon appeal, as in an equity suit. First Nat. Bank v. Crawford, \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 552]\n\u00a0\n 78 Neb. 665, 111 N. W. 587. But, apart from these considerations, findings of fact by the supreme court would necessarily require the action of a majority of that court, and it is plain that the opinion of the three judges, unaided by the concurrence of the fourth, could not be regarded as embodying such findings. Justice Letton, whose concurrence in the result made the reversal possible, stated specifically the sole ground of his action, and his statement did not purport to be the resolving of questions of fact. After saying that he was inclined to the view that the evidence would support a judgment upon a cause of action at common law for deceit, and that 'the findings of the district court' were 'to that effect,' he added that he was not satisfied that these findings were 'unsustained by the evidence.' He considered the presumption to be that they were 'so sustained,' but he had 'not examined the evidence so critically as would be necessary to determine this,' for the reason that, in view of the holding of this court 'as to the measure of duty and of liability of directors' under the Federal act, he thought that 'a case had not been made.' 'For that reason alone' he concurred in the conclusion.\n It is manifest that this was simply the expression of an opinion with respect to the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs' case. That is, the decisive ruling-upon which the reversal rested-was that, as matter of law, applying the Federal statute, the plaintiffs were not entitled to their recovery. And the judgment as entered upon appeal simply set forth that the court, finding 'error apparent in the record of the proceedings and judgment,' reversed and dismissed.\n In this state of the record, for the purpose of determining whether, in thus reversing the judgments and depriving the plaintiffs of their recovery, the Federal question was wrongly decided, there are two questions to be considered: (a) whether the facts found by the trial court \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 553]\n\u00a0\n justified a recovery under the Federal law, and, if so, (b) whether there was substantial evidence to support these findings, as the duty to decide the Federal question in its very nature involves this further inquiry. Dower v. Richards, \n151 \nU.S. 658, 667\n, 38 S. L. ed. 305, 308, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 452, 17 Mor. Min. Rep. 704; Stanley v. Schwalby, \n162 \nU.S. 255, 277\n, 278 S., 40 L. ed. 960, 967, 968, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 754; Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. C. H. Albers Commission Co. \n223 \nU.S. 573, 591\n, 592 S., 56 L. ed. 556, 565, 566, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 316; Creswill v. Grand Lodge, K. P. \n225 \nU.S. 246, 261\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1074, 1080, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 822; Southern P. Co. v. Schuyler, \n227 \nU.S. 601, 611\n, 57 S. L. ed. 662, 669, 43 L.R.A.(N.S.) 901, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 277; North Carolina R. Co. v. Zachary, \n232 \nU.S. 248, 259\n, 58 S. L. ed. 591, 595, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 159; Carlson v. Washington, \n234 \nU.S. 103, 106\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1237, 1238, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 717.\n\n 3. \nIn addition to the general finding in each case that the allegations of plaintiffs' amended petition were true, we have noted that the court found specially that the bank had sustained losses greatly in excess of its purported capital stock; that it never 'had any capital stock, undivided profits or surplus;' that it 'was at all times insolvent and so continued up to the time it ceased to do business on January 21, 1893,' when 'its liabilities exceeded its assets by more than a million dollars;' and that the published statements shown by the evidence, embracing the official reports to which reference has been made, represented the bank to be 'in a sound, solvent, and prosperous financial condition' when in fact it was 'wholly insolvent and unable to pay its liabilities.' The official reports covered by the findings were those made to the Comptroller of the Currency and published at the times we have mentioned, in pursuance of  5211 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. Stat. 1913,  9774).1 \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 554]\n\u00a0\n While, as pointed out on the former writ of error, the act did not expressly require that these reports 'should contain a 'true' statement of the condition of the association,' yet 'by necessary implication, such is the character of the statement required to be made, and by the like implication the making and publishing of a false report is prohibited.' 206 U. S. p. 177. And as it is plain that the making of these official reports, found to be false, was a violation of the statute, the question is whether the findings made a case within  5239 of the Revised Statutes ( Comp. Stat. 1913,  9831), which provides that where the statute is 'knowingly' violated or is 'knowingly' permitted to be violated, as stated, 'every director who participated in or assented to' such violation shall be liable individually for all damages thereby sustained by 'the association, its shareholders, or any other person,'-a civil liability which may be enforced in the state court. Id. pp. 180, 181.\n As to the directors Yates and Hamer (the former having attested an official report to the Comptroller of the Currency as late as December 9, 1892, and the latter having attested an official report of September 30, 1892), the trial court not only found 'against each of the defendants and in favor of the plaintiff' upon the special requests for findings that these directors did not knowingly participate in the violation of the act, but the trial court also found explicitly that each of these directors 'from \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 555]\n\u00a0\n and after September, 1891,' knew that the official statements as to the bank's financial condition, which were shown by the evidence to have been published, 'contained material false representations of the financial condition of said bank, and were in fact false and unture,' and that these directors, with knowledge 'of all the matters and facts aforesaid,' had 'knowingly permitted, assented to, and allowed the same' to be made and published. The findings as to each of these directors abundantly supported the plaintiffs' recovery within the established rule of liability.\n With respect to the defendant Thompson (the latest official report attested by him being the one of July 9, 1891), we have seen that the court found that he had 'no actual personal knowledge of the truth or falsity' of the reports which he attested, but that in attesting them he 'relied upon the statements made to him by the president and cashier' of the bank 'without any investigation,' and that 'at the time of attesting such statements' he 'knew that he had no personal knowledge' of their truth or falsity, and that they 'were attested recklessly and without performing his duties as a director' to ascertain their truth or falsity before attestation, and in this respect that these reports 'were not made in good faith.' If this finding, fairly construed, did not import more than mere neglect or inattention, it would not be sufficient to sustain a recovery; for Congress did not make negligence the test of liability, but the fact that the act was violated knowingly, although there may be a violation 'in effect intentional,' and therefore within the statute, 'when one deliberately refuses to examine that which it is his duty to examine.' Thomas v. Taylor, \n224 \nU.S. 73, 78\n, 79 S., 56 L. ed. 673, 676, 677, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403. In that case the directors, having been warned by the bank examiner and Comptroller of the doubtful character of certain assets, still represented them to be good; and their reckless report, in disregard of the official direction, was found to have the \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 556]\n\u00a0\n quality of an intentional breach of the defined duty. But in the present case, we are not called upon to determine what should be deemed to be involved in the finding that the attestation of the earlier reports, which were attested by this defendant, was made 'without nay investigation' and 'recklessly.' For there were later reports made on behalf of the bank, and the defendant is not excused simply by the fact that he did not attest them. His liability was not merely with respect to attestation, but for knowingly 'participating in' or 'assenting to' the violation of the act. 206 U. S. pp. 177-179. If the defendant Thompson participated in or assented to the making and publication of the official reports to the Comptroller of the Currency, which were made in the year 1892, knowing that they were false reports, he was liable to the plaintiffs deceived and damaged thereby under the express terms of the statute; and he could not escape this liability simply because, while he thus participated or assented, other directors gave the formal attestation. And the trial court found, not only with respect to Yates and Hamer, but as to the defendant Thompson, that each of them after September, 1891, knew that the official statements as to the condition of the bank, shown by the evidence, were in fact false, and that with knowledge of the facts stated in the findings with respect to the condition of the bank, the defendant Thompson, as well as the others, 'knowingly permitted, assented to, and allowed' the same to be made and published. This was a sufficient finding of the ultimate fact of participation or assent, and constituted an adequate basis for recovery.\n We conclude that the findings of the trial court, in the light of the Federal statute, supported the judgments it entered.\n\n 4. \nThe plaintiffs in error, however, are not entitled to complain of the reversal as a denial of Federal right, even though the judgments were supported by the findings of \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 557]\n\u00a0\n fact made by the trial court, if these findings themselves were not supported by substantial evidence.\n As to the financial condition of the bank, there is no room for controversy. It would be difficult to conceive of a case of more scandalous maladministration than that which the testimony portrays. There was evidence of manipulation of accounts, of fictitious and falsified entries, of fraudulent concealments. It cannot be said that there was serious effort to meet this evidence. There was no attempt to palliate the offenses which it appeared had been committed by the executive officers in the conduct of the bank's affairs. But these directors were not accountants; presumably they relied upon the books as containing accurate items, and there is no basis for the conclusion that they had knowledge of fictitious or falsified entries in the books, or of the fraudulent transactions which such entries were intended to conceal, and which were revealed after the bank failed. With respect to such concealed transactions, we find nothing to show that the directors knowingly participated in, or assented to, a violation of the statute.\n We pass, therefore, to matters of a different sort which lay easily within the ken of the directors. The bank had been incorporated as the Marsh National Bank, in the year 1883, with a capital stock of $100,000. The assets and liabilities of a preceding concern, Marsh Brothers, Mosher , & Company, were transferred to the bank and became its assets and liabilities. In 1884, the name was changed to the Capital National Bank of Lincoln; the capital stock was then increased to $200,000, and in 1886 there was a further increase, making the total capital stock $300,000. Yates, Hamer, and Thompson became directors in 1884, and continued as such until the failure of the bank in January, 1893. There were seven directors in all, including C. W. Mosher, the president. It appears that, at the time of the failure, the bank's assets at their face \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 558]\n\u00a0\n value, as shown by the books, were about $1,031,000. The liabilities, as shown by the books, including capital stock, amounted to about $1,017,000; these seem to have been in face (including liabilities on rediscounts) about $1,760,000. Included in the assets above stated, the amount of $850, 959.86 (in face value) was in bills receivable of which $155,560.84 were classed by the receiver as doubtful and $397,073.63 as worthless. The actual showing on liquidation appears to have been even worse; the total amount realized from the bills receivable (aggregating $850,959.86) was $ 229,520.82, and the total amount realized from all the assets of the bank ( including rediscounted items placed in the hands of the receiver for collection, and excluding stock assessments) seems to have been less than $ 400,000.\n The evidence was that at the time of the failure there were on hand worthless notes of C. W. Mosher, the president, amounting to $85,281.67; of the cashier, R. C. Outcalt, $54,166.96 (less an offset of $570.99); and of the Western Manufacturing Company (signed by E. Hurlburt, Jr., manager ), $235,000. This concern was apparently but another name for C. W. Mosher; the testimony is that it had no assets and ceased to do an active business in 1889. There were also notes in the name of E. W. Mosher aggregating $ 107,085.45, which it was testified were worthless, save for a collection on collateral of less than $10,000. According to the schedules in evidence these worthless notes had been taken since June 1, 1892, that is, within a period of seven months before the failure. And while the totals of these accounts, respectively, were much larger than they had been formerly, the same accounts embracing loans to a considerable amount had long been carried and were included in the published reports. There was evidence that there had been about $200,000 of worthless notes in these accounts in January, 1892. While it is not necessary for the present purpose to \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 559]\n\u00a0\n go further back, the testimony supports the finding of the trial court that the bank in fact not only had no surplus or undivided profits, but that its actual condition was one of insolvency.\n In the fourteen months before the failure the evidence shows three of the official reports made to the Comptroller of the Currency and published in the newspapers in Lincoln; those of December 2, 1891, September 30, 1892, and December 9, 1892. The total resources in these reports are stated, respectively, as $1,143,946.88, $1,033,561.11, and $1,074,867.37. Each of these reports shows the capital stock unimpaired. As of December 2, 1891, the surplus is stated to be $32,000, and the undivided profits, $23, 276.89; as of September 30, 1892, these items are $6,000 and $11,978, respectively; and as of December 9, 1892, $6,000 and $21,180.75. In January, 1892, the directors declared a dividend of 5 per cent, and in July, 1892, a further dividend of 4 per cent. There was evidence of serious discrepancies between the items in the published official reports and corresponding items as shown by the books. Without attempting to state the details disclosed by the voluminous record, it is sufficient to say that it was clearly shown by evidence substantially undisputed that these reports constituted grossly false representations of the bank's financial condition upon which the plaintiffs were invited to rely and did rely.\n There was also substantial basis for the finding that the directors assented to the making and publication of these reports; for, as we have said, whether this or that director attested a particular report is not controlling upon the question of assent. The official reports required by law are the reports of the bank, and not simply of those signing and attesting. As the reports of the bank, they are made under its authority and presumably with the assent of the board of directors. Taking the proved circumstances into consideration, and particularly in the light of the \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 560]\n\u00a0\n activity of these directors, to which we shall presently refer, it is hardly conceivable that they did not know of the last-mentioned official reports which were made on behalf of the bank and published in Lincoln. Certainly, the fact of such knowledge on the part of each of them could properly be found. There is no suggestion that they made the slightest objection to the making or publication of these reports, and the evidence was unquestionably sufficient to show their assent to this action on behalf of the bank.\n The remaining question is with respect to the evidence of the knowledge of these directors of the falsity of these official reports, or of such reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of their contents as would show that the participation in, or assent to, the violation of the statute, was 'in effect intentional.' Under date of September 8, 1891, the Comptroller of the Currency addressed a letter to President Mosher, referring to a report of an examination of the bank, and criticizing various matters. It was evidently in view of this communication that the trial court took September, 1891, as the time after which the directors had knowledge of facts showing the falsity of the reports. Without reciting the letter in full, it is sufficient to note that the Comptroller called attention to two loans (one being that of E. W. Mosher) exceeding the statutory limit; of the fact that at the time of the last report of the bank the overdrafts shown by the books largely exceeded those stated in the report; to overdue paper, with the statement that such of it as was good should be collected or made active by renewal with satisfactory security; to the excess of current expenses over undivided profits; and to the fact that the bank had a large liability on account of rediscounted paper, said to be caused by the falling off in deposits. It was suggested that some of the loans should be called in as soon as practicable, and the letter closed with the statement that, \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 561]\n\u00a0\n according to the examiner's report, the board of directors had held only two meetings during the past year, and that there was 'no record of their having examined or approved of the loans and discounts.' It was pointed out 'that the conduct of affairs of a national bank is by law devolved upon the board of directors, and that regular and frequent meetings are therefore very desirable.' The defendants insist that they were not apprised of this letter until after the failure. There was evidence tending to show that it was considered at a meeting of the board in September, 1891, but, in addition to explicit denials, there was testimony to impeach the credit of the witness so testifying. There was, however, another letter from the Comptroller of the Currency under date of February 16, 1892, which admittedly was brought to the attention of the directors. This letter, in substance, repeated several of the criticisms which had been made in the earlier letter; it referred to the desirability of collecting as soon as practicable loans that had been carried for a number of years, and to the agreement of Mosher and Outcalt to reduce their liabilities and to close 'the bulk of their outside interests,' owing to which the business of the bank had suffered; it again emphasized the duty of the directors with respect to the conduct of the bank's affairs; and it concluded with a request for a reply over the directors' 'individual signatures.' The directors, including those whose liability is now in question, accordingly signed a reply, under date of February 19, 1892, which purported to furnish explanations and promised improvement. It was stated that the bank had always had a discount committee, and that a vacancy caused by the death of a former member had been filled by the appointment of E. P. Hamer. The last-mentioned director also wrote to the Comptroller on February 23, 1892, to the effect that the manner of conducting the bank had not been satisfactory to him, and, promising better management, \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 562]\n\u00a0\n he added: 'Your letter is a move in the right direction, it indicates that we the directors should take a more positive position in the management which I for one shall do.'\n Apparently the Comptroller of the Currency was not satisfied. For it appears that he wrote another letter under date of August 31, 1892, which, having been lost, was not introduced in evidence. But the letter in reply, which the directors, including Yates, Hamer, and Thompson signed individually (under date of September 19, 1892, as stated by defendants' counsel), is in evidence and its significance cannot be overlooked. Among other things, it stated:\n'The dividend of July 1st was all right; the expenses since then have exceeded income by reason of having paid taxes & interest on certificates of deposits to an unexpected amount during July. The item of $8,000 losses referred to was an estimate of contingent losses & not any particular loss already incurred, but referred to some matters or process of liquidation, all items mentioned by you shall receive prompt attention.'\n\n There was thus sufficient evidence from these directors themselves that they were scrutinizing the affairs of the bank; that prior to the published official report of September 30, 1892, which was followed by the published official report of December 9, 1892, these directors were examining the condition of the bank, that they were considering the losses sustained, the expenses incurred, and the basis of the dividend declared in July. These were not casual statements, but deliberate assertions of activity of supervision in response to official complaint. It was plainly permissible, despite their disclaimers and denials, to attribute to these directors the knowledge which men of ordinary intelligence would readily have obtained with respect to the financial condition of the bank in the course of the supervision which they professed \n\n[240 U.S. 541, 563]\n\u00a0\n to be actively exercising. Assuming that they were ignorant of the frauds that had been committed and concealed by falsified entries, there was warrant for the conclusion that they could not have failed to acquire sufficient information to be aware that the representations in the official reports of the latter part of the year 1892 were materially false and calculated to deceive. The questions of fact, so far as they arose upon a substantial conflict in evidence, were for the trial court. Citizens Ins. Co. v. Herpolsheimer, 77 Neb. 232, 109 N. W. 160; Madison Nat. Bank v. Gross, 98 Neb. 684, 154 N. W. 207. It is not necessary for us to review the evidence in detail. It is sufficient to say that our examination of it has convinced us that the findings of the trial court, at least with respect to the last-mentioned reports, had substantial support; and, in this view, we must conclude that the reversal of the judgments, as entered in the trial court, upon the ground of the legal insufficiency of the plaintiffs' case when tested by the Federal statute, was error.\n The judgments of the Supreme Court of the State are reversed and the cases are remanded with instructions to reinstate the judgments entered in the District Court, which are affirmed. Stanley v. Schwalby, \n162 U.S. 255\n, 279-283, 40 L. ed. 960, 968-970, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 754.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 5211.

CO. v. KERSE(1916)\nNo. 129\nArgued: December 10, 1915Decided: January 10, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 576, 577]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leroy Allebach and W. N. King for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 576, 578]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George A. Berry and R. F. Downing for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action under the Federal employers' liability act to recover damages because of the death of one Barry, a brakeman in the Railway Company's yard at Charleston, West Virginia, on April 23, 1911. It was pleaded and was proved without dispute that he received injuries resulting in his death while employed in interstate commerce by the Railway Company, admittedly a common carrier. There was a verdict in favor of the administrator, and the supreme court of appeals of West Virginia refused to allow a writ of error to review the resulting judgment; hence our writ was directed to the trial court.\n The principal argument of plaintiff in error is addressed to the refusal of the court to direct a verdict in favor of defendant upon the ground that there was no proof of negligence on the part of the Railway Company, and that there was clear and undisputed proof that Barry assumed the risk of such an injury as that which resulted in his death.\n It appears that Barry was an experienced yard brakeman, and was employed in that capacity by the Railway Company in its Charleston yard. Among the industries served by the yard was that of the Kanawha Brewing \n\n[239 U.S. 576, 579]\n\u00a0\n Company, which had a private switch running through its premises and connecting with defendant's main line. Some time prior to April 23, 1911, carpenters in the employ of the Brewing Company had placed one or two pieces of timber, about 2 inches thick and 3 to 6 inches wide, in a horizontal position across the switch track, and at a height between 3 feet and 4 1\/2 feet above the top of an ordinary box car. The timber was secured by nails to two buildings on opposite sides of the track. There was a conflict of testimony as to the length of time that the timber had been in position prior to the accident, witnesses fixing it at periods varying from two or three days to a month. It was necessary for members of defendant's yard crew to pass in and out of the switch and under the obstruction frequently. The timber was in plain view, but because of a sharp curve in the switch track could be seen by those upon the top of a car for only a short distance when approaching it. On the 23d of April a switching crew, of which Barry was that day a member, went upon the switch to haul out upon the main line a car destined for interstate commerce. The engine, in charge of one Leonard, was backed in upon the switch, and Barry coupled up the car, which was an ordinary box car, and then climbed to the top of it. Leonard started to pull out of the switch, and as the train proceeded Barry, who was standing near the rear end of the car, and not looking forward, but sidewise (presumably watching Wintz, the conductor, who was standing upon the ground, in charge of the train), came in contact with the timber and was thrown to the ground, sustaining a facture of the skull, from which he soon died.\n The action of the Railway Company, through its employees, in conducting its switching operations upon a switch obstructed, as this one was, in such manner as to endanger the lives of brakemen upon its cars, speaks so clearly of negligence that no time need be spent upon it. \n\n[239 U.S. 576, 580]\n\u00a0\n The evidence that the timber had been in the position described for a considerable period of time was presumptive evidence of notice to the company; besides which, the switch engineer and conductor both testified to actual knowledge on their part, prior to the time of the accident to Barry. Under the employers' liability act (35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149,  1, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657) the action lies for 'injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier.'\n Upon the question of assumption of risk, the case for the Railway Company was stronger. One Forbes, a fellow brakeman, testified that Barry had worked on the same crew with witness during all the time he was employed by the company, this being 'something like a month;' that the obstruction across the Brewing Company's track had been there 'pretty near the whole time Mr. Barry was working for the company,-must have been there something like a month;' that 'I told Mr. Barry to be careful and watch this piece of timber, myself, and I and Mr. Barry had passed under it ourselves, and we had to get down this way (witness stoops quite low) to get under the piece of timber on the box car, and I told him several times about watching;' and that he and Barry probably went in on the switch together two or three times a day, and he had often seen Barry go under the obstruction. And Wintz, the conductor, testified that Barry commenced work for the company 'about the first of the month, and worked up until the 23d;' also that 'I notified him about the overhead pieces, to be careful and watch out for them.' This testimony, as seen in print, certainly seems convincing, although Wintz, upon cross-examination, could not say but that he had told Mr. Kerse, the administrator, that he and Barry had 'never had any conversation at all about this overhead obstruction.'\n But there was substantial contradiction of the testimony \n\n[239 U.S. 576, 581]\n\u00a0\n of these witnesses. Leonard, the engineer of the yard locomotive, called as a witness for plaintiff, testified distinctly that the day on which Barry met his death was the first that the witness had seen him; that he did not know whether Barry was employed by the Railway Company or not. And one Greter, called by defendant, testified that it was to him Barry had applied for employment as yard brakeman, and he identified the written application signed by Barry; he also testified that Barry entered the service of the company 'about three or four days' after the application was approved. The application itself was introduced in evidence by defendant; it is dated March 31, 1911, and is indorsed 'Approved, A. N. Lyon, Supt., 4\/14\/1911.' The latter date, coupled with Greter's testimony, would seem to fix April 17th or 18th (five or six days before the accident) as the earliest date on which Barry was employed by the Railway Company. And this is so inconsistent with a material part of the testimony of Forbes and Wintz that the jury may reasonably have concluded that their testimony should be rejected in toto,-falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus,- and that in truth, as indicated by the testimony of Leonard, Barry had never worked upon the Brewing Company's switch previous to the time of the disaster. The burden of proof of the assumption of risk was upon defendant, and unless the evidence tending to show it was clear and from unimpeached witnesses, and free from contradiction, the trial court could not be charged with error in refusing to take the question from the jury.\n Only one matter remains to be mentioned. The court refused to instruct the jury, as requested by defendant, 'that if they find from the evidence that Thomas P. Barry knew of the presence of the piece of timber over the track of the Kanawha Brewing Company, and knew that it would not clear a man standing on the top of a tox car, and with such knowledge continued in the service of \n\n[239 U.S. 576, 582]\n\u00a0\n the Kanawha & Michigan Railway Company, where his duties required him to pass under said piece of timber, then said Thomas P. Barry must be held to have assumed the risk of being injured by being struck by said piece of timber and there can be no recovery by the plaintiff herein.'\n Since knowledge of a fixed obstruction over the track in such a position as not to clear a man standing upon the top of a box car would seem necessarily to import to an experienced brakeman that there was a risk of injury to him in that situation, and since there was no evidence of objection by Barry or promise of reparation by his employer to rebut the presumption that the risk was assumed, the refusal of this request appears plainly erroneous. But this does not result in a reversal of the judgment under review, because by specific findings of fact the jury negatived the hypothesis upon which alone the instruction was based. In response to particular interrogatories submitted by the court, they found that Barry did not know that the piece of timber was stretched over the track, and (of course) did not know that the timber was so low that it would not clear him standing upon the top of the box car.\n A judgment is not to be reversed for an error by which the plaintiff in error cannot have been prejudiced. And the refusal of an instruction as to the legal result that would follow only upon the hypothesis that the deceased knew of the presence of the timber, and knew it would not clear a man standing upon the top of a box car, became legally insignificant when the jury had in its findings distinctly negatived the facts that made up the hypothesis. Thus the progress of the trial rendered the error wholly immaterial to the merits. Greenleaf v. Birth, 5 Pet. 132, 135, 8 L. ed. 72, 73; Fidelity & D. Co. v. Courtney, \n186 \nU.S. 342, 351\n, 46 S.

NEW JERSEY(1916)\nNo. 51\nArgued: October 31, 1916Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 160, 161]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Griggs and Charles Thaddeus Terry for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 160, 164]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Herbert Boggs and John W. Wescott, Attorney General of New Jersey, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Brandeis delivered the opinion of the court:\n The New Jersey Automobile Law of 1908 (P. L. 1908, p. 613) provides in substance that no person, whether a resident or nonresident of the state, shall drive an automobile upon a public highway unless he shall have been licensed so to do and the automobile shall have been registered under the statute; and also that a nonresident owner shall appoint the secretary of state his attorney upon whom process may be served 'in any action or legal proceeding caused by the operation of his registered motor vehicle within this state against such owner.' The statute fixes the driver's license fee for cars of less than thirty horse power at $2, and more than thirty horse power at $4. It fixes the registration fee at $3 for cars of not more than ten horse power; $5 for those from eleven to twenty-nine horse power; and $10 for those of thirty or greater horse power. Both license fees and registration fees, whensoever issued, expire at the close of the calendar year. The moneys received from license and registration fees in excess of the amount required for the maintenance of the motor vehicle department are to be applied to the maintenance of the improved highways. Penalties are prescribed for using the public highways \n\n[242 U.S. 160, 165]\n\u00a0\n without complying with the requirements of the act. The material portions of the statute are copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Kane, a resident of New York, was arrested while driving his automobile on the public highways of New Jersey, \n\n[242 U.S. 160, 166]\n\u00a0\n and tried in the recorder's court. The following facts were stipulated: Kane had been duly licensed as a driver under the laws of both New York and New Jersey. He had registered his car in New York, but not in New Jersey. He had not filed with the secretary of state of New Jersey the prescribed instrument appointing that official his attorney upon whom process might be served. When arrested he was on his way from New York to Pennsylvania. The aggregate receipts from license and registration fees for the year exceeded the amount required to defray the expenses of the motor vehicle department, so that a large sum became available for maintenance of the improved roads of the state. Kane contended that the statute was invalid as to him, a nonresident, because it violated the Constitution and laws of the United States regulating interstate commerce, and also because it violated \n\n[242 U.S. 160, 167]\n\u00a0\n the 14th Amendment. These contentions were overruled, and he was fined $5. The conviction was duly reviewed both in the supreme court and by the court of errors and appeals. The contentions were repeated in both of those courts; and both courts affirmed the conviction. Kane v. State, 81 N. J. L. 594, L.R.A. 1917B, 553, 80 Atl. 453, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 237. The case was brought here by writ of error.\n The power of a state to regulate the use of motor vehicles on its highways has been recently considered by this court and broadly sustained. It extends to nonresidents as well as to residents. It includes the right to exact reasonable compensation for special facilities afforded as well as reasonable provisions to insure safety. And it is properly exercised in imposing a license fee graduated according to the horse power of the engine. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 U.S. 610\n, 59 L. ed. 385, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 140. Several reasons are urged why that case should not be deemed controlling:\n\n 1. \nThe Maryland law did not require the nonresident to appoint an agent within the state upon whom process may be served. But it was recognized in discussing it, that 'the movement of motor vehicles over the highways is attended by constant and serious dangers to the public.' (p. 622.) We know that ability to enforce criminal and civil penalties for transgression is an aid to securing observance of laws. And in view of the speed of the automobile and the habits of men, we cannot say that the legislature of New Jersey was unreasonable in believing that ability to establish, by legal proceedings within the state, any financial liability of nonresident owners, was essential to public safety. There is nothing to show that the requirement is unduly burdensome in practice. It is not a discrimination against nonresidents, denying them equal protection of the law. On the contrary, it puts nonresident owners upon an equality with resident owners.\n\n 2. \nThe Maryland law contained a reciprocal provision by which nonresidents whose cars are duly registered in \n\n[242 U.S. 160, 168]\n\u00a0\n their home state are given, for a limited period, free use of the highways in return for similar privileges granted to residents of Maryland. Such a provision promotes the convenience of owners and prevents the relative hardship of having to pay the full registration fee for a brief use of the highways. It has become common in state legislation; and New Jersey has embodied it in her law since the trial of this case in the lower court. But it is not an essential of valid regulation. Absence of it does not involve discrimination against nonresidents; for any resident similarly situated would be subjected to the same imposition. A resident desiring to use the highways only a single day would also have to pay the full annual fee. The amount of the fee is not so large as to be unreasonable; and it is clearly within the discretion of the state to determine whether the compensation for the use of its highways by automobiles shall be determined by way of a fee, payable annually or semiannually, or by a toll based on mileage or otherwise. Our decision sustaining the Maryland law was not dependent upon the existence of the reciprocal provision. Indeed, the plaintiff in error there was not in a position to avail himself of the reciprocal clause; and it was referred to only because of the contention that the law discriminated between nonresidents; that is, that Maryland extended to residents of other states privileges it denied to residents of the District.\n\n 3. \nIn Hendrick v. Maryland, it appeared only that the nonresident drove his automobile into the state. In this case it is admitted that he was driving through the state. The distinction is of no significance. As we there said (622): 'In the absence of national legislation covering the subject, a state may rightfully prescribe uniform regulations necessary for public safety and order in respect to the operation upon its highways of all motor vehicles-those moving in interstate commerce as well as others.'\n\n 4. \nIn the Hendrick Case it did not appear, as here, that \n\n[242 U.S. 160, 169]\n\u00a0\n the fees collected under the Motor Vehicle Law exceeded the amount required to defray the expense of maintaining the regulation and inspection department. But the Maryland statute, like that of New Jersey, contemplated that there would be such excess, and provided that it should be applied to the maintenance of improved roads. And it was expressly recognized that the purpose of the Maryland law 'was to secure some compensation for the use of facilities provided at great cost from the class for whose needs they are essential and whose operations over them are peculiarly injurious.'\n The judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Pitney took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Part IV.-The Operation of Motor Vehicles.\n ...\n'16.

C. A. 121, 201 Fed. 811, 127 C. C. A. 184, 210 Fed. 696. See Northern P. R. Co. v. Boyd, \n228 U.S. 482\n, 57 L. ed. 931, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 554.\n The facts are less complicated than the proceedings that \n\n[240 U.S. 166, 173]\n\u00a0\n have grown out of them. The Kansas City, Pittsburg, & Gulf Railroad extended From Kansas City to Port Arthur on the Gulf of Mexico. It used terminals at Kansas City belonging to the Belt company above mentioned, and companies in its control, and at Port Arthur belonging to a Dock Company. All three were mortgaged, and after a default on the bonds of the Gulf Company in 1899, a plan was made to bring the road and terminals into one hand. The Gulf Company's mortgage was to be foreclosed and a new company formed, which was to exchange its own securities for the stock and bonds of the Gulf, Dock, and Belt Companies, making a new mortgage to raise the necessary funds. The Gulf Company's mortgage was foreclosed, the appellant company was formed, issued its new securities, and in March and April, 1900, became the owner of the Gulf road and of most of the stocks and bonds of the old companies, including the Belt Company. In September, 1900, a suit was begun to foreclose the Belt mortgage, and on December 31, 1901, it was sold for the amount of its mortgage to the appellant. The court of appeals thought it plain that the foreclosure was part of the original plan; and as it also thought that the mortgaged property was worth enough above the mortgage to pay the unsecured creditors, it held that the stockholders, when receiving pay for their stock, were receiving it in substance as the proceeds of a transaction that removed all property of the Belt Company from its unsecured creditors' reach. The appellant was the principal holder of the Belt Company stock, as well as the purchaser of its property with notice of the outstanding debts, and therefore was decreed to pay the Trust Company's claim.\n The proceedings began with a creditors' bill by the Cambria Steel Company against the Belt Company and the Guardian Trust Company to prevent the latter from selling securities held by it for an alleged debt of the Belt Company, the bill denying the debt. The court of \n\n[240 U.S. 166, 174]\n\u00a0\n appeals thought that this suit was really a suit of the appellant. The Cambria Steel Company has disappeared and the proceedings have been carried on by the Belt Company, the instrument of the appellant, and later by the appellant, intervening in the suit, and all charging that the Trust Company was indebted to the Belt. The Trust Company, on the other hand, asserted its rights and prayed judgment for its debt in its answer to the Belt, although it failed to insert a similar prayer in its answer to appellant. The ground of the appellant's intervention was that the Belt mortgage covered after-acquired property, so that it was entitled to the securities in the Trust Company's hands unless the Trust Company could make good its claim. On the other hand, the decree foreclosing the Belt mortgage expressly left open the right of the Trust Company to contend that the appellant was bound to pay the Belt Company's unsecured debts.\n The appellant attacks the conclusion of the circuit court of appeals upon several grounds. In the first place it contends that the Trust Company is bound by the plan because it was a party to it, exchanged its own Belt Company stock in pursuance of it, was a depositary under it, and used all its influence to induce other stockholders and bondholders to come in. It asserts that the plans contained an express covenant not to hold the new company liable for the debts of the old one. It also asserts that the property was not worth more than the mortgage. We will consider these and some subordinate matters in turn.\n The plan presented elaborate estimates of the funds required. One item was: 'For present stock [of the Kansas City Suburban Belt Railroad Company] one quarter of a share of new preferred stock and three quarters of a share of new common stock of the company as reorganized for each share of the present stock of those who may deposit thereunder.' The Trust Company exchanged its stock and it is said that by its retention of this benefit \n\n[240 U.S. 166, 175]\n\u00a0\n it has precluded itself from claiming its debt. But the plan also stated at the outset as one of the results to be attained, 'The payment of the floating debt and the existing Car Trust obligations,' and at a later point it allowed for payment of floating debts, $475,000, to come from proceeds of the sale of first mortgage bonds and preferred stock and payment of $10 per share by participating stockholders. It is true that the estimate turned out to be much too small, but the plan did not on its face give notice of an intent to prefer the Belt stockholders to its creditors, and therefore the Trust Company, by assenting to it and exchanging stock under it, lost no rights. What has happened is that, owing perhaps to unexpected difficulties, the plan has not been carried out. The appellant has no ground for complaining that the Trust Company has not tendered back its stock, which it took before the foreclosure of the Belt Road was begun.\n But it is said that the Trust Company covenanted not to assert its claim because the agreement provided that 'no right is conferred, nor any trust, liability, or obligation (except . . .) is created by this agreement or the plan, or is assumed hereunder, or by or for any new company in favor of any bondholder or any other creditor or any holder of any claims whatsoever against the said companies, . . . with respect to any property acquired by purchase at any foreclosure sale.' It appears to us that argument cannot make plainer the meaning of these words. They exclude an obligation arising from the instrument, but neither purport to nor could exclude rights of creditors founded on the facts to which we have referred. Those rights were untouched, and none the less that this particular creditor became a party to the agreement because of its other interests that were concerned. We may remark in this connection that we are equally unable to find in the plan a contract in favor of the Trust Company as an unsecured creditor. The plan sets out a \n\n[240 U.S. 166, 176]\n\u00a0\n general scheme that it was hoped would be worked out, but its nature, the words quoted, and the authority given to the committee for carrying out the plan to modify it and to use their discretion,-all are inconsistent with the notion of a promise that all unsecured debts should be paid.\n As the claim of the Trust Company was put by the court of appeals upon the equitable right of creditors to be preferred to stockholders against the property of a debtor corporation, it is essential to inquire whether the appellant received any such property,-that is, whether it got by the foreclosure more than enough to satisfy the mortgage, which was a paramount lien. The master found, as he expressed it, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the amount for which the property was sold, $1, 000,000, the amount of the mortgage, was its fair market value. Although the evidence was not reported, the circuit court of appeals was of opinion that it sufficiently appeared that there was a valuable equity. The argument for the appellant assumes that the different conclusion was reached while leaving the master's finding to stand. But the decision rather lays that finding on one side upon considerations that may be summed up in a few words. The allowance made for the Belt Company's bonds shows that they were regarded as well secured. The stockholders of the Gulf Company in their exchange paid $10 a share for stock of the appellant received by them. Therefore it must be assumed that the stock of the appellant was worth at least that amount. Therefore the $4,750,000 of that stock given for the Belt Company's stock was worth at least $475,000, and probably more. But the value of this stock depended on the value of the Belt Company's property above the mortgage. It appears to us that while perhaps not justifying definite figures, the reasoning warrants the belief that there was an equity for which the appellant must account.\n The appellant urges that the foreclosure sale is to be \n\n[240 U.S. 166, 177]\n\u00a0\n treated as a distinct transaction,-that after it had become the owner of the greater part of the bonds and stock of the Belt Company it was free to do as it pleased. If it had simply kept the stock it would have incurred no liability to creditors of the Belt Company, and an independent foreclosure would put it in no worse place. But the ownership of the Belt Road by the new company was contemplated from the first, and although no fraud on creditors was suggested or intended in the plan, still the court of appeals was justified in regarding the whole proceeding as one from the start to the close, and in throwing on the appellant the responsibility of so carrying it out as to avoid inequitable results.\n It is said that the Trust Company is barred by laches: that the appellant took possession on January 1, 1902, and that the Trust Company did not assert its claim until 1905 in this cause; that it knew and was intimately connected with every step of the reorganization, and was silent at a time when its conduct would influence others, as the successful assertion of its claim would have depressed the market value of the appellant's stock and bonds. But the Trust Company set up its claim in this suit in answer to the Cambria bill on November 5, 1900. The very ground of the bill was to prevent the Trust Company from selling securities to satisfy the claim as it had given notice that it intended to. The company tried to become a party to the Belt foreclosure and did succeed in saving its rights from prejudice. When later the Belt Company and the appellants came into this suit, it set up its claim again. Without going into further detail we are of opinion that the Trust Company is not barred.\n Some technical objections may be left pretty much upon the decision below. 127 C. C. A. 184, 210 Fed. 699. It is objected that the liability of the appellant is not open because the exception to the master's conclusion against it was put upon other grounds than the merits, but we \n\n[240 U.S. 166, 178]\n\u00a0\n see no reason to doubt that the court of appeals was right in thinking that justice would be done by adopting the course that it did. So it is said that the appellant was induced by the form of the exceptions to forego reopening the master's finding that the Belt Company was indebted to the Trust Company. But it is not to be believed that the appellant has given up anything that it thought worth insisting upon. 127 C. C. A. 184, 210 Fed. 700. So as to the absence of a specific prayer for relief in the Trust Company's answer to the appellant's intervention in its own name. In short, while it is true that reorganization plans often would fail if the old stockholders could not be induced to come in and to contribute some fresh money, and that the necessity of such arrangements should lead courts to avoid artificial scruples, still we are not prepared to say that the court of appeals was wrong in finding that there had been a transgression of the well-settled rule of equity in this case, or that it went further than to see that substantial justice should be done.\n There is a motion to dismiss upon which, in view of our decision, the defendant in error would not desire to insist, and on the other side a petition for certiorari in case its appeal should be dismissed. In the circumstances the distinctions become of little importance. But the Cambria bill asserted a lien under the judgment of a Federal court, and the petition of the appellant asserted title under a decree of a Federal court, so that the decree may be affirmed upon the appeal.

Upon rehearing the supreme court held evidence of contributory negligence, though not pleaded, and inadmissible to defeat a recovery, should have been received in mitigation of damages if offered for that specific purpose. But it said the evidence in question was properly excluded because tendered without restriction.\n We have been cited to no authority showing a settled local rule requiring counsel, without inquiry by the court, to announce in advance the purpose for which evidence is tendered. Earlier cases in Louisiana lend support to the contrary and commonly approved practice. Thompson v. Chauveau, 6 Mart. N. S. 458, 461; Hitchcock v. North, 5 Rob. (La.) 328, 329, 39 Am.

That in all actions hereafter brought against any such common carrier by railroad under or by virtue of any of the provisions of this act to recover damages for personal injuries to an employee, or where such injuries have resulted in his death, the fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee. . . .'\n\n Manifestly, under this provision, a defendant carrier has the Federal right to a fair opportunity to show in diminution of damages any negligence attributable to the employee.\n The state supreme court upheld the railway company's claim of right to show contributory negligence under its general denial; but the trial court emphatically denied this and positively excluded all evidence to that end. As, under the Federal statute, contributory negligence is no bar to recovery, the plain purpose in offering the excluded evidence was to mitigate damages. In such circumstances it was unnecessary to go through the idle form of articulating the obvious. If timely objection upon the ground ultimately suggested by the supreme court had been sustained, it could have been easily obviated; but counsel had no reason to anticipate such a ruling, and certainly, we think, were not required to do so at their peril.\n Plaintiff in error has been improperly deprived of a Federal right. The judgment below is accordingly reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKANSAS CITY WESTERN R. CO. v. MCADOW(1916)\nNo. 127\nArgued: Decided: January 31, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 51, 52]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles F. Hutchings and McCabe Moore for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John H. Atwood and Oscar S. Hill for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action for personal injuries, brought by the defendant in error against the plaintiff in error, in whose employ he was. The original petition alleged that the defendant operated a line of electric railway extending from Leavenworth, Kansas, through Wolcott and Kansas City, in the same state, into Kansas City, Missouri; that the plaintiff was a motorman upon a car on the line and was injured in Kansas by a collision due to the defendant's negligence. An amendment was allowed alleging that the \n\n[240 U.S. 51, 53]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff was injured on a trip from Kansas City, Missouri, to Leavenworth, with further details, and that the defendant's negligent acts were in violation of the act of Congress controlling such matters when the parties were engaged in commerce among the states. The defendant was a Kansas corporation having an electric railway from Leavenworth into Kansas City, Kansas. It had a traffic agreement with the Metropolitan Street Railway Company operating street railways in Kansas City, Missouri, by which the latter was to receive the cars of the former, carrying passengers and freight, and move them through designated streets in Missouri and back to Kansas; each party to be liable for damage due to its negligence during this part of the transit, and the fares and freight money to be divided in certain proportions. By a later agreement the route was modified and it was provided that the defendant should pay the trainmen's wages during the movement in Missouri, but that they should be under the exclusive control of the Metropolitan Company, and, as between said companies, should in all respects be regarded for the time being as its employees. There was evidence that in fact, at the time of the accident, the only control exercised by the Missouri Company was to put a conductor upon the car to receive the fares; that while in Missouri it received its orders from the Kansas side; and that the company was in the hands of receivers, who seem not to have recognized the contract. The plaintiff got a verdict, which was sustained. The errors assigned are, in substance, that the amendment expressly bringing the case under the act of Congress ought not to have been allowed; that the act does not apply to electric roads, and that, if it does, the defendant was not engaged in commerce among the states, or at least was not if the contract between the companies governed the movement of the car.\n As to the first, it would be enough to say that if the \n\n[240 U.S. 51, 54]\n\u00a0\n declaration on which the case was tried brought it under the act, the fact that it appeared as an amendment to one that alleged the same facts with the exception of the plaintiff's coming from beyond the state raises no question under the laws of the United States. Central Vermont R. Co. v. White, \n238 \nU.S. 507, 513\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1433, 1437, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 865, 9 N. C. C. A. 265; Brinkmeier v. Missouri P. R. Co. \n224 \nU.S. 268, 270\n, 56 S. L. ed. 758, 760, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 412. The state court sustained the amendment on the ground of waiver, but if it had held it allowable as a matter of course, no Federal right would have been infringed. Wabash R. Co. v. Hayes, \n234 \nU.S. 86, 90\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1226, 1230, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 729, 6 N. C. C. A. 224. It is said that by the amendment it gave a jurisdiction to the Missouri court that otherwise it would not have had under the act of April 5, 1910, chap. 143, 36 Stat. at L. 291, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1010. But actions of tort are transitory, and the argument based on the act of 1910 would have no application unless the defendant was engaged in business governed by that act. The argument would be that if so engaged, then, under the statute, the interstate road could not be sued in a state court unless it was doing business in that state. We express no assent to it, but if sound it would afford no ground for objecting to the amendment; and no question of jurisdiction was raised. The amendment introduced no fact inconsistent with those first alleged, and it was unnecessary when the facts were stated to invoke the act of Congress in terms. The law governing the situation is equally the law of the state, whether derived from Congress or the state legislature, and must be noticed by the courts. Grand Trunk Western R. Co. v.

So, again, many cases have intimated that the technical considerations by which the defendant seeks to establish that it was not engaged in commerce among the states are not final. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Clark Bros. Coal Min. Co. \n238 \nU.S. 456, 467\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1406, 1411, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896; Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 520\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1182, 1189, 32 Sup. Ct.

But these questions really are immaterial here since the Kansas statute is so similar to that of the united States that the liability of the defendant does not appear to be affected by the question which of them governed the case. In such circumstances it is unnecessary to decide which law applied. Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. Gray, \n237 U.S. 399\n, 59 L. ed. 1018, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 620, 9 N. C. C.

When this capital stock does not exceed $10,000, the fee is $10; when it exceeds $10,000, but is not over $25,000, the fee is $25; and there are further increases, graduated as stated, until the maximum fee of $2,500 is reached, that sum \n\n[240 U.S. 227, 231]\n\u00a0\n being payable in all cases where the paid-up capital stock exceeds $5,000, 000. The plaintiff in error is a railroad corporation organized under the laws of Kansas, and its road extends into several states. It has a paid-up capital stock of $31,660,000. On March 31, 1914, it paid to the secretary of state, under protest, the required fee of $2,500, and brought this action to recover the amount, insisting that the tax is a direct burden upon interstate commerce and is laid upon property outside the state, and hence is invalid under the Federal Constitution. The supreme court of Kansas sustained the tax, thus defining its nature: 'The fee collected is a tax upon the right of corporate existence-the franchise granted by the state to be a corporation-to do business with the advantages associated with that form of organization.' 95 Kan. 261, 147 Pac. 791.\n It must be assumed, in accordance with repeated decisions, that the state cannot lay a tax on interstate commerce 'in any form,' by imposing it either upon the business which constitutes such commerce or the privilege of engaging in it, or upon the receipts as such derived from it.

And, further, in determining whether a tax has such a direct relation to interstate commerce as to be an exercise of power prohibited by the commerce clause, our decision must regard the substance of the exaction,-its operation and effect as enforced,-and cannot depend upon the manner in which the taxing scheme has been characterized. Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. \n\n[240 U.S. 227, 232]\n\u00a0\n v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 228\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1031, 1038, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638; United States Exp. Co. v.

Rep. 99.\n Examining the statute in the present case, we see no reason to doubt the accuracy of the description of the tax by the state court. We take it to be simply a tax on the privilege of being a corporation,-on the primary corporate franchise granted by the state. The authority of the state to tax this privilege, or franchise, has always been recognized, and it is well settled that a tax of this sort is not necessarily rendered invalid because it is measured by capital stock which in part may represent property not subject to the state's taxing power. Thus, in Society for Savings v. Coite, 6 Wall. 594, 606, 607, 18 L. ed. 897, 902, 903, the power to levy the franchise tax was deemed to be 'wholly unaffected' by the fact that the corporation had invested in Federal securities; and in Home Ins. Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594, 599\n, 600 S., 33 L. ed. 1025, 1029, 1030, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 593, it was held that a tax upon the privilege of being a corporation was not rendered invalid because a portion of its capital (the tax being measured by dividends) was represented by United States bonds. These cases were cited with distinct approval, and the rule they applied in distinguishing between the subject and the measure of the tax was recognized as an established one, in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. \n220 \nU.S. 107, 165\n, 55 S. L. ed. 389, 419, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312. It is also manifest that the state is not debarred from imposing a tax upon the granted privilege of being a corporation, because the corporation is engaged in interstate as well as intrastate commerce. Delaware R. Tax, 18 Wall. 206, 231, 232, 21 L. ed. 888, 896; State R. Tax Cases, \n92 \nU.S. 575, 603\n, 23 S. L. ed. 663, 669; Philadelphia & S. Mail S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326, 336\n, 344 S., 30 L. ed. 1200, 1201, 1204, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 308, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1118; Ashley v. Ryan, \n153 U.S. 436\n, 38 L. ed. 773, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 664, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 865; New York ex rel. Cornell S. B. Co. v. Sohmer, \n235 \nU.S. 549, 559\n, 560 S., 59 L. ed. 355, 359, 360, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 162. And, agreeably to the principle above mentioned, it has never been, and cannot be, maintained that an annual tax upon this privilege is in itself, and in all cases, repugnant \n\n[240 U.S. 227, 233]\n\u00a0\n to the Federal power merely because it is measured by authorized or paid- up capital stock. The selected measure may appear to be simply a matter of convenience in computation, and may furnish no basis whatever for the conclusion that the effort is made to reach subjects withdrawn from the taxing authority. We have recently had occasion (Baltic Min. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 \nU.S. 68, 83\n, 58 S. L. ed. 127, 133, L.R.A. --, --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 15) to emphasize the necessary caution that 'every case involving the validity of a tax must be decided upon its own facts;' and if the tax purports to be laid upon a subject within the taxing power of the state, it is not to be condemned by the application of any artificial rule, but only where the conclusion is required that its necessary operation and effect is to make it a prohibited exaction.\n In Philadelphia & S. Mail S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326, 336\n, 344 S., 30 L. ed. 1200, 1201, 1204, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 368, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1118, the state had laid 'a tax of 8\/10 of 1 per centum upon the gross receipts of said company for tolls and transportation.' As the court said: 'The tax was levied directly upon the receipts derived by the company from its fares and freights for the transportation of persons and goods between different states, and between the states and foreign countries, and from the charter of its vessels which was for the same purpose.' It was necessarily concluded that the tax was imposed upon interstate commerce. In Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 228\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1031, 1038, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638, the tax upon the railroad company was 'equal to 1 per centum of its gross receipts.' The court held that this was 'merely an effort to reach the gross receipts, not even disguised by the name of an occupation tax, and in no way helped by the words 'equal to.\" By the statute which was under review in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1, 36\n, 37 S., 54 L. ed. 355, 369, 370, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190,-as was said in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. supra, summarizing that case,-the state 'undertook to levy a graded charter fee upon the entire capital stock of one hundred millions of dollars on the Western Union Telegraph Company, a foreign corporation, and engaged in \n\n[240 U.S. 227, 234]\n\u00a0\n commerce among the states, as a condition of doing local business within the state of Kansas. This court held, looking through forms and reaching the substance of the thing, that the tax thus imposed was in reality a tax upon the right to do interstate business within the state, and an undertaking to tax property beyond the limits of the state; that whatever the declared purpose, when reasonably interpreted, the necessary operation and effect of the act in question was to burden interstate commerce and to tax property beyond the jurisdiction of the state, and it was therefore invalid.' To the same effect were Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 56, 65\n, 54 S. L. ed. 378, 385, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 232, and Ludwig v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n216 U.S. 146\n, 54 L. ed. 423, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 280. The act before the court in Meyer v. Wells F. & Co. \n223 U.S. 298\n, 56 L. ed. 445, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218, which provided for what was called a 'gross revenue tax,' was deemed to be 'so similar to the Texas statute held bad' in the case of Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Taxas, as to deserve a similar condemnation. On the other hand, in United States Exp. Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335, 346\n, 56 S. L. ed. 459, 465, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 211, it appeared that the reference to gross receipts was only intended fairly to measure a tax upon a subject within the taxing power of the state, and the tax was sustained. And, in the case of Baltic Min. Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, where a tax on foreign corporations was measured by the authorized capital stock and was limited to $2,000, the court also reached the conclusion 'that the authorized capital is only used as the measure of a tax, in itself lawful, without the necessary effect of burdening interstate commerce,' and that hence the legislation was within the authority of the state. It is true that in that case it was pointed out that the taxing act did not apply to corporations engaged in railroad, telegraph, etc., business, or to those corporations whose business is interstate commerce; but it was also distinctly stated that the products of the corporations before the court were 'sold and shipped in interstate commerce,' and that to that extent they were 'engaged \n\n[240 U.S. 227, 235]\n\u00a0\n in the business of carrying on interstate commerce,' and were 'entitled to the protection of the Federal Constitution against laws burdening commerce of that character.' It was because the tax, although measured by authorized capital stock, could not, in view of its limitations, be regarded as imposing a disrect burden upon interstate commerce, that the tax was upheld. 231 U. S. pp. 86, 87.\n In the present case, the tax is not laid upon transactions in interstate commerce, or upon receipts from interstate commerce, either separately or intermingled with other receipts. It does not fluctuate with the volume of interstate business. It is not a tax imposed for the privilege of doing an interstate business. It is a franchise tax,-on the privilege granted by the state of being a corporation,-and while it is graduated according to the amount of paid-up capital stock, the maximum charge is $2,500 in the case of all corporations having a paid-up capital of $5,000,000 or more. This is the amount imposed in the present case, where the corporation has a capital of $31,660,000. We find no ground for saying that a tax of this character, thus limited, is in any sense a tax imposed upon interstate commerce.\n For similar reasons, the contention cannot be sustained that the tax was one on property beyond the jurisdiction of the state. Undoubtedly, a tax may be in form a privilege tax and yet, in substance, may be a tax on property. But the present tax cannot be regarded as a property tax at all.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKANSAS CITY, M. & B. R. CO. v.

By this act it is provided that corporations organized under \n\n[242 U.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n the laws of Alabama shall pay an annual franchise tax as follows: where the paid-up capital stock does not exceed $50,000, $1 per thousand of such paid-up capital stock; where paid-up capital stock is more than $50,000, and up to $1,000,000, $1 per thousand on the first $50,000, and 50 cents for each thousand of the remainder; where paid-up capital stock is more than $1,000,000, and up to $5,000,000, $1 dollar per thousand on the first $ 50,000, and 50 cents per thousand for the next $950,000, and 25 cents per thousand for the remainder; where he paid-up capital stock exceeds $5,000, 000, $1 per thousand on the first $50,000, 50 cents per thousand on the next $950,000, 25 cents per thousand on the next $4,000,000, and 10 cents per thousand on the remainder; and that corporations organized under the laws of any other state, and doing business within the state of Alabama, shall pay annually franchise tax as above, based, however, on the actual amount of capital employed in the state of Alabama. The act also contains provisions not relevant to this action and not necessary to be set forth here.\n The railroad company is a consolidated corporation, existing by virtue of the consolidation, under concurrent acts of the states of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama, of three independent and distinct railroad corporations created by and formerly operating solely within the respective states named. As regards this consolidation, plaintiff avers--\n'that it is a consolidated corporation, made up and consisting of the consolidation of three distinct and separate corporations, under the following circumstances: A railroad corporation organized and existing solely under the laws of the state of Tennessee acquired, constructed, owned, and operated all of that part of plaintiff's line and railway situated within the state of Tennessee; a separate and distinct railroad corporation, organized and existing \n\n[242 U.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n solely under the laws of the state of Mississippi, acquired, constructed, owned, and operated all that part of plaintiff's line and railway situated within the state of Mississippi; and a separate and distinct railroad corporation, organized and existing solely under the laws of the state of Alabama, acquired, constructed, owned, and operated all that part of plaintiff's line and railway situated within the state of Alabama. Plaintiff avers that said separate railroad corporations, being desirous of operating said distinct and separately owned properties as a single system, for the conduct of the business of a common carrier in interstate commerce, as well as the continuation of intrastate commerce within said several states, before the period mentioned or involved herein, and by virtue of concurrent or contemporaneous laws or special acts of said several states, including the states of Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as the state of Alabama, consolidated themselves into a corporation known as Kansas City, Memphis, & Birmingham Railroad Company, the plaintiff herein, and, in pursuance of the laws of each of said states, duly filed therein agreements and instruments consolidating said companies, and complying with the laws of each of said states authorizing the same. And plaintiff avers that by said consolidation the shares of stock of said several companies were surrendered by the holders thereof, and in lieu thereof there were issued the shares of stock of said consolidated company, the plaintiff herein, being the capital stock of plaintiff issued and outstanding as aforesaid. Plaintiff further avers that the capital stock on which said franchise tax was estimated and exacted as aforesaid was and is the capital stock issued and outstanding under the circumstances aforesaid, although less than one half thereof was issued in lieu of the stock of or represents the property or assets or business of the Alabama corporation which became a constituent of the plaintiff by consolidation as aforesaid.' \n\n[242 U.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n The entire capital stock of the consolidated railroad company amounted to $5,976,000, and it was upon this entire amount that the company was assessed. By this action the railroad company seeks to recover the full amount of the franchise tax exacted upon that basis, and contends that in any event it should have been assessed only upon that part of the capital employed by it in the state of Alabama.\n\n The railroad company averred, if it was required to pay the franchise tax in question upon its entire capital, that it would be paying another and different rate of taxation, or another and different amount of franchise tax, from that which is required of like corporations doing business in Alabama, contrary to the provision of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws; that the enforcement of the act by subjecting to its operation the railroad company's property in other states constituted a taking of its property without due process of law; and that said act imposed a direct burden upon interstate commerce in requiring it to pay, in addition to all other fees and taxes provided by law, a tax upon its capital stock for the right and privilege of transacting and carrying on its interstate business as a common carrier, in violation of clause 3 of  8, article I. of the Federal Constitution.\n A demurrer was filed to this complaint, which demurrer was sustained. Upon appeal to the supreme court of Alabama, this judgment was affirmed ( 192 Ala. 687, 68 So. 1018), and a writ of error brings the action to this court.\n The consolidated company was formed, so far as the state of Alabama is concerned, under  1583 of the Alabama Code of 1886, which provides in substance, as follows: That whenever the lines of any two or more railroads chartered under the laws of that or any other state, which, when completed, may admit the passage of burden or \n\n[242 U.S. 111, 116]\n\u00a0\n passenger cars over any two or more of such roads continuously without break or interruption, such companies are authorized before or after completion to consolidate themselves into a single corporation, in the manner following: The directors of such corporations may enter into an agreement, prescribing the terms and conditions thereof, mode of carrying into effect, name, number of directors, etc., and such new corporation shall possess all the powers, rights, and franchises conferred upon the two or more corporations, and shall be subject to all the restrictions, and perform all the duties, imposed by such statute. Provision is also made for ratification of such consolidation by the stockholders, after which ratification the agreement is deemed completed, as to each corporation. It is also provided that 'every such new corporation so formed shall keep an office in the state of Alabama, and be in all respects subject to the laws of the state of Alabama as a domestic corporation.' The corporation is to be deemed consolidated when a copy of the agreement is filed with the secretary of state, and after the election of the first board of directors the property and franchises of each corporation shall be vested in the new corporation, and it shall be subject to the liabilities of its integral parts, as if such debts had been incurred by it.\n It will be noted that this statute, which is a grant of corporate rights from the state of Alabama to the consolidated company, contains the express provision that such company shall in all respects be subject to the laws of the state of Alabama as a domestic corporation. Applying  12 of the statute, the Alabama supreme court has held that the railroad company is a corporation organized under the laws of that state, and, as such, subject to the franchise tax imposed by that section of the statute.\n The Federal questions (which are alone within the jurisdiction of this court) are to be determined upon this construction of the state statute by its highest court. \n\n[242 U.S. 111, 117]\n\u00a0\n When the companies comprised in this consolidation sought to avail themselves of the laws of Alabama, they were asking a privilege and right which, subject to the limitations of the Federal Constitution, was within the authority of the state. This principle was succinctly stated in Ashley v. Ryan, \n153 \nU.S. 436, 442\n, 38 S. L. ed. 773, 777, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 664, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 865:\n'Nor is the question at issue affected by the fact that some of the constituent elements which entered into the consolidated company were corporations owning and operating property in another state. The power of corporations of other states to become corporations, or to constitute themselves a consolidated corporation under the Ohio statutes, and thus avail of the rights given thereby, is as completely dependent on the will of that state as is the power of its individual citizens to become a corporate body, or the power of corporations of its own creation to consolidate under its laws. Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 10 L. ed. 274; Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, 15 L. ed. 451; Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 181, 19 L. ed. 357, 360.'\n\n This doctrine has been affirmed since. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Kentucky, \n161 \nU.S. 677, 703\n, 40 S. L. ed. 849, 860, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 714, and previous cases in this court therein cited; Interstate Consol. Street R. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n207 \nU.S. 79, 84\n, 52 S. L. ed. 111, 114, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 26, 12 Ann. Cas. 555.\n The railroads comprising this consolidation entered upon it with the Alabama statute before them and under its conditions, and, subject to constitutional objections as to its enforcement, they cannot be heard to complain of the terms under which they voluntarily invoked and received the grant of corporate existence from the state of Alabama.\n The specific objections based upon the Federal Constitution remain to be noticed. It is said that the company is deprived of the equal protection of the laws, this contention being based upon the fact that domestic corporations, operating only within the state, are required to pay the tax upon property within the state, and foreign cor- \n\n[242 U.S. 111, 118]\n\u00a0\n porations are taxed only upon the basis of property within the state. To support this contention as to denial of equal protection of the laws, the company relies principally upon the decision of this court in Southern R. Co. v. Greene, \n216 U.S. 400\n, 54 L. ed. 536, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247. In that case, a foreign corporation, complying with the laws of Alabama, entered upon business within the state, paid both license and property taxes imposed by the laws of the state, and when it was attempted to impose upon it another tax for the privilege of doing business in the state, a business in all respects like that done by domestic corporations of a similar character who were not subjected to the additional tax complained of, it contended that it was denied equal protection of the law, and this court so held.\n That case is readily distinguishable from the one now under consideration. Here the state imposes the franchise tax equally upon all of its corporations, consolidated and otherwise. The fact that a wholly intrastate corporation may own no property outside of the state, while the consolidated company does, presents no case of arbitrary classification. In both cases, the franchise tax is based upon a percentage of the capital stock. There is no denial of equal protection of the laws because a state may impose a different rate of taxation upon a foreign corporation for the privilege of doing business within the state than it applies to its own corporations upon the franchise which the state grants in creating them.\n It is urged that this tax is void because it undertakes to tax property beyond the jurisdiction of the state, and imposes a direct burden upon interstate commerce. Objections of this character were so recently discussed, and the previous cases in this court considered, in Kansas City, Ft. S. & M. R. Co. v. Botkin, \n240 U.S. 227\n, 60 L. ed. 617, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261, that it would be superfluous to undertake extended discussion of the subject now. In that case, after a full review of the previous decisions in this court, it was held that each case \n\n[242 U.S. 111, 119]\n\u00a0\n must depend upon its own circumstances, and that while the state could not tax property beyond its borders, it might measure a tax within its authority by capital stock which in part represented property without the taxing power of the state. As to the objection based upon the due process clause of the Constitution, we think that principle controlling here. There is no attempt in this case to levy a property tax; a franchise tax within the authority of the state is in part measured by the capital stock representing property owned in other states.\n The tax is not of the character condemned in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 54 L. ed. 355, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190, and kindred cases. In the latter case, a tax of large amount was imposed upon a foreign corporation engaged in interstate commerce, for the privilege of doing local business within the state. Under the circumstances therein disclosed and the character of the business involved, this court held that the statute was in substance an attempt to tax the right to do interstate business, and to tax property beyond the confines of the state, and was therefore void. Here, a franchise tax is levied upon a corporation consolidated under the laws of the state by its own acceptance of that law in incorporating under it.\n So of the objection that the tax imposes a burden upon interstate commerce, the test of validity recognized in previous cases and repeated in Kansas City, Ft. S. & M. R. Co. v. Botkin, supra, is the nature and character of the tax imposed. The state may not regulate interstate commerce or impose burdens upon it; but it is authorized to levy a tax within its authority, measured by capital in part used in the conduct of such commerce, where the circumstances are such as to indicate no purpose or necessary effect in the tax imposed to burden commerce of that character. In the present case, the franchise tax is imposed upon the capital stock of a corporation consoli- \n\n[242 U.S. 111, 120]\n\u00a0\n dated under the state law, and engaged in both interstate and intrastate commerce.\n We find nothing in the amount or character of the tax which makes it a burden upon interstate commerce, and so beyond the authority of the state to impose. It results that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKELLY v. GRIFFIN(1916)\nNo. 777\nArgued: Decided: April 17, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. John S. Miller, Edward Osgood Brown, and Pierce Butler for appellant.\n\n\n[241 U.S. 6, 9]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Almon W. Bulkley, Henry B. F. Macfarland, and Clair E. More for appellees.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 6, 11]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellant was held for extradition to Canada, and petitioned for and obtained a writ of habeas corpus. After a hearing upon the returns to the writ and to a writ of certiorari issued to the commissioner by whose warrant the \n\n[241 U.S. 6, 12]\n\u00a0\n petitioner was detained, the district judge discharged the writ. An appeal was allowed and several objections have been pressed to the proceeding, which we will take up in turn. The matter arises out of frauds in the construction of the new Parliament buildings at Winnipeg, in which Kelly, the contractor, and a number of public men, are alleged to have been involved.\n First it is said that jurisdiction of the appellant's person has not been obtained legally. On October 1, 1915, he was arrested without a warrant, on a telegram from Winnipeg. The next day a complaint was made before the commissioner by the British Vice Consul General in Chicago upon ifformation Consul General in Chicago upon information the petitioner was turned over to the United States marshal by the Chicago police. On October 15 a new complaint was filed by the British Consul General, a new warrant was placed in the hands of the marshal, and the former complaint was dismissed. Wright v. Henkel, \n190 \nU.S. 40, 42\n, 44 S., 63, 47 L. ed. 948, 949, 956, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 781, 12 Am. Crim. Rep. 386. The contention is that the original arrest was illegal, and that the appellant was entitled to be set at liberty before the warrant of October 2 or that of October 15 could be executed with effect.\n But however illegal the arrest by the Chicago police, it does not follow that the taking of the appellant's body by the marshal under the warrant of October 2 was void. The action of the officers of the state or city did not affect the jurisdiction of the commissioner of the United States. Furthermore, the order dismissing the complaint of October 2 was that the appellant be discharged forthwith from custody; so that, on the face of the record, it would seem that before being held under the present warrant the appellant had the moment of freedom which he contends was his right. It is urged that the Canadian authorities are trying to take advantage of their own wrong. But the appellant came within reach of the commissioner's warrant by his own choice, and the most that can be said \n\n[241 U.S. 6, 13]\n\u00a0\n is that the effective exercise of authority was made easier by what had been done. It was not even argued that the appellant was entitled to a chance to escape before either of the warrants could be executed. This proceeding is not a fox hunt. But merely to be declared free in a room with the marshal standing at the door having another warrant in his hand would be an empty form. We are of opinion that, in the circumstances of this case as we have stated them, the omission of a formal act of release and a subsequent arrest, if they were omitted, furnishes no ground for discharging the appellant upon habeas corpus. All the intimations and decisions of this court indicate that the detention of the appelant cannot be declared void. Pettibone v. Nichols, \n203 U.S. 192\n, 51 L. ed. 148, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111, 7 Ann. Cas. 1047; Iasigi v. Van de Carr, \n166 \nU.S. 391, 393\n, 394 S., 41 L. ed. 1045, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595; Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, \n142 \nU.S. 651, 662\n, 35 S. L. ed. 1146, 1150, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 336. If we were satisfied that a different rule would be applied by the final authority in Great Britain, other questions would arise. Charlton v. Kelly, \n229 U.S. 447\n, 57 L. ed. 1274, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 397, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 945. But we are not convinced by anything that we read in Hooper v. Lane, 6 H. L. Cas. 443, 27 L. J. Q. B. N. S. 75, 3 Jur. N. S. 1026, 6 Week. Rep. 146, that a different rule would be applied, and we think it unnecessary to discuss the differences in detail.\n The complaint of October 15 charges perjury, obtaining money by false pretenses, and, conjointly, stealing or embezzling and unlawfully receiving money and other property of the King which had been embezzled, stolen, or fraudulently obtained by means of a conspiracy as set forth. The perjury alleged is swearing falsely to the proportion of cement sand and broken stone put into the caissons of the new Parliament buildings at Winnipeg, in a judicial proceeding before the public accounts committee of the legislative assembly of the province of Manitoba, the appellant knowing his statements to be false. It is objected that although perjury is mentioned as a ground for extradition in the treaty, the appellant should not be surrendered because the Canadian Criminal Code,  170, \n\n[241 U.S. 6, 14]\n\u00a0\n defines perjury as covering false evidence in a judicial proceeding, 'whether such evidence is material or not.' As to this it is enough to say that the assertions charged here were material in a high degree, and that the treaty is not to be made a dead letter because some possible false statements might fall within the Canadian law that perhaps would not be perjury by the law of Illinois. 'It is enough if the particular variety was criminal in both jurisdictions.' Wright v. Henkel, \n190 \nU.S. 40, 60\n, 61 S., 47 L. ed. 948, 955, 956, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 781, 12 Am. Crim. Rep. 386. There is no attempt to go beyond the principle common to both places in the present case. It is objected further that although the above committee was authorized to examine witnesses upon oath, it was only in 'such matters and things as may be referred to them by the House.' But even if there were not some evidence and a finding (Ornelas v. Ruiz, \n161 \nU.S. 502, 509\n, 40 S. L. ed. 787, 789, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 689), the nature of the investigation, the purposes for which the committee was appointed, and the fact that the appellant appeared before it without objection, would warrant a presumption of regularity in a summary proceeding like this.\n The plan for the foundations of the buildings was changed from piling called for by the written contract to caissons filled with concrete, and the false representations alleged concerning the amount of concrete, lumber, iron rings, and bolts used in the extra work. They consisted in bills or 'progress estimates' addressed to the provincial government for 'labor and material supplied,' setting forth the amount of each item thus stated to have been supplied. It is objected that the amounts demanded by the bills were paid not upon the bills, but upon vouchers coming from the department of public works, and that the provincial architect who certified the bills was not deceived. The person who made out the certificates relied upon the bills in good faith, and it appears that without the bills the payments would not have been made. The fact that there were other steps necessary in addition \n\n[241 U.S. 6, 15]\n\u00a0\n to sending in a false account, or that other conspirators co-operated in the fraud, does not affect the result that, on the evidence, Kelly obtained the money from the provincial government by fraudulent representations to which he was a party, and that his false statement was the foundation upon which the government was deceived.\n The last charge, stealing or embezzling and receiving money fraudulently obtained, needs a word of explanation. It may be assumed that there is no evidence of larceny or embezzlement as (commonly) defined, but the receiving of property known to have been fraudulently obtained is a crime by the laws of both Canada and Illinois. There may be a doubt whether the appellant, if a party to the fraud, received the money of the government directly from it, or through a third hand, so as to be guilty under this count of the complaint. We are not prepared to pronounce his detention upon the count unjustifiable, in view of the finding. We assume, of course, that the government in Canada will respect the convention between the United States and Great Britain, and will not try the appellant upon other charges than those upon which the extradition is allowed. Therefore we do not think it necessary to require a modification of the complaint before the order discharging the writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.\n Final order affirmed. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKRYGER v. WILSON(1916)\nNo. 99\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 171, 172]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. O. E. Holman and William W. Fry for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 171, 173]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George S. Grimes and Jesse Van Valkenburg for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Brandeis delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes here on writ of error to the supreme court of North Dakota to review a decree quieting title in the defendant in error-the plaintiff below-to land situated in that state. The plaintiff in error, a resident of Minnesota, claimed under an executory contract for \n\n[242 U.S. 171, 174]\n\u00a0\n the purchase of the land in controversy, and the rights of the parties turned upon whether this contract was outstanding or had been duly canceled. Both Minnesota, where the contract was made and to be performed, and North Dakota, had statutes providing that a vendor in a contract for the sale of land may not cancel and terminate the same upon default, except after written notice to the vendee, giving him at least thirty days within which to make good his nonperformance. Minn. Rev. Stat. 1905,  4442; N. D. Rev. Codes 1905, chap. 30, art. 3, N. D. Comp. Laws 1913, chap. 30, art. 4. The material provisions of the latter statute are copied in the margin. \n1\n The vendor in this case (grantor of defendant \n\n[242 U.S. 171, 175]\n\u00a0\n in error) had given to the sheriff of the county where the land lay a written notice of cancellation to be served upon the plaintiff in error if found within the said county, and upon return of not found, caused the same to be published in a county newspaper, and later filed for record affidavits of publication and of nonredemption,-all in conformity with the North Dakota statute, if it applied.\n When the present action was brought to quiet title, plaintiff in error defended, and asked for counter relief, contending that his contract was still valid and subsisting, as the action prescribed by the Minnesota statute to entitle a vendor to cancel had not been taken. The trial court held that the North Dakota law governed; that under it the contract had been 'duly and legally canceled;' that the plaintiff in error having shown no right in the land, title should be forever quieted in the defendant in error. This decree was affirmed by the supreme court on appeal. Wilson v. Kryger, 29 N. D. 28, 149 N. W. 721. We are asked to review the case on the ground that the state court deprived the plaintiff in error of property without \n\n[242 U.S. 171, 176]\n\u00a0\n due process of law and impaired the obligation of his contract, in holding that the cancelation proceeding, of which the plaintiff in error had no actual notice, effectively terminated his rights under the contract.\n It is apparent from the above statement that there has been no lack of due process. The court below, having jurisdiction of the suit to quiet title, was called upon to determine the conflicting claims to the land. The plaintiff in error voluntarily appeared, and he availed himself of the opportunity to urge his claims to equitable ownership under the contract of sale. The court decided against him, holding the contract no longer outstanding. The most that the plaintiff in error can say is that the state court made a mistaken application of doctrines of the conflict of laws in deciding that the cancellation of a land contract is governed by the law of the situs instead of the place of making and performance. But that, being purely a question of local common law, is a matter with which this court is not concerned. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 48 L. ed. 268, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132; Finney v. Guy, \n189 \nU.S. 335, 346\n, 47 S. L. ed. 839, 845, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 558; Allen v. Alleghany Co. \n196 U.S. 458\n, 49 L. ed. 551, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 311; Marrow v. Brinkley, \n129 U.S. 178\n, 32 L. ed. 654, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 267.\n The argument of the plaintiff in error is seemingly based upon the erroneous theory that his rights were foreclosed by the cancellation proceeding, which, lacking the requisite notice, deprived him of property without due process. But the action under the cancellation statute was in no sense a judicial proceeding. It was simply a statutory condition with which vendors were required to comply before they could take advantage of a default by the vendee. If the contract, properly interpreted, or the law, properly applied, required that this condition be performed in Minnesota, steps taken by him under the North Dakota statute would be ineffective. Whether or not proper proceedings had been taken to secure cancelation could be determined only by a court having \n\n[242 U.S. 171, 177]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction; and the North Dakota court had jurisdiction not only over the land, but, through the voluntary appearance of plaintiff in error, also over him. His rights have been foreclosed, not by the cancellation proceeding under the statute, but by a due and regular judicial decree which was based upon the finding that a default had occurred, of which the vendor was entitled to take advantage, having complied with the proper law. If the plaintiff in error had not submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court, the decree could have determined only the title to the land, and would have left him free to assert any personal rights he may have had under the contract. But, having come into court and specifically asked in his cross bill that he be declared entitled to the 'possession and control of the real estate described in the complaint herein under a contract of sale,' he cannot now complain if he has been concluded altogether in the premises. The plaintiff in error relies upon Selover, B. & Co. v. Walsh, \n226 U.S. 112\n, 57 L. ed. 146, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 69. That was a personal action for breach of contract, and not, like the present case, an action merely to determine the title to land; and, as the court found on the facts there involved, that the proper law as to cancellation had been applied, the case cannot be construed as holding that an erroneous application thereof would raise a question of due process.\n The contention based on the contract clause is equally devoid of merit, for there has been no subsequent legislation impairing the obligation of the contract. Impairment by judicial decision does not raise a Federal question. Cross Lake Shooting & Fishing Club v. Louisiana, \n224 U.S. 632\n, 56 L. ed. 924, 32 Sup. Ct.

U S(1916)\nNo. 895\nArgued: April 4, 1916Decided: May 1, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. Leo Everett, Francis L. Kohlman, and H. B. Walmsley for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Divis and Robert Szold for respondent. \n\n[241 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Charged in the trial court (southern district of New York) by an indictment containing two counts, with violating  32 of the Penal Code [ 35 Stat. at L. 1095, chap. 321, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,196], the petitioner was convicted and on December 3d, 1914, sentenced to two years' imprisonment in the penitentiary. The trial was presided over by the district judge of the western district of Michigan, assigned to duty in the district conformable to the provisions of  18 of the Judicial Code [ 36 Stat. at L. 1089, chap. 231], as amended by the act of Congress of October 3, 1913 (chap. 18, 38 Stat. at L. 203, Comp. Stat. 1913,  985). To the conviction and sentence in January following error was directly prosecuted from this court, the assignments of error assuming that there was involved not only a question of the jurisdiction of the court as a Federal court, but also constitutional questions. For the purpose of the writ one of the district judges of the southern district of New York gave a certificate as to the existence and character of the question of jurisdiction, evidently with the intention of conforming to  238 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1215].\n After the record on this writ had been filed in this court, a writ of error to the conviction was prosecuted in May, 1915, from the court below. In September following that court, acting on a motion to dismiss such writ of error on \n\n[241 U.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n the ground that its prosecution was inconsistent with the writ sued out from this court, entered an order providing for dismissal unless the plaintiff in error within ten days elected which of the two writs of error he would rely upon, and subsequently, before the expiration of the time stated, the court declined to comply with the request of the plaintiff in error that the questions at issue be certified to this court. On October 29, 1915, the election required of the plaintiff in error not having been made, the writ of error was dismissed.\n On January 31st, 1916, the writ of error prosecuted from this court came under consideration as the result of a motion to dismiss, and finding that there was no question concerning the jurisdiction of the trial court within the intendment of the statute and no constitutional question, the writ was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n240 U.S. 60\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255. Thereupon the plaintiff in error in the court below asked that the cause be reinstated and heard, and, upon the refusal of the request, an application was made to this court for leave to file a petition for mandamus to compel such action, and, if not, for the allowance of a certiorari, and although the former application was denied, the case is here because of the allowance of the latter remedy.\n Primarily the question is, was it the duty of the court below to exercise jurisdiction? As under the statute it is indisputable that there was jurisdiction and the duty to exert it unless the conditions existed which authorized a direct writ of error from this court, it follows that the dismissal by this court of the direct writ for want of jurisdiction affirmatively determined that there was jurisdiction in the court below, and error was committed in not exerting it unless by some neglect to avail of proper procedure, or because of some line of inconsistent conduct, the right to invoke the jurisdiction of the court below was lost. As we have seen, the assumed existence of the latter cause was the basis of the refusal to exercise jurisdiction; that is, \n\n[241 U.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n the inconsistency which it was assumed resulted from prosecuting the direct writ of error from this court and subsequently suing out the writ of error from the court below, from which it was deduced that there was a duty to elect between the two as a prerequisite to the right to ask at the hands of the court below the exertion of the jurisdictional authority cast upon it by law. But if the exercise of the assumed duty of election which was imposed had resulted in the abandonment of the writ from the court below, there would have been nothing left upon which the jurisdiction of that court could have been exerted, and it is hence apparent that in substance the order was but a direction that the plaintiff in error abandon the direct writ prosecuted from this court as a prerequisite to his right to invoke the action of the court upon the writ pending before it. But, aside from the demonstration of error which arises from the mere statement of this inevitable result of the order made by the court below, it is equally clear that such order rested upon a misconception arising from treating as one, things which are distinct; that is, the existence of authority to compel the abandonment of one of two valid and available remedies because of their inconsistency, leaving therefore the one not abandoned in force, and the want of power to compel an election of one of two remedies where the exertion of judicial power alone could determine which of the two was available, and where therefore the exercise of the election ordered in the nature of things involved the power to destroy all relief, and thus frustrate the right of review conferred by the statute by one or the other of the remedies. As, in view of this distinction, it clearly results that the determination of the plaintiff in error to abandon, under the order of the court, one or the other of the two writs of error, could not have validated the writ not abandoned if it was not authorized by law, it must follow that the election to which the order of the court submitted the plaintiff in error was \n\n[241 U.S. 103, 110]\n\u00a0\n not real, and therefore afforded no basis for the refusal of the court to determine the validity of the writ of error pending before it and to decide the case if it deemed it had jurisdiction. Indeed, if it be conceded that the situation arising from the pendency of the two writs created doubt, that concession would not change the result, since we are of opinion that the power to have certified to this court the jurisdictional or other questions as to which the doubt existed was the remedy created by the statute to meet such a situation, and to obviate the possibility of denying to the plaintiff in error the right to a review which again it must be borne in mind the statute gave under one or the other of the two writs.\n Correcting the error committed by the court below by its order of dismissal, the case on its merits is within our competency to decide as the result of the operation of the certiorari. As, however, it is clear that the questions on the merits, as demonstrated by the previous judgment of dismissal of the direct writ of error, are of a character which, under the statute, if they had been disposed of by the court below in the discharge of its duty, would have been finally determined, and as it is equally apparent that none of the questions except the one of jurisdiction, that is, the duty of the court below to have decided the cause, are within the exceptional considerations by which certiorari is allowed, it follows that, in order to give effect to the statute, our duty would be, as a general rule, having corrected the error resulting from the dismissal, and having afforded a remedy for the failure of the court below to exercise jurisdiction, to go no farther and remand the case so that the questions at issue might be finally disposed of. Lutcher & M. Lumber Co. v. Knight, \n217 U.S. 257\n, 54 L. ed. 757, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 505. But while not in any degree departing from the general rule, we think it is inapplicable here because of the serious doubt which may have been engendered by the certificate as to the jurisdictional question given by the district judge, \n\n[241 U.S. 103, 111]\n\u00a0\n although it is now established that there was no foundation whatever for allowing it, and because of the resulting complexity of the question as to whether the jurisdiction of this court had not attached to the subject- matter and excluded the advisability if not the power on the part of the court below to certify to this court the question of which writ of error was paramount, when of necessity a certificate involving the solution of that question had already been made by the district judge. We therefore dispose of the merits, restating the case so far as may be essential.\n The section of the Penal Code charged to have been violated punishes anyone who, 'with intent to defraud either the United States or any person, shall falsely assume or pretend to be an officer or employee acting under the authority of the United States, or any Department, or any officer of the government thereof, and shall take upon himself to act as such, or shall in such pretended character demand or obtain from any person or from the United States, or any Deparment, or any officer of the government thereof any money, paper, document, or other valuable thing,' etc. The indictment charged that at a stated time the petitioner 'unlawfully, knowingly and feloniously did falsely assume and pretend to be an officer of the Government of the United States, to wit, a member of the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America, that is to say, A. Mitchell Palmer, a member of Congress representing the twenty- sixth district of the state of Pennsylvania, with the intent, then and there, to defraud Lewis Cass Ledyard,' and other persons who were named and others to the grand jury unknown, 'and the said defendant, then and there, with the intent and purpose aforesaid, did take upon himself to act as such member of Congress; against the peace,' etc., etc.\n We consider the contentions relied upon for reversal separately. \n\n[241 U.S. 103, 112]\n\u00a0\n 1. It is insisted that no offense under the statute was stated in the indictment because a member of the House of Representatives of the United States is not an officer acting under the authority of the United States within the meaning of the provision of the Penal Code upon which the indictment was based. This contention is supported by reference to what is assumed to be the significance in one or more provisions of the Constitution of the words 'civil officers,' and reliance is specially placed upon the ruling made at an early day in the Blount Case, Whart. St. Tr. p. 200, that a Senator of the United States was not a civil officer subject to impeachment within the meaning of  4 of article 2 of the Constitution. But, as previously held in sustaining the motion to dismiss the direct writ of error, the issue here is not a constitutional one, but who is an officer acting under the authority of the United States within the provisions of the section of the Penal Code under consideration? And that question must be solved by the text of the provision, not shutting out as an instrument of interpretation proper light which may be afforded by the Constitution, and not forgetting that a penal statute is not to be enlarged by interpretation, but also not unmindful of the fact that a statute, because it is penal, is not to be narrowed by construction so as to fail to give full effect to its plain terms as made manifest by its text and its context. United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385, 395, 18 L. ed. 830, 832; United States v. Corbett, \n215 \nU.S. 233, 242\n, 243 S., 54 L. ed. 173, 175, 176, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 81.\n Guided by these rules, when the relations of members of the House of Representatives to the government of the United States are borne in mind, and the nature and character of their duties and responsibilities are considered, we are clearly of the opinion that such members are embraced by the comprehensive terms of the statute. If, however, considered from the face of the statute alone, the question was susceptible of obscurity or doubt,-which \n\n[241 U.S. 103, 113]\n\u00a0\n we think is not the case,-all ground for doubt would be removed by the following considerations: (a) Because prior to and at the time of the original enactment in question the common understanding that a member of the House of Representatives was a legislative officer of the United States was clearly expressed in the ordinary, as well as legal, dictionaries. See Webster, verbo 'office;' Century Dict. verbo 'officer;' 2 Bouvier's Law Dict. 1897 ed. 540, verbo 'legislative officers;' Black's Law Dict. 2d ed. p. 710, verbo 'legislative officer.' (b) Because at or before the same period in the Senate of the United States, after considering the ruling in the Blount Case, it was concluded that a member of Congress was a civil officer of the United States within the purview of the law requiring the taking of an oath of office. (Cong. Globe, 38th Congress, 1st session, pt. 1, pp. 320-331.) (c) Because also in various general statutes of the United States at the time of the enactment in question a member of Congress was assumed to be a civil officer of the United States. Revised Statutes,  1786, 2010, and subdivision 14 of  563. (d) Because that conclusion is the necessary result of prior decisions of this court, and harmonizes with the settled conception of the position of members of state legislative bodies as expressed in many state decisions. The Floyd Acceptances (Pierce v. United States) 7 Wall. 666, 676, 19 L. ed. 169, 173; Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 58, 64\n, 45 S. L. ed. 84, 88, 274, 275, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 152; Wiley v. Sinkler, \n179 \nU.S. 58, 64\n, 45 S. L. ed. 84, 88, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 17; Swafford v. Templeton, \n185 \nU.S. 487, 492\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1005, 1007, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 783; People ex rel. Kelly v. Brooklyn, 77 N. Y. 503, 507, 508, 33 Am. Rep. 659; Morrill v. Haines, 2 N. H. 246; Shelby v. Alcorn, 36 Miss. 273, 291, 72 Am. Dec. 169; Parks v. Soldiers' & S. Home, 22 Colo. 86, 96, 43 Pac. 542.\n\n 2. \nBut it is urged, granting that a member of Congress is embraced by the word 'officer,' yet no offense was stated, since it was not charged that, in pretending to be an officer, the accused did an act which he would have been authorized to do under the authority of the United States had he \n\n[241 U.S. 103, 114]\n\u00a0\n possessed the official capacity which he assumed to have. In other words, the proposition is that the first clause of the section prohibits the falsely assuming or pretending to be an officer with intent to defraud, and, as such officer, taking upon himself to act under the authority of the United States,-that is, to do an authorized act. The contention which the proposition covers was insisted upon not only in the demurrer which was overruled, but by requests to charge and exceptions to the charge given. While it is undoubtedly true that the construction asserted finds some apparent support in one or more decided cases in district courts of the United States (United States v. Taylor, 108 Fed. 621; United States v. Ballard, 118 Fed. 757; United States v. Farnham, 127 Fed. 478), we are of opinion that it misconceives the statute and fails to give it proper effect because, when rightly construed, the operation of the clause is to prohibit and punish the falsely assuming or pretending, with intent to defraud the United States or any person, to be an officer or employee of the United States as defined in the clause, and the doing in the falsely assumed character any overt act, whether it would have been legally authorized had the assumed capacity existed or not, to carry out the fraudulent intent. Briefly stated, we conclude this to be the meaning of the clause for the following reasons: (b) Because the words 'acting under the authority of the United States' are words designating the character of the officer or employee whose personation the clause prohibits, since, if the words are thus applied, the clause becomes coherent and free from difficulty, while if, on the other hand, they are applied only as limiting and defining the character of the overt act from which criminality is to arise, confusion and uncertainty as to the officer or employee whose fraudulent simulation is prohibited necessarily results. (b) Because the consequence of a contrary construction would be obviously \n\n[241 U.S. 103, 115]\n\u00a0\n to limit the application of the clause as shown by its general language and as manifested by the remedial purpose which led to its enactment. ( Cong. Rec. vol. 14, pt. 4, p. 3263, 47th Cong. 2d Sess.) (c) Because to adopt a contrary view would be absolutely inharmonious with the context, since it would bring into play a conflict impossible of reconciliation. To make this clear it is to be observed that the last clause of the section makes criminal the demanding or obtaining in the assumed capacity which the first clause prohibits, 'from any person or from the United States , . . . any money, paper, document, or other valuable thing, . . .' We say which the first clause prohibits because there is no re-expression of the prohibition against assuming or pretending contained in the first clause except as that prohibition is carried over and made applicable to the second by the words 'or shall in such pretended character demand,' etc. As it is obvious that the acts made absolutely criminal by the second clause are acts which may or may not have been accomplished as the result of exerting in the pretended capacity an authority which there would have been a lawful right to exert if the character had been real, and not assumed, it results not only that the conflict which we have indicated would arise from adopting the construction claimed, but the error of such contention as applied to the first clause is conclusively demonstrated.\n Indeed, the consideration thus given the contention in question was unnecessary because its error is persuasively if not conclusively established by the ruling in United States v. Barnow, \n239 U.S. 74\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 19. In that case the accused was charged under both clauses of the section with having on the one hand falsely assumed to be an employee of the United States, acting under the authority of the United States, 'to wit, an agent employed by the government to sell a certain set of books entitled, 'Messages and Papers of Presidents,\" and with having taken \n\n[241 U.S. 103, 116]\n\u00a0\n upon himself to act as such by visiting a named person for the purpose of carrying out the intended fraud, and, on the other hand, under the second clause of the section with having, by means of the same false personation, obtained a sum of money. The case came here to review the action of the court below in sustaining a demurrer to the indictment as stating no offense because there was no authorized employee of the character which had been falsely assumed, and no legal authority therefore to have done the overt acts with which either count was concerned. The judgment was reversed under the express ruling that the existence of the office or the authority was not essential, as the assuming or pretending to be and act as an officer or employee of the United States was within the purview of the statute, and necessarily embraced within its prohibitions.\n\n 3. \nIt is urged that the indictment is defective because of its failure to describe the circumstances of the offense. It suffices to say that, after considering them, we think that the many authorities cited to support the contention are wholly inapplicable to the conditions disclosed by the record, and we are further of opinion that those conditions make it clear that the contention is devoid of merit. We say this because it will be observed from the text of the indictment which we have previously reproduced that it clearly charges the illegal acts complained of and the requisite fraudulent intent, states the date and place of the commission of the acts charged, and gives the name and official character of the officer whom the accused was charged with having falsely personated. It is, moreover, to be observed that there is not the slightest suggestion that there was a want of knowledge of the crime which was charged or of any surprise concerning the same, nor is there any intimation that any request was made for a bill of particulars concerning the details of the offense charged. Under this situation we think that \n\n[241 U.S. 103, 117]\n\u00a0\n the case is clearly covered by  1025, Revised Statutes, Comp. Stat. 1913 ,  1691. Connors v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 408, 411\n, 39 S. L. ed. 1033, 1034, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 951; Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56, 84\n, 52 S. L. ed. 681, 695, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 428; New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 481, 497\n, 53 S. L. ed. 613, 623, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 304; Holmgren v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 509, 523\n, 54 S. L. ed. 861, 867, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 588, 19 Ann. Cas. 778.\n\n 4. \nIt is insisted that there was no proof whatever tending to show an intent to defraud or to establish criminality under the section relied upon, and therefore there should have been an instruction to acquit. In so far as the proposition concerns the absence of proof of the doing of an overt act which was authorized by law, and therefore relates to the wrongful construction of the statute which we have previously pointed out, it is disposed of by what was said on that subject. As to the want of any evidence justifying the submission of the case to the jury on the question of the criminal intent relied upon or of the acts charged, we content ourselves with the statement that, after a close scrutiny of the record, we are of the opinion that the contention is wholly without merit and that the case was clearly one where the proof was of such a character as to justify its being submitted to the jury for its consideration.\n\n 5. \nFinally we come to consider a contention not raised in the trial court, not suggested in the court below while the case was there pending and before the order of dismissal which we have reviewed was entered, and not even indirectly referred to in this court when the case was pending on the direct writ of error, which writ was, as we have seen, dismissed because it presented for consideration no question of jurisdiction and none arising under the Constitution. Indeed, the contention now relied on was for the first time urged in a supplemental brief filed on the present hearing. The proposition is that the trial court had no jurisdiction; in fact, that no such court existed, because the trial was presided over by the district judge of the western district of Michigan, assigned to the \n\n[241 U.S. 103, 118]\n\u00a0\n southern district of New York conformably to the statute (chap. 18, 38 Stat. at L. 203, Comp. Stat. 1913,  985), and that the effect of such assignment under the statute was virtually to destroy the southern district of New York by creating a new district whose boundaries were undefined, thus violating the rights secured to the accused by the 6th Amendment, since he was subjected to trial in a district not established when the offense with which he was charged was committed. In fact, the further contention is made that to assign a judge of one district and one circuit to perform duty in another district of another circuit was in substance to usurp the power of appointment and confirmation vested by the Constitution in the President and Senate. As to the first of these contentions, we think it suffices to say that it rests upon a construction of the words of the statute authorizing the assignment of a judge of one district and circuit to duty in another district and circuit which is wholly unfounded, and which rests upon a premise conflicting with the practice of the government under the Constitution substantially from the beginning. As to the second contention, we think merely to state it suffices to demonstrate its absolute unsoundness.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAMAR v. U S(1916)\nNo. 434\nArgued: Decided: January 31, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 60, 61]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Davis for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 60, 62]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Carl E. Whitney and A. Leo Everett for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 60, 64]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error was tried and convicted upon an indictment charging him with having falsely pretended to be an officer of the government of the United States, to wit, a member of the House of Representatives, that is to say, A. Mitchell Palmer, a member of Congress, with intent to defraud J. P. Morgan & Company and the United States Steel Corporation. The case is brought here directly on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction because the indictment does not charge a crime against the United States, and that the interpretation of the Constitution was involved in the decision that a Congressman is an officer of the United States. There are subsidiary objections stated as constitutional that the indictment is insufficient, and that it does not appear in what district the crime was committed.\n On the matter of jurisdiction it is said that when the controversy concerns a subject limited by Federal law, such as bankruptcy (Frederic L. Grant Shoe Co. v. W. M. Laird Co. \n212 U.S. 445\n, 53 L. ed. 591, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 332), copyright (Globe Newspaper Co. v. Walker, \n210 U.S. 356\n, 52 L. ed. 1096, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 726), patents (Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Co. \n237 U.S. 479\n, 59 L. ed. 1056, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 658), or admiralty (The Jefferson, \n215 U.S. 130\n, 54 L. ed. 125, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 54, 17 Ann. Cas. 907), the jurisdiction so far coalesces with the merits that a case not within the law is not within the jurisdiction of the court (The Ira M. Hedges [Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. Cornell S. B. Co.] \n218 \nU.S. 264, 270\n, 54 S. L. ed. 1039, 1040, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 17, 20 Ann. Cas. 1235; Haddock v. Haddock, \n201 U.S. 562\n, 50 L. ed. 867, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 525, 5 Ann. Cas. 1 ). Jurisdiction is a matter of power, and covers wrong as well as right decisions. Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 234\n, 235 S., 52 L. ed. 1039, 1041, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 641; Burnet v. Desmornes y Alvarez, \n226 \nU.S. 145, 147\n, 57 S. L. ed. 159, 160, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 63. There may be instances in which it is \n\n[240 U.S. 60, 65]\n\u00a0\n hard to say whether a law goes to the power or only to the duty of the court; but the argument is pressed too far. A decision that a patent is bad, either on the facts or on the law, is as binding as one that it is good. The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co. \n228 \nU.S. 22, 25\n, 57 S. L. ed. 716, 717, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410. And nothing can be clearer than that the district court, which has jurisdiction of all crimes cognizable under the authority of the United States (Judicial Code of March 3, 1911, chap. 231 ,  24, second [36 Stat. at L. 1091, Comp. Stat. 1913,  991 (2)]), acts equally within its jurisdiction whether it decides a man to be guilty or innocent under the criminal law, and whether its decision is right or wrong. The objection that the indictment does not charge a crime against the United States goes only to the merits of the case.\n As to the construction of the Constitution being involved, it obviously is not. The question is in what sense the word 'offier' is used in the Criminal Code of March 4, 1909, cahp. 321,  32 [35 Stat. at L. 1095, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,196]. The same words may have different meanings in different parts of the same act, and of course words may be used in a statute in a different sense from that in which they are used in the Constitution. American Security & T. Co. v. District of Columbia, \n224 \nU.S. 491, 494\n, 56 S. L. ed. 856, 857, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 553.\n There were fainter suggestions that the defendant's constitutional rights were infringed because the nature of the fraud intended was not set forth, and because the state and district wherein the crime was committed were not proved. The indictment is not for defrauding, but for personation with intent to defraud; the nature of the fraud intended is not material and even might not yet have been determined. It is not an indictment for a conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, where the offense intended must be shown to be a substantive crime. It reasonably may be inferred from the evidence that the defendant was tried in the right state and district in fact. If so, his constitutional rights were preserved. The personation was by telephone to a person \n\n[240 U.S. 60, 66]\n\u00a0\n in New York (southern district), and it might be found that the speaker also was in the southern district; but if not, at all events the personation took effect there.

KATHLEEN OIL CO.(1916)\nNo. 336\nArgued: Decided: June 12, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 551, 552]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William F. Tucker and Hulette F. Aby for appellants.\n Messrs. George S. Ramsey, Edgar A. de Meules, Malcolm E. Rosser, Sol. H. Kauffman, and Edward H. Chandler for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n This direct appeal is prosecuted to reverse the decree of the court below, dismissing the suit on the ground that the bill alleged no cause of action within the jurisdiction of the court as a Federal court.\n Briefly summarized, the bill alleged that in 1903 Lizzie Brown received from the United States a patent to certain \n\n[241 U.S. 551, 553]\n\u00a0\n described land in Oklahoma as her homestead allotment as a member of the Creek Tribe of Indians; that she died in March, 1912, leaving surviving as her sole heirs her husband, Josiah Brown, and four minor children, all of whom were made defendants. It was alleged that Brown, the father, was appointed guardian of the children, and that in April, 1912, he and the children, as owners in fee of the land in question, made an oil and gas mining lease to the plaintiffs, which was recorded April 18th, 1912; that, notwithstanding this lease, about two months later, that is, June 2d, 1912, Brown, on his own behalf and as guardian, made an oil and gas mining lease covering the identical land, to the Kathleen Oil Company, also made a defendant, which lease was approved by the Secretary of the Interior and was duly recorded. It was alleged that plaintiffs entered upon the land under their lease, prepared to drill for oil, but, learning of the subsequent lease to the Kathleen Oil Company, withdrew and made an application to the Secretary of the Interior to cancel his approval of that lease, which was denied. It was averred that the Kathleen Oil Company had entered into its lease with full knowledge of the prior lease to the plaintiffs, but that it had nevertheless gone into possession and was operating under its lease, and was producing and selling oil and gas. The bill then alleged that the plaintiffs' lease, although not approved by the Secretary, was valid, and that the subsequent lease to the defendant company, which was approved by the Secretary of the Interior, was void because, by the act of Congress of May 27, 1908 (35 Stat. at L. 312, chap. 199), the land of Lizzie Brown descended to her heirs free from any restriction against leasing the same for oil and gas mining purposes, and because, if that act did impose restrictions as to such a lease, it was void for repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States. The prayer was that the defendant company be enjoined from entering on the land and from \n\n[241 U.S. 551, 554]\n\u00a0\n continuing to operate under its lease, that all the defendants be restrained from interfering in any manner with the plaintiffs in conducting operations under their lease, and from asserting or claiming any right to the oil and gas deposits under the land, or the right to mine and remove the same, and that the defendant company account to the plaintiffs for the gas and oil which it had removed.\n The defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that the court was without jurisdiction as a Federal court to entertain the cause. The motion was granted, and a decree of dismissal entered, and, for the purpose of this direct appeal, the court certified under the statute that the dismissal had been ordered because 'the essential and appropriate allegations of the cause of action asserted in said bill of complaint did not disclose a case arising under the Constitution or a law or treaty of the United States.'\n As it is apparent that the court below erred if the allegations concerning the validity of the lease of the plaintiffs, and the invalidity of that of the defendant company, were material to the cause of action stated in the bill, we come at once to that question. In support of the proposition that such allegations were not material, it is argued that the suit was the equivalent of an action at law in ejectment to recover possession of the leased premises, but was brought in equity because, under the law of Oklahoma, a lessee of an oil and gas mining lease under circumstances here disclosed had no right to sue in ejectment. Kolachny v. Galbreath, 26 Okla. 772, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 451, 110 Pac. 902. Further, it is said that as, in a suit in ejectment, it is only necessary to allege a right of possession by the plaintiff, and a wrongful possession by the defendant, averments by anticipation of assumed defects in the plaintiffs' title, to be alleged by the defendant, and of the causes which would be relied upon to establish want of title in the defendant, are not relevant or essential, and are to be disregarded in determin- \n\n[241 U.S. 551, 555]\n\u00a0\n ing the question of the jurisdiction of the court as a Federal court. This, it is said was expressly decided in Taylor v. Anderson, \n234 U.S. 74\n, 58 L. ed. 1218, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 724, and that case is relied upon as conclusive of this controversy.\n But without questioning in the slightest degree the doctrine expounded or the conclusion reached in the Taylor Case, we think it can here have no application, since we are of the opinion that the assumption that the cause of action alleged in the bill under consideration is the equivalent of a suit in ejectment is wholly without foundation. We say this because the prayer of the bill makes it clear that the object of the suit was not only the recovery of possession, but also an injunction forever restraining the defendant company from asserting any rights under its lease, and from interfering with the rights of the plaintiffs under their lease. Such relief, it is apparent, could be granted only after determining the rights of the parties under their respective leases, which would require a construction of the act of Congress referred to as well as a decision concerning the authority of the Secretary of the Interior in approving the defendant company's lease, and the effect to be given to such approval.\n It is said, however, if the bill be thus construed, the suit is in substance one to quiet title, and, under the well-settled rule, such a suit can be brought only by one in possession. Whitehead v. Shattuck, \n138 U.S. 146\n, 34 L. ed. 873, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276; Boston & M. Consol. Copper & S. Min. Co. v. Montana Ore Purchasing Co. \n188 U.S. 632\n, 47 L. ed. 626, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 434. But this contention overlooks the reason upon which the rule is based, as pointed out in the cases relied upon, which is that one out of possession has an adequate remedy at law by a suit in ejectment. As it is conceded that the legal remedy was not here available, and that there was hence jurisdiction in a court of equity to determine the right of possession, it is clear that the rule has no application, and that the court had equitable jurisdiction to determine all the issues presented by the bill. \n\n[241 U.S. 551, 556]\n\u00a0\n That the bill, as thus construed, states a cause of action within the jurisdiction of the court below as a Federal court, is, in substance, conceded, and is demonstrated by the ruling in Wilson Cypress Co. v. Del Pozo y Marcos, \n236 \nU.S. 635, 643\n, 644 S., 59 L. ed. 758, 766, 767, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 446.\n It follows from what we have said that the court below erred in dismissing the cause for want of jurisdiction as a Federal court, and its decree must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLANE v.

Kappler and Harry L.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The relators, who are defendants in error, invoked the aid of the trial court to control by mandamus the action of the Secretary of the Interior concerning an allotment in severalty of land made to an Indian in pursuance of the authority conferred by the act of February 8, 1887 (chap. 119, 24 Stat. at L. 388, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4195), entitled, 'An Act to Provide for the Allotment of Lands in Severalty to Indians on the Various Reservations.' Under the facts stated in his return to the alternative rule, the Secretary, asserting that the land embraced by the allotment in question was held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the allottee, and that the official action sought to be prohibited was not subject to judicial control, because it was one of exclusive administrative authority, denied that there was a right to grant the relief prayed. The return was demurred to as stating no ground for withholding the relief. The trial court overruled the demurrer and discharged the rule, but the court below reversed, and, holding that the Secretary had no power to take the action which it was alleged he intended to take concerning the allotment in question, awarded the mandamus prayed ( 43 App. D. C. 414), and the correctness of this ruling is the question now to be decided.\n The facts are these: Tiebault was a Winnebago Indian living on the tribal reservation in Nebraska, and in August, 1887, received an allotment in severalty of the tribal land to which he was entitled, made in virtue of the act of 1887. That act, after conferring authority upon the Secretary of the Interior to make allotments of tribal lands as therein specified, directed that official to issue \n\n[241 U.S. 201, 205]\n\u00a0\n to the allottees patents, which 'shall be of the legal effect, and declare that the United States does and will hold the lands thus allotted, for the period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotment shall have been made, or, in case of his decease, of his heirs according to the laws of the state or territory where such land is located, and that at the expiration of said period the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian, or his heirs as aforesaid, in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or encumbrance whatsoever: Provided, That the President of the United States may in any case in his discretion extend the period.' (Section 5.)\n About ten years after the allotment Tiebault, having continued to reside on the land and to enjoy the same conformably to the statute, began proceedings in the court of Thurston county, Nebraska, for the adoption as his children of the two relators, who were also Winnebago Indians, and a decree of adoption as prayed was entered. When, ten years after the adoption, Tiebault died without surviving issue, the adopted children, asserting rights as his sole heirs, sought the possession of the land embraced by the allotment and of some other land which had also been covered by an allotment made to a daughter of Tiebault, who died before him without issue, and which land he had therefore inherited. This claim of heirship was disputed by nephews and nieces of Tiebault claiming to be his next of kin. The result was the commencement of proceedings in the district court of the United States for the district of Nebraska on the part of the adopted children to obtain a recognition of their right of heirship, the nephews and neices being among the parties defendant. Considerable testimony was taken, but no decree was entered because, by the act of May 8, 1906 (chap. 2348, 34 Stat. at L. 182), and the act of June 25, 1910 (chap. 431,  1, 36 Stat. at L. 855, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4226), it resulted that the district court was \n\n[241 U.S. 201, 206]\n\u00a0\n without power to proceed further, exclusive jurisdiction over the subject having been conferred by the acts in question upon the Secretary of the Interior. The pertinent provisions of the act last referred to are in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The theater of the controversy was therefore, by the assent of the parties and of the United States, transferred to the Interior Department, where testimony was begun before an examiner, and the Secretary of the Interior, in June, 1913, entered an order in favor of the adopted children, holding them to be the lawful heirs of Tiebault, and entitled under the statute to the ownership and enjoyment of the allotted lands.\n The Secretary having been given authority both by the 6th section of the act of 1906 and by the provisions of the act of 1910, which we have quoted, to reduce the twenty-five-year period, the recognized heirs applied for an order terminating the trust period and for the issue to them of a fee-simple patent. This application was opposed by the next of kin, who had been parties to the previous proceeding as to heirship, and they also asked \n\n[241 U.S. 201, 207]\n\u00a0\n to be permitted to reopen the controversy as to the validity of the adoption and the heirship resulting from it, on the ground that, as the result of newly discovered evidence, they desired to show that the Nebraska decree of adoption and the previous administrative order had been obtained by fraud. Under this request it would seem that considerable testimony was taken, but it was never acted upon because the recognized heirs, the relators, disputed the authority of the Secretory to reopen the controversy, on the ground that the previous departmental order recognizing them as heirs was not subject to be reopened or reviewed, and, in any event, that the decree of adoption of the Nebraska court was beyond the competency of the Secretary to review or set aside even upon the charges of fraud which were made. Without passing upon the merits involved in the claim to reopen, or expressing any opinion concerning the conclusiveness of the Nebraska decree, the Secretary granted the application to reopen, and ordered the issues thereon to stand for future consideration. Thereupon the petition for mandamus was filed, to which a return was made, alleging the facts to be as we have stated them, resulting in the judgment of the court below awarding the mandamus which is before us for review.\n It is undoubted that the fee-simple title to the land embraced by the allotment had not passed from the United States, and that, as expressly stated in the granting act, the land was held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the allottees to await the expiration of the trust period fixed by law, when the duty on the part of the United States of conveying the fee of the land would arise. It is equally undoubted under these conditions that the land was under the control, in an administrative sense, of the Land Department for the purpose of carrying out the act of Congress. As there is no dispute, and could be none, concerning the general rule that courts have no \n\n[241 U.S. 201, 208]\n\u00a0\n power to interfere with the performance by the Land Department of the administrative duties devolving upon it, however much they may, when the functions of that Department are at an end, correct, as between proper parties, errors of law committed in the administration of the land laws by the Department, it must follow, unless it be that this case by some exception is taken out of the general rule, that there was no power in the court below to control the action of the Secretary of the Interior, and reversal therefore must follow. United States v. Schurz, \n102 \nU.S. 378, 396\n, 26 S. L. ed. 167, 171; Brown v. Hitchcock, \n173 U.S. 473\n, 43 L. ed. 772, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485; United States ex rel. Knight v. Lane, \n228 U.S. 6\n, 57 L. ed. 709, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 407. But, as the court below rested its conclusion of power solely upon the existence of an assumed exception to the general rule, and as the correctness of that view is the sole ground relied upon to sustain the judgment, that question is the single subject for consideration, and we come to dispose of it.\n The exception rates upon two considerations: (a) The want of power of the Secretary to reopen or reconsider the prior administrative order recognizing the relators as the heirs of the deceased allottee,-an absence of authority which, it is deemed, resulted from the provisions of the act of 1910 which we have previously quoted in the margin; and (b) the further absence of all outhority of the Secretary to disregard the decree of adoption of the Nebraska court by collaterally questioning the same in order to deprive of the status of adoption which that decree, it is insisted, had conclusively fixed as against all the world under the law of Nebraska.\n\n\n (a)\n The first proceeds upon the theory that the provision of the act of 1910 to the effect that the decision of the Secretary recognizing the heirs of a deceased allottee 'shall be final and conclusive' caused the prior order of the Secretary, recognizing the relators as heirs, to completely exhaust his power, and therefore to give a character of absolute finality to such order, even although the prop- \n\n[241 U.S. 201, 209]\n\u00a0\n erty to which it related was yet in the administrative control of the Department because of the trust imposed by the law of the United States until the expiration of the statutory period. But we are of opinion that this is a mistaken view. The words 'final and conclusive' describing the power given to the Secretary must be taken as conferring, and not as limiting or destroying, that authority. In other words, they must be treated as absolutely excluding the right to review in the courts, as had hitherto been the case under the act of 1887, the question of fact as to who were the heirs of an allottee, thereby causing that question to become one within the final and conclusive competency of the administrative authority. As it is obvious that the right to review on proper charges of newly discovered evidence or fraud a previous administrative order while the property to which it related was under administrative control was of the very essence of administrative authority (Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, \n168 U.S. 589\n, 42 L. ed. 591, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 208), it must follow that the construction upheld would not only deprive the Secretary of the final and conclusive authority which the statute in its context contemplated he should have, but would indeed render the administrative power conferred wholly inadequate for the purpose intended by the statute. And it must be further apparent that the inadequacy of authority which the proposition, if accepted, would bring about, could not be supplied, since it would come to pass that, although the property was yet in the control of the United States to carry out the trust, there would be an absence of all power, both in the administrative and judicial tribunals, to correct an order once rendered, however complete might be the proof of the fraud which had procured it.\n But it is said that the purpose of the statute was to give the recognized heir a status which would entitle him to enjoy the allotted land, and not to leave all his rights of \n\n[241 U.S. 201, 210]\n\u00a0\n enjoyment open to changing decisions which might be made during the long period of the trust term, and thus virtually destroy the right of property in favor of the heir which it was the obvious purpose of the statute to protect. But, in last analysis, this is a mere argument seeking to destroy a lawful power by the suggestion of a possible abuse. We say this because, although it be conceded, for the sake of the argument only, that an exercise of power which was plainly an abuse of discretion, depriving of the right which the statute plainly gave, would be subject to correction by the courts, such concession would be here without influence, since there is no basis whatever upon which to rest an assumption of abuse of discretion.\n\n\n (b)\n So far as the Nebraska decree is concerned, the mistake upon which the proposition proceeds is obvious; since, conceding the premise upon which it must rest to be well founded, it affords no ground for preventing by judicial action the exercise by the Secretary of his power to determine the legal heirs, and in doing so to ascertain the existence of the Nebraska judgment, the jurisdiction ratione materioe of the court by which it was rendered, and the legal effect which it was entitled to receive under the law of Nebraska.\n There was a suggestion in argument, which it was conceded was not made in the courts below, of an absolute want of jurisdiction upon the theory that, as the title of the allotted property was yet in the United States for the purposes of the trust, there could in any event be no jurisdiction over the cause, since, in substance and effect, it was a suit against the United States. As, however, the considerations involved in this proposition were absolutely coincident with those required to be taken into view in order to determine the power of the Secretary, we have not deemed it necessary to specially consider the subject.\n It follows from what we have said that the court below was without jurisdiction to control the conduct of the \n\n[241 U.S. 201, 211]\n\u00a0\n Secretary concerning a matter within the administrative authority of that officer, and therefore that the mandamus was wrongfully allowed, and the judgment awarding it must be and it is reversed and the case remanded with directions to affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, dismissing the petition for a writ of mandamus.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'That when any Indian to whom an allotment of land has been made, or may hereafter be made, dies before the expiration of the trust period and before the issuance of a fee-simple patent, without having made a will disposing of said allotment as hereinafter provided, the Secretary of the Interior, upon notice and hearing, under such rules as he may prescribe, shall ascertain the legal heirs of such decedent, and his decision thereon shall be final and conclusive. If the Secretary of the Interior decides the heir or heirs of such decedent competent to manage their own affairs, he shall issue to such heir or heirs a patent in fee for the allotment of such decedent; if he shall decide one or more of the heirs to be incompetent, he may, in his discretion, cause such lands to be sold: Provided, That if the Secretary of the Interior shall find that the lands of the decedent are capable of partition to the advantage of the heirs, he may cause the shares of such as are competent, upon their petition, to be set aside and patents in fee to be issued to them therefor.' \n\n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLATTA & TERRY CONST CO. v.

Edmunds for appellee.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 166, 172]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellant filed a libel in rem in the admiralty against the steamship 'Raithmoor' to recover damages for tort. The steamship, coming up the Delaware river on the evening of July 18, 1909, collided with a scow and pile driver belonging to the appellant, and also with a structure which the appellant was erecting for the United States to serve as a beacon, and with a temporary platform used in connection with the work of construction. For the injury to the scow and pile driver a decree was entered in favor of the libellant. But the district court \n\n[241 U.S. 166, 173]\n\u00a0\n held that there was no jurisdiction in the admiralty of the claim for the damage to the structure and platform, and the libellant appeals. The Raithmoor, 186 Fed. 849.\n The district court thus states the character and location of the structure:\n'The company' (the appellant) 'was executing an independent contract with the United States, which bound them to furnish the necessary materials, labor, plant, etc., and to erect in place a foundation pier to receive a gas beacon. The work was under the continual supervision of a government official, but had neither been finished nor accepted. The structure was to consist of three cylindrical piles of reinforced concrete to be sunk about 19 1\/2 feet into the bottom of the river, and to project 12 feet above mean high water, these to be covered with a sheet steel cap. The piles were to be encased in steel and to be protected also by depositing rip-rap around them to a specified height. When completed, the pier was to be used solely as a beacon on the edge of a navigable channel that has not yet been made ready, and the government was to install upon the cap a lamp and other appliances. The site is 3\/4 of a mile from the eastern or New Jersey shore, and about 2 miles from the western or Delaware shore, of the river, and is surrounded by navigable water, about 27 feet deep at low tide. The work was begun in June, and at the time of the collision was approaching completion. The piles were in place, and not much remained to be done except to put the metal cap into place and deposit the rip-rap. The necessities of the work required a temporary platform to be built close to the concrete piles. This was of wood, about 15 feet square, and rested upon wooden piling driven into the bottom of the river.' Id. p. 850.\n\n The decisions of this court with respect to the jurisdic- \n\n[241 U.S. 166, 174]\n\u00a0\n tion of the admiralty in cases of tort make the question to be determined a very narrow one. In The Plymouth (Hough v. Western Transp. Co.) 3 Wall. 20, 36, 18 L. ed. 125, 128, it was broadly declared that 'the whole, or at least the substantial, cause of action, arising out of the wrong, must be complete within the locality upon which the jurisdiction depends-on the high seas or the navigable waters.' Accordingly it was held that a libel for damage to a wharf and storehouses, caused by a fire started on a vessel through negligence, was beyond the limit of admiralty cognizance, as the damage was wholly done, and the wrong was thus consummated, upon the land. Upon this ground, the jurisdiction of the district court to entertain a petition for the limitation of the liability of the shipowner in such a case was denied in Ex parte Phenix Ins. Co. \n118 U.S. 610\n, 30 L. ed. 274, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 25. The principle was restated in Johnson v. Chicago & P. Elevator Co. \n119 \nU.S. 388, 397\n, 30 S. L. ed. 447, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 254. And see Knapp S. & Co. Co. v. McCaffrey, \n177 \nU.S. 638, 643\n, 44 S. L. ed. 921, 924, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 824; Homer Ramsdell Transp. Co. v. La Compagnie G enerale Transatlantique, \n182 \nU.S. 406, 411\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1155, 1159, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 831. But in The Blackheath (United States v. Evans) \n195 U.S. 361\n, 49 L. ed. 236, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 46, a distinction was drawn, and the jurisdiction of the admiralty was upheld in the case of an injury caused by a vessel in negligently running into a beacon which stood 15 or 20 feet from the channel of Mobile river, or bay, in water 12 or 15 feet deep, and was built on piles driven firmly into the bottom. The court pointed out the essential basis of the decision, in saying: 'It is enough to say that we now are dealing with an injury to a government aid to navigation from ancient times subject to the admiralty,-a beacon emerging from the water, injured by the motion of the vessel, by a continuous act beginning and consummated upon navigable water, and giving character to the effects upon a point which is only technically land, through a connection at the bottom of the sea.' (Id. p. 367.) It was suggested in the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Brown (Id. p. 368) that the decision \n\n[241 U.S. 166, 175]\n\u00a0\n practically overruled the earlier cases, and that it recognized the principle of the English statute extending the jurisdiction of the admiralty court to 'any claim for damages by any ship.' This consequence, however, was expressly denied in Cleveland Terminal & Valley R. Co. v. Cleveland S. S. Co. \n208 \nU.S. 316, 320\n, 52 S. L. ed. 508, 512, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 414, 13 Ann. Cas. 1215. In that case it was decided that the admiralty did not have jurisdiction of a claim for damages caused by a vessel adrift, through its alleged fault, to the center pier of a bridge spanning a navigable river and to a shore abutment and dock. Referring to The Blackheath, and drawing the distinction we have noted, the court said: 'The damage' (that is, in The Blackheath) 'was to property located in navigable waters, solely an aid to navigation and maritime in nature, and having no other purpose or function. . . . But the bridges, shore docks, protection piling, piers, etc.' (of the Cleveland Terminal Company) 'pertained to the land. They were structures connected with the shore and immediately concerned commerce upon land. None of these structures were aids to navigation in the maritime sense, but extensions of the shore, and aids to commerce on land as such.' The decision in The Troy, \n208 U.S. 321\n, 52 L. ed. 512, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 416, was to the same effect. The steamer Troy had collided with the center pier of a swinging span over the St. Louis river, a navigable stream, and the jurisdiction of the admiralty of a libel for the injury was denied. See also Phoenix Constr. Co. v. The Poughkeepsie, \n212 U.S. 558\n, 53 L. ed. 651, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 687; Martin v. West, \n222 \nU.S. 191, 197\n, 56 S. L. ed. 159, 162, 36 L.R.A.(N.S.) 592, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 42.\n If, then, in the present instance, the metal cap of the beacon had been in place, the rip-rap deposited, and the beacon put into actual service, the case would fall exactly within the ruling of The Blackheath, and the admiralty would have jurisdiction although the structure was attached to the bottom. There would be no difference in the two cases which would afford the slightest ground for argument. If, on the other hand, simply because of the \n\n[241 U.S. 166, 176]\n\u00a0\n incompleteness of the beacon, it is to be exclusively identified with the land, and its intended purpose is to be disregarded, the admiralty would have no jurisdiction. We think that a distinction based solely on the fact that the beacon was not fully completed would be a needless refinement,-a nicety in analysis not required by reason or precedent. We regard the location and purpose of the structure as controlling from the time the structure was begun. It was not being built on shore and awaiting the assumption of a maritime relation. It was in course of construction in navigable waters, that is, at a place where the jurisdiction of admiralty in cases of tort normally attached,-at least in all cases where the wrong was of a maritime character. See The Plymouth, supra; Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, \n234 U.S. 52\n, 58-61, 58 L. ed. 1208, 1211, 1212, 51 L.R.A.( N.S.) 1157, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 733, and cases there cited. The relation of the structure to the land was of the most technical sort, merely through the attachment to the bottom; it had no connection, either actual or anticipated, with commerce on land. It was simply to serve as an aid to navigation, and while it had not yet been finished and accepted, it was being erected under the constant supervision of a government inspector acting under the authority of the United States in the improvement and protection of navigation. It is urged that the government might abandon its plan; but there has been no abandonment. The question is not as to an abandoned mass, but as to a beacon in course of erection. Even a completed beacon might be abandoned, and whatever question might arise in such a case is not presented here. Again, an analogy is suggested to the case of a vessel which is being constructed on shore, but the argument falls short, as it is to be remembered that as soon as a vessel is launched, although still incomplete, it is subject to the admiralty jurisdiction. Tucker v. Alexandroff, \n183 \nU.S. 424, 438\n, 46 S. L. ed. 264, 270, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 195. This is not the case of a structure which at any time was identified with the shore, but, from the beginning \n\n[241 U.S. 166, 177]\n\u00a0\n of construction, locality and design gave it a distinctively maritime relation. When completed and in use, its injury by a colliding ship would interfere, or tend to interfere, with its service to navigation; and, while still incomplete, such an injury would tend to postpone that service. We know of no substantial reason why the jurisdiction of the admiralty should be sustained in the one case and denied in the other.\n With respect to the temporary platform, it is to be observed that this was a mere incident to the structure, and as such the jurisdiction would extend to the claim for the damage to it.\n The decree, so far as it dismissed the libel for want of jurisdiction, is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEHON v. CITY OF ATLANTA(1916)\nNo. 103\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. John D. Little, Arthur G. Powell, Marion Smith, and Max F. Goldstein for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Samuel D. Hewlett and Jams L. Mayson for defendant in error. \n\n[242 U.S. 53, 54]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question in the case is the validity of ordinances of the city of Atlanta, Georgia, which subject the business of a private detective or detective agency to police supervision, and provide that no person shall carry on such business without being first recommended by the board of police commissioners, and taking the oath of a city detective, and giving a bond in the sum of $1,000, as prescribed by the ordinances.\n Plaintiff in error was convicted in the recorder's court of the city of a violation of the ordinances, and sentenced to pay a fine, with the alternative of imprisonment. Under the local procedure a petition for certiorari was presented to the judge of the superior court of the county to review the conviction, and was refused 'sanction,' to use the local word. This action was approved by the court of appeals and the judgment affirmed.\n The court of appeals rejected the contention that the ordinances were unreasonable and void under the Constitution of the state, to review which decision we, of course, have no power; and it also sustained the ordinances against the contention that they offended the clauses of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The latter contention is repeated here.\n His contention, in its most general form, is that the ordinances abolish the occupation of private detective by the requirements of application for a permit to the police commission of the city, the approval of the chief of police, oath of office, and to work under police supervision. These requirements, it is insisted, offend the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n The contention makes a Federal question, and, as we are \n\n[242 U.S. 53, 55]\n\u00a0\n not disposed to consider it frivolous, a motion to dismiss which is made will be denied.\n In passing upon the merits we assume the facts of the complaint were established; that is, that plaintiff in error was proved to have acted as a private detective, though he denied and denies it, and that his services were those of a 'sleuth,' though he asserts they were only those of a clerk. We make these assumptions against the denials of plaintiff in error because, to sustain the denials, he selects parts of the testimony only, and ignores also the deduction that it was possible to make even from that testimony.\n The only question for our decision is the validity of the law, and of that we have no doubt. Nor are we disposed to take much time in its discussion, notwithstanding the earnest argument of plaintiff in error. The extent of the police power of the state has been too recently explained to need further enunciation. The present case is easily within its principle. It would be very commonplace to say that the exercise of police is one of the necessary activities of government, and all that pertains to it may be subjected to regulation and surveillance as a precaution against perversion. The Atlanta ordinances do no more. They provide in effect that all who engage in it or are connected with it as a business shall have the sanction of the state, have the stamp of the state as to fitness and character, take an oath to the state for faithful execution of its duties, and give a bond for their sanction. This the state may do against its own citizens and may do against a citizen of Louisiana, which plaintiff in error is, or against a citizen of any other state.\n But the ruling of the local officers in refusing approval of applications of nonresidents of Georgia is urged as a construction of the ordinances or laws of the state, and, it is contended, makes them discriminatory against citizens of other states. Plaintiff in error, however, ad- \n\n[242 U.S. 53, 56]\n\u00a0\n mits he made no effort to comply with the ordinances. The court of appeals, therefore, was of opinion that, whether certain sections of the Penal Code of the state did or did not exclude citizens of other states from engaging as private detectives, plaintiff in error was deprived of no constitutional right, for 'as to him the ordinances were not construed at all.' In other words, that he had not asserted a right, and, in the obsence of assertion, could not have it judicially passed on. We concur in the ruling. It is within the principle of Gundling v. Chicago, \n177 U.S. 183\n, 44 L. ed. 725, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 633. To complain of a ruling, one must be made the victim of it. One cannot invoke, to defeat a law, an apprehension of what might be done under it, and which, if done, might not receive judicial approval.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEVINDALE LEAD & ZINC MIN. CO. v. COLEMAN(1916)\nNo. 322\nArgued: April 25, 1916Decided: June 5, 1916\n\n\n\n Mr. H. P. White for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Preston A. Shinn for defendant in error. \n\n[241 U.S. 432, 433]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n Charles Coleman, the defendant in error, brought this suit to set aside a conveyance of an undivided interest in lands inherited from his Indian wife and child, who were members of the Osage Tribe. Judgment was entered annulling the conveyance upon the ground that it was executed in violation of restrictions imposed by Congress. The judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state (43 Okla. 13, 140 Pac. 607), and this writ of error has been sued out.\n The case was decided upon a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and there were special findings of the facts which the pleadings disclosed. It appears that the plaintiff, Charles Coleman, was a white man, lawfully married to an Indian woman, Mary Chesewalla; that their child, Joseph Coleman, was born on February 27, 1906, and died on the same day, leaving his father and mother his sole heirs; that his mother died intestate on February 28, 1906, leaving as her sole heirs Charles Coleman, Herbert Chesewalla, and Floyd Chesewalla; that both decedents were duly enrolled as members of the Osage Tribe, and were entitled to allotments under the act of Congress of June 28, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 539, chap. 3572); and that, after their death, allotments were made in their right to the heirs of each respectively, the allotment deeds being approved by the Secretary of the Interior and recorded in the year 1909. By the death of his wife and child the plaintiff took title as heir to an undivided one-half interest in the lands allotted in the right of the former, and to an undivided three-fourths interest in lands allotted in the right of the latter. These lands have not been partitioned. In February, 1909, Charles Coleman conveyed by warranty deed his undivided interest to the defendant ( plaintiff in error) the Levindale Lead & Zinc Mining Company. It is further set forth that his wife had not received \n\n[241 U.S. 432, 434]\n\u00a0\n a certificate of competency. There was no finding and no basis in the record for a finding that Charles Coleman was a member of the Osage Tribe by adoption, enrolment, or otherwise.\n The lands prior to the allotment were Indian lands (17 Stat. at L. 228, chap. 310), and there is no controversy as to the power of Congress, in providing for allotments, to impose restrictions upon alienation. The question is as to the construction of the provisions of the allotment act of June 28, 1906\n\n\n That act provided that the roll of the Osage Tribe as it existed on January 1, 1906, with the additions specified, should be the roll of the tribe and constitute its 'legal membership.' Children born between January 1, 1906, and July 1, 1907, to persons whose names were on the roll on the first-mentioned date, 'including the children of members of the tribe who have, or have had, white husbands,' were to be recognized as members for the purposes of the division. (Sec. 1.) All lands were to be divided 'among the members of said tribe, giving to each his or her fair share thereof in acres' as specifically set forth; that is, 'each member' as shown by the roll was to be allowed to make three selections of 160 acres each in the manner described. (Sec. 2.) Restrictions were imposed as follows:\n'Each member of said tribe shall be permitted to designate which of his three selections shall be a homestead, and his certificate of allotment and deed shall designate the same as a homestead, and the same shall be inalienable and nontaxable until otherwise provided by act of Congress. The other two selections of each member, together with his share of the remaining lands allotted to the momber, shall be known as surplus land, and shall be inalienable for twenty-five years, except as hereinafter provided.' (Sec. 2, Fourth.)\n\n After 'each member' had made the three selections, the \n\n[241 U.S. 432, 435]\n\u00a0\n remaining lands of the tribe, except as stated, were to be divided 'as equally as practicable among said members by a commission to be appointed.' (Sec. 2, Fifth.) The Secretary of the Interior in his discretion, at the request of any 'adult member of the tribe,' was to issue 'to such member a certificate of competency, authorizing him to sell and convey any of the lands deeded him by reason of this act, except his homestead, which shall remain inalienable and nontaxable for a period of twenty-five years, or during the life of the homestead allottee,' if, upon investigation, 'he shall find any such member fully competent' to care for his affairs. It was provided that upon the issuance of such a certificate of competency the lands of such 'member,' except homestead lands, should 'become subject to taxation,' and that 'such member,' except as provided, should have the right to 'manage, control and dispose of his or her lands the same as any citizen of the United States.' It was further provided that the surplus lands should be 'nontaxable' for the period of three years from the approval of the act 'except where certificates of competency are issued or in case of the death of the allottee, unless otherwise provided by Congress.' (Sec. 2, Seventh.) Oil, gas, coal or other minerals 'covered by the lands' were 'reserved to the Osage Tribe for a period of twenty-five years.' (Id.  3.) All funds belonging to the tribe, and moneys accruing to it, were to be 'held in trust by the United States for the period of twenty-five years' from January 1, 1907, except as provided. The funds of the tribe, and moneys accruing from the sale of Kansas lands, together with those due upon claims against the United States, were to be segregated and placed to the credit of the 'individual members' of the tribe 'on a basis of a pro rata division,' or 'to their heirs as hereinafter provided,' and such credit was to draw interest, to be 'paid quarterly to the members entitled thereto;' and the disposition of royal- \n\n[241 U.S. 432, 436]\n\u00a0\n ties from mineral leases was specially prescribed. (Sec. 4.) At the expiration of twenty-five years from January 1, 1907, the lands, mineral interests, and moneys held in trust by the United States were to be the absolute property of the 'individual members' of the tribe, according to the roll, 'or their heirs, as herein provided,' and deeds were to be issued accordingly. (Sec. 5.) Sections 6 and 7 are as follows:\n'Sec. 6. That the lands, moneys, and mineral interests, herein provided for, of any deceased member of the Osage Tribe shall descend to his or her legal heirs, according to the laws of the territory of Oklahoma, or of the state in which said reservation may be hereinafter incorporated, except where the decedent leaves no issue, nor husband nor wife, in which case said lands, moneys, and mineral interests, must go to the mother and father equally.\n\n Sec. 7. That the lands herein provided for are set aside for the sole use and benefit of the individual members of the tribe entitled thereto, or to their heirs, as herein provided; and said members, or their heirs, shall have the right to use and to lease said lands for farming, grazing, or any other purpose not otherwise specifically provided for herein, and said members shall have full control of the same, including the proceeds thereof: Provided, That parents of minor members of the tribe shall have the control and use of said minors' lands, together with the proceeds of the same, until said minors arrive at their majority: And provided further, That all leases given on said lands for the benefit of the individual members of the tribe entitled thereto, or for their heirs, shall be subject only to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.'\n Deeds to the Osage lands were to be executed by the principal chief, but were not to be valid until approved by the Secretary of the Interior ( 8), and it was further provided that whatever was necessary to carry into effect the provisions of the act should be done under the au- \n\n[241 U.S. 432, 437]\n\u00a0\n thority of this officer ( 12). Regulations have been adopted by the Secretary of the Interior governing the leasing (under  7, 12) of lands 'allotted to Osage Indians.' These provide, among other things, that 'lands of deceased allottees may be leased by the heirs jointly,' as stated. (Regulations 11, 12, approved October 25, 1910; 8, approved June 17, 1913.)\n The provisions of the allotment act must be construed in the light of the policy they were obviously intended to execute. It was a policy relating to the welfare of Indians,-wards of the United States. The establishment of restrictions against alienation 'evinced the continuance, to this extent, at least, of the guardianship which the United States had exercised from the beginning.' Heckman v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 413, 436\n, 56 S. L. ed. 820, 829, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 424; United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375, 384\n, 30 S. L. ed. 228, 230, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1109; United States v. Rickert, \n188 \nU.S. 432, 437\n, 438 S., 47 L. ed. 532, 536, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478; Marchie Tiger v. Western Invest. Co. \n221 \nU.S. 286, 316\n, 55 S. L. ed. 738, 749, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 578; Williams v. Johnson, \n239 \nU.S. 414, 420\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 150. This policy did not embrace white men,-persons not of Indian blood,-who were not as Indians under national protection, although they might inherit lands from Indians; and, with respect to such persons, it would require clear language to show an intent to impose restrictions.\n Taken in thier natural sense, the provisions of the fourth paragraph of  2 apply only to allotments made to members of the tribe. There is nothing to suggest that a nonmember should designate a 'homestead,' and unless lands were thus segregated the restrictions as to 'homesteads' would not apply. With respect to 'surplus lands,' it will be observed that it is only selections of each 'member,' and the share of remaining lands 'allotted to the member,' which constitute lands so described and thus come under the stated restrictions. It was early ruled administratively that under  6 the right to the member's share, though unallotted in his lifetime, passed to his legal heirs as there \n\n[241 U.S. 432, 438]\n\u00a0\n defined, and this we assume to be the meaning of the statute. But the fact that the nonmember takes in the right of the deceased member is not enough to subject him to restrictions which are plainly imposed for the protection of members. It is urged that the restrictions, by virtue of their terms, were to run with the land until they expired by limitation or were removed (Bowling v. United States, \n233 U.S. 528\n, 58 L. ed. 1080, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 659), but restrictions would not run with the land unless they had attached. And, even where they had attached, they would run only according to the intendment of the statute. We find no indication of an intent that they should apply to lands, or an interest in lands, which had come lawfully into the ownership of white men who were nonmembers of the tribe. Emphasis is placed by the defendant in error on the provisions of  7 as to leases; but it would be an inadmissible construction of this section to say that the word 'heirs' was there used in contradistinction to 'members.' This provision as to leases, in the light of the purpose of the act, had reference, we think, to the 'individual members' who received allotments and the Indian heirs of such members.\n The view we have taken of the inapplicability of the restrictions upon alienation in a case like the present finds support in the fact that there was no provision for giving to nonmembers certificates of competency. Under the seventh paragraph of  2, any 'adult member' of the tribe, although a full-blood Indian, who could satisfy the Secretary of the Interior of his ability to transact his own business, might obtain a certificate and thus be enabled to dispose of his 'surplus land;' but a competent white man, not a member, could not be relieved. It would seem to be evident that such an incongruous result was not intended, the language plainly showing that Indians alone were deemed to be subjected to the restrictions.\n It is insisted that subsequent legislation in pari materia indicates the contrary. Reference is made to the acts \n\n[241 U.S. 432, 439]\n\u00a0\n of March 3, 1909 (35 Stat. at L. 778, chap. 256), and of April 18, 1912 ( 37 Stat. at L. 86, chap. 83). The former does not aid this contention, but is rather opposed to it: The statute authorized the Secretary of the Interior to sell 'part or all of the surplus lands of any member' of the Osage Tribe, but contained no authority to deal with lands of nonmembers. It will also be observed that prior to this act there was a joint resolution of February 27, 1909 (35 Stat. at L. 1167), providing that 'homesteads of members of the Osage Tribe' may consist of land designated from any one or more 'of their first three allotment selections;' this does not suggest that nonmembers were supposed to designate 'homesteads.' But it is the act of 1912 upon which chief reliance is placed. This was 'supplementary to and amendatory of' the act of 1906, and provides, among other things, in  6, relating to the lands 'of deceased Osage allottees,' that 'when the heirs of such deceased allottees have certificates of competency or are not members of the tribe, the restrictions on alienation are hereby removed.' We lay aside the suggestion that 'deceased Osage allottees' may be taken to mean only members who received allotments in their own right while living, expressing no opinion upon that point. For not only is a legislative declaration of the intent of a previous act not absolutely controlling, but we think that in the present instance the purpose of Congress is manifest. This suit had been decided in the district court of the state in December, 1910, and it had been there held that the restriction applied to nonmembers. The case had been appealed, but it may well be supposed that Congress intended to remove the restriction upon a nonmember, if such a restriction could be deemed to exist. That, we are satisfied, was the object of the provision, and it was not an attempt to import into the earlier act a restriction which lay wholly outside its express terms and the policy of guardianship it was intended to execute.\n We confine ourselves to the single point presented. There is no controversy whatever as to the authority of the Secretary of the Interior, where there are undivided interests belonging to Indians, adequately to protect those interests according to the statutory provisions to this end. Our conclusion simply is that the act of 1906 placed no restrictions upon the alienation of land, or undivided interests in land, of which white men who were not members of the tribe became owners.\n The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLINCOLN v.

Merton E. Lewis, C. T. Dawes, and Mr. E. E. Woodbury, Attorney General of New York, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Clarke delivered the opinion of the court:\n This proceeding was commenced in the supreme court of New York by the Long Sault Development Company, hereinafter called the plaintiff, for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of an act of the legislature of that state, passed in 1907, to incorporate the plaintiff and to grant to it important rights in the bed of, and with respect to the use of the waters of, the St. Lawrence river. Laws of 1907, chap. 355.\n The case is now in this court on the claim that this Act of 1907 is a valid law, and that the property rights springing from the grants therein and the acceptance of them by the plaintiff were impaired by a later act, passed in 1913, purporting to repeal the Act of 1907, and by the effect given to this later act by the decision of the court of appeals, rendered in June, 1914.\n The title of the Act of 1907 indicates the comprehensive character of the grants which the legislature attempted to make by it. It reads as follows: 'An Act to Incorporate the Long Sault Development Company, and to Authorize Said Company to Construct and Maintain Dams, Canals, Powerhouses, and Locks at or near Long Sault Island, for the Purpose of Improving the Navigation of the St. Lawrence River and Developing Power from the Waters Thereof, and to Construct and Maintain a Bridge, and Carry on the Manufacture of Commodities.'\n The act proceeds, first, to incorporate the Long Sault Development Company, giving it perpetual corporate \n\n[242 U.S. 272, 274]\n\u00a0\n existence, and then in terms to authorize it to construct, maintain, and operate dams, canals, reservoirs, and the appurtenances necessary or useful for the purpose of developing water power and electrical energy, at such point or points adjacent to the south shore of the St. Lawrence river, and in and upon the river bed near Long Sault island or Barnhart's island, as may be selected by the company; to erect and maintain power houses and electrical transmission appliances; and to construct a bridge or bridges across the river, in connection with the dam authorized, and to charge tolls for passage thereon.\n These important rights are declared to be granted upon various specified conditions, the most important of which is 'that the rights hereby granted shall never be so used as to impair or obstruct the navigation of the Saint Lawrence river, but, on the contrary, that such navigation shall be preserved in as good condition as, if not better than, the same is at present, regard being always had to the amount of the natural flow of water in said river as affecting its navigability from time to time.' [Section 3.]\n The act further provides that, after the Congress of the United States shall authorize the construction of the proposed dams, locks, and canals, and after the payment of certain sums of money into the state treasury, then the Commissioners of the Land Office shall, upon application of said corporation, ' grant unto it the title and interest of the people of the state in and to lands under the waters of the Saint Lawrence river to be covered or occupied by said works and locks and power houses.' [Section 4.] The payments to be made, after the year 1911, shall be not less than $25,000 for each year. The petition alleges that the river at Long Sault rapids is now practically unnavigable, being navigated only by light draft passenger vessels down stream during the summer tourist season, and that all other traffic up and down the river passes around the rapids by wat of the Cornwall canal, on the Canadian side of the river. \n\n[242 U.S. 272, 275]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff was duly organized as a corporation, and expended a large sum of money in preparing to utilize the grants of the act.\n By an act which became a law on the 8th day of May, 1913, the legislature of the state in terms repealed this Act of 1907, under which the plaintiff in error is claiming.\n Almost three months before this repealing act was passed, this suit was commenced by the filing of a petition in the supreme court of New York, praying for a writ of mandamus, to be directed to the treasurer of that state, requiring him to receive as a payment into the treasury of the state the sum of $25,000, as a sum due and payable on February 1st, 1913, for the year 1912, under the provisions of the Act of 1907, which sum had theretofore been tendered to the treasurer and had been by him refused, for the reason, it is alleged, that he had been advised by the attorney general of the state that said act was unconstitutional and void. The application of the petitioner for a writ of mandamus was denied by the supreme court, and this decision was affirmed by the appellate division and by the court of appeals, which ordered the record in the case remitted to the supreme court, to be proceeded upon according to law.\n Up to this time there is nothing in the record before us to indicate that any question was presented to the state courts, excepting the single one as to whether or not the Act of 1907 was valid under the Constitution of the state of New York.\n More than a month later, on the 14th day of July, 1914, the court of appeals, on motion of the plaintiff, requested the supreme court to return the remittitur to the court of appeals, which court then amended the same by incorporating therein the statement that 'upon the argument of the appeal in this cause before the court of appeals' there was submitted a brief, containing five \n\n[242 U.S. 272, 276]\n\u00a0\n specified points. Of these in 'Point III.' alone counsel for the plaintiff for the first time, and then only by way of argument, attempt to present a Federal question by claiming that if the repealing act is to be regarded as an attempted condemnation of the special franchises claimed by the plaintiff, it 'would be unconstitutional in that such franchises were not taken by the state for public use,' in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n It is significant to note that the court of appeals, in its decision, rendered before the remittitur was thus amended, did not treat or regard the repealing act as 'an attempted condemnation of the special franchises claimed by the plaintiff,' nor did it afterwards so treat it.\n Upon the record thus described the plaintiff in error comes into this court, claiming that the act of the legislature of the state of New York of 1907 is a valid, constitutional law, and that, it having been accepted and acted upon by the plaintiff, contract and other property rights resulted which, under the decision of the court of appeals, have been impaired or taken away by the repealing act of 1913, in violation of the Constitution of the United States and of the 14th Amendment thereto, and it therefore prays for a reversal of the judgment of the supreme court, entered pursuant to the decision of the court of appeals.\n The defendant in error meets this claim of the plaintiff by a denial of the jurisdiction of this court, for the claimed reason that the court of appeals reached the conclusion that the Act of 1907 was unconstitutional and void without reference to, and without giving any effect to, the subsequent repealing statute.\n The grants of the Act of 1907 are such that, if it was a valied law, upon their being accepted, they constituted property or contract rights, of which the plaintiff could not be deprived, and which could not be impaired, by \n\n[242 U.S. 272, 277]\n\u00a0\n subsequent legislation, and, therefore, the denial by the defendant in error of the jurisdiction of this court renders it necessary for us to determine whether the court of appeals, in its decision, gave any effect to the repealing act. If it did not give effect to that act, either expressly or by implication, this court is without jurisdiction to review its decision, for the reason that the provisions of the Constitution of the United States for the protection of contract rights are directed only against the impairment of them by constitutions or laws adopted or passed subsequent to the date of the contract from which such rights spring, and do not reach decisions of courts construing constitutions or laws which were in effect when the contract was entered into, as has been held by a long line of decisions extending from Knox v. Exchange Bank, 12 Wall. 379, 20 L. ed. 414, to Cross Lake Shooting & Fishing Club v. Louisiana, \n224 U.S. 63\ni 56 .l. ed. 924, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 577.\n In deciding this question, this court is not limited to the mere consideration of the language of the opinion of the state court, but will consider the substance and effect of the decision, and will for itself determine what effect, if any, was given by it to the repealing act. Fisher v. New Orleans, \n218 U.S. 438\n, 54 L. ed. 1099, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 57; Cross Lake Shooting & Fishing Club v. Louisiana, \n224 U.S. 632\n, 56 L. ed. 924, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 577, and Louisiana R. & Nav. Co. v. Behrman, \n235 U.S. 164\n, 59 L. ed. 175, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 62. While this court will exercise independent judgment as to the scope of the decision of the state court, it will give to that decision that respectful and sympathetic attention which is always due to the highest court of a state (Fisher v. New Orleans, supra), with the presumption always in mind that the state courts will do what the Constitution and laws of the United States require. Neal v. Delaware, \n103 \nU.S. 370, 389\n, 26 S.

Rep. 905, and Defiance Water Co. v. Defiance, \n191 U.S. 184\n, 48 L. ed. 140, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 63. \n\n[242 U.S. 272, 278]\n\u00a0\n An examination of the opinion of the court of appeals shows that the court, in its consideration of the repealing act of 1913, not only did not give to it an effect which would impair any contract relation springing from the Act of 1907, but that, on the contrary, it concluded that the repeal 'could not operate to confiscate any valid franchise or property right which the Long Sault Development Company had previously acquired under the act repealed,' and that this conclusion made it necessary for the court to 'consider and determine whether the legislature possessed the constitutional power to convey away the state control over the navigation of the St. Lawrence river to the extent attempted by the Act of 1907.' [ 212 N. Y. 8, 105 N. E. 849, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 56.]\n And then, addressing itself to the constitutional problem thus stated, the court proceeds, upon principle and authority, to decide: That, under the Constitution of the state of New York, the power of the legislature of that state to grant lands under navigable waters to private persons or corporations is limited to purposes which may be useful, convenient, or necessary to the public; that it has no power to so part with the title to such lands that the state may not in the future improve navigation over them, if the public interest shall so require; and that they are held by the state on such a trust for the public use that the legislature has no power to authorize the conveyance of them to a private corporation to maintain navigation thereover 'in as good condition as . . . at present,' thereby parting for all time with its power to improve such navigation.\n The court finds its principal authority for these legal positions in the decision of this court in Illinois C. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n146 U.S. 387\n, 36 L. ed. 1018, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 110, in which it was decided: That the title which a state holds to land under navigable waters is different in character from that which it holds in land intended for sale and occupation; in the former case it being held in trust for the people of the \n\n[242 U.S. 272, 279]\n\u00a0\n state, in order that they may enjoy the navigation of the waters and carry on commerce over them, free from obstruction or interference by private parties; that this trust devolving upon the state in the public interest is one which cannot be relinquishd by a transfer of the property; that a state can no more abdicate its trust over such property, in which the whole people are interested, so as to leave it under the control of private parties, than it can abdicate its police powers in the administration of government and the preservation of the peace, and that the trust under which such lands are held is governmental, so that they cannot be alienated, except to be used for the improvement of the public use in them.\n This was a pioneer decision upon the subject at the time it was rendered by a divided court, but the principles upon which it proceeds have been frequently approved by this court. Morris v. United States, \n174 U.S. 196\n, 43 L. ed. 946, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 649; United States v. Mission Rock Co. \n189 \nU.S. 391, 406\n, 47 S. L. ed. 865, 869, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 606; Kean v. Calumet Canal & Improv. Co. \n190 \nU.S. 452, 481\n, 47 S. L. ed. 1134, 1145, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651; and they have been very widely approved by many of the highest courts of the states of the Union. Rose's Notes on U. S. Reports, vol. 12, p. 270; Supp. 3, p. 291; Supp. 5, p. 369.\n Having arrived at these conclusions of law, the court of appeals proceeds to make application of them to the Act of 1907, and concludes that that act, in terms, virtually turns over to the corporation the entire control of the navigation of the Long Sault rapids (provided that the consent of Congress to the grant could be obtained), requiring only that the company shall pay certain stipulated sums of money, and that it shall preserve the navigation of the river 'in as good condition as . . . the same is at present,' and says that, no matter how much the interest of the public might demand the improvement of the river in the future, the state would be powerless to act, either directly or by constraint upon the corporation; and for this reason it concludes that the act is, in substance, an abdica- \n\n[242 U.S. 272, 280]\n\u00a0\n tion of the trust upon which the state holds control over the St. Lawrence river as navigable water and that, therefore, it is unconstitutional and void. Whether this construction placed upon the act is the one which this court would place upon it if coming to an original interpretation of it, we need not inquire; for, under the authorities hereinbefore cited, the prohibition of the Constitution against the impairing of contracts by state legislation does not reach errors committed by state courts when passing upon the validity and effect of a contract under a constitution or laws existing when it is made.\n This discussion of the decision by the court of appeals makes it very clear that that decision does not give any effect whatever to the repealing act of 1913, but that, wholly independent of that act, and proceeding upon sound principle and abundant authority, the court arrived at the conclusion that the Act of 1907 was unconstitutional and void; and therefore it results that this case does not present any question for decision under the Federal Constitution, and that, for want of jurisdiction, the writ of error must be dismissed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Pitney dissent upon the ground that chapter 355 of the Laws of 1907 of the state of New York, creating the Long Sault Development Company and conferring upon it certain rights and franchises, when accepted, as it was, by the company, constituted a contract between the state and the company; that the repealing act and accompanying legislation passed in 1913 (chaps. 452 and 453) had the effect of impairing the obligation of that contract, in contravention of  10 of article 1 of the Federal Constitution; and that effect was given to the latter legislation by the decision under review. \n\n\n\n","115":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOOMIS v. LEHIGH VALLEY R CO(1916)\nNo. 106\nArgued: December 6, 1915Decided: January 24, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edward P. White and John Colmey for plaintiffs in error.[ Loomis v. Lehigh Valley R Co \n240 U.S. 43\n (1916) ]\n\n\n[240 U.S. 43, 45]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lyman M. Bass, Daniel J. Kenefick, and Thomas R. Wheeler for defendant in error.\n\n\n[240 U.S. 43, 46]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiffs in error have long been shippers of grain and produce over the line of defendant carrier from Victor and other stations in Western New York. From time to time during a period beginning in August, 1906, and ending \n\n[240 U.S. 43, 47]\n\u00a0\n May 6, 1908, they requested it to furnish at such places for their use one or more cars-about two hundred altogether-suitable for transporting in bulk, wheat, oats, rye, apples, cabbages, and potatoes. In response, it sent ordinary box and refrigerator cars inadequate for the required service until fitted with inside doors or transverse bulkheads. Prior to 1906, in like circumstances, the custom was for the railroad to supply lumber without charge and shippers constructed these temporary fittings. This practice was discontinued at the stations mentioned, and, during the period specified, it refused either to supply such material or cars completely prepared for carrying in bulk the enumerated articles. Plaintiffs were therefore compelled to construct inside doors or bulkheads in the cars which they loaded and delivered to defendant for transportation to points both within and beyond the state. The total cost of material used was $322.07,-it varied from 40 cents to $3.50 per car.\n Payment of the amount so expended was demanded by plaintiffs and refused. Without preliminary resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission, they then brought this action in a state court upon the theory that the carrier having failed to perform its common-law duty to furnish adequate cars, they were entitled to recover as damages their consequent outlay. Defendant denied liability, and further challenged the court's jurisdiction over claims incident to interstate shipments because: It was and remains an interstate carrier subject to the act to regulate commerce as amended and supplemented as well as the act of Congress passed February 19, 1903 [32 Stat. at L. 847, chap. 708, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8597], known as the Elkins act, etc.; it had filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission the tariffs under which such shipments were made; these tariffs fixed rates for transportation only, and did not provide for payments or allowances for grain doors, bulkheads, or lumber for \n\n[240 U.S. 43, 48]\n\u00a0\n constructing the same; the rates were reasonable and just and had not been held otherwise by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n The court of appeals held that the common law imposed upon the railroads the duty of furnishing cars equipped with inside doors or bulkheads for transporting grain or provisions in bulk, and unless local or Federal statutes had established different rules, plaintiffs were entitled to recover. Having considered the statutes, it concluded the local act created no bar to recovery on account of the intrastate shipments, but that Congress had assumed such control over interstate shipments as to deprive the state courts of power to consider claims arising out of them. 208 N. Y. 312, 101 N. E. 907. The judgment of the appellate division in favor of plaintiffs for total cost of material supplied by them was modified accordingly and the record and proceedings remitted to the supreme court, Ontario county. This writ of error was then sued out to obtain a review of the judgment of the court of appeals, being addressed to the supreme court because the record was in its possession. Shanks v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. \n239 U.S. 556\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 188.\n No serious dispute exists concerning the facts. The applicable duly- filed interstate rate schedules made no reference to allowances for grain doors or bulkheads, and the circumstances under which these were installed, together with their cost, are not controverted. Whether there was jurisdiction in the state court to pass upon the carrier's liability incident to the interstate traffic is the sole point demanding consideration.\n The effect of the act to regulate commerce, as supplemented and amended, upon the jurisdiction of courts, has been expounded in many cases heretofore decided.

Co. \n238 U.S. 456\n, 59 L. ed. 1406, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896.\n Speaking through Mr. Justice Lamar in Mitchell Coal & Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 230 U. S. supra, we said (p. 255): 'The courts have not been given jurisdiction to fix rates or practices in direct proceedings, nor can they do so collaterally during the progress of a lawsuit when the action is based on the claim that unreasonable allowances have been paid. If the decision of such questions was committed to different courts with different juries the results would not only vary in degree, but might often be opposite in character-to the destruction of the uniformity in rate and practice which was the cardinal object of the statute.'\n In the Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. supra, we further said (p. 419 ): 'The dominating purpose of the statute was to secure conformity to the prescribed standards through the examination and appreciation of the complex facts of transportation by the body created for that purpose; and, as this court has repeatedly held, it would be destructive of the system of regulation defined by the statute if the court, without the preliminary action of the Commission, were to undertake to pass upon the administrative questions which the statute has primarily confided to it.'\n And in Texas & P. R. Co. v. American Tie & Timber Co. 234 U. S. supra, the rule was thus stated (p. 146): 'It is equally clear that the controversy as to whether the lumber tariff included cross-ties was one primarily to be determined by the Commission in the exercise of its power concerning tariffs and the authority to regulate conferred upon it by the statute. Indeed, we think it is indisputable that that subject is directly controlled by the authorities which establish that, for the preservation of the uniformity which \n\n[240 U.S. 43, 50]\n\u00a0\n it was the purpose of the act to regulate commerce to secure, the courts may not as an original question exert authority over subjects which primarily come within the jurisdiction of the Commission.'\n An adequate consideration of the present controversy would require acquaintance with many intricate facts of transportation and a consequent appreciation of the practical effect of any attempt to define services covered by a carrier's published tariffs, or character of equipment which it must provide, or allowances which it may make to shippers for instrumentalities supplied and services rendered. In the last analysis the instant cause presents a problem which directly concerns rate-making and is peculiarly administrative. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 199, 220\n, 58 S. L. ed. 199, 576, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 291. And the preservation of uniformity and prevention of discrimination render essential some appropriate ruling by the Interstate Commerce Commission before it may be submitted to a court. See Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Puritan Coal Min. Co. 237 U. S. pp. 128, 129, 59 L. ed. 871, 872, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 484; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Clark Bros. Coal Min. Co. 238 U. S. pp. 469, 470, 59 L. ed. 1412, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896.\n If, in respect to interstate business, the courts of New York may determine, as original matters, rate-making problems, those in other states have like jurisdiction. The uncertainty and confusion which would necessarily result is manifest. Ample authority has been given the Commission, in circumstances like those here shown, to administer proper relief, and in connection therewith to approve some general rule of action. In so doing it would effectuate the great purpose for which the statute was enacted.\n On June 1, 1908, before this proceeding was begun, the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled: 'A carrier may not lawfully reimburse shippers for the expense incurred in attaching grain doors to box cars unless expressly so provided in its tariff.' (Conference Ruling No. 78.) In National Wholesale Lumber Dealers' Asso. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. 14 Inters. Com. Rep. 154, \n\n[240 U.S. 43, 51]\n\u00a0\n June 23, 1908, after much consideration, the Commission refused to order carriers either to furnish flat cars equipped in all respects for transporting lumber or grant allowances for cost incurred by shippers in connection therewith. In New York State Shippers' Protective Asso. v. New York C. & H. R. R. Co. 30 Inters. Com. Rep. 437 (1914), the regulations and practices of railroads in Western New York with respect to car fittings used in bulk transportation of grain and produce were challenged. The shippers claimed: 'It is the carrier's duty to supply cars at all seasons of the year, fully equipped for the safe transportation of grain, potatoes, and other produce in bulk without further fitting; or, that if a car be tendered the shipper which cannot safely be used for such commodities, in view of their nature or of the condition of the weather, it is the carrier's duty to furnish, or to pay for, all materials and labor necessary to render the car reasonably safe.' This was denied. The opinions in these causes strikingly indicate the complicated administrative problem involved.\n We find no error in the judgment below and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N R. CO. v. OHIO VALLEY TIE CO.(1916)\nNo. 66\nArgued: Decided: December 18, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. Helm Bruce and Henry L. Stone for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Edward W. Hines, John Bryce Baskin, and J. V. Norman for defendant in error. \n\n[242 U.S. 288, 289]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit brought by the defendant in error in 1911 against the railroad company to recover for injury to business and other damages alleged to have been caused by the railroad's acts. The most important feature at this stage is that the railroad maintained and collected a higher rate for crossties than it did for lumber when they were carried between states, although the State Commission required the same rate upon both for carriage within the state, and although, as the railroad knew, the Interstate Commerce Commission repeatedly had decided that the rates for crossties and lumber should be the same. It is alleged that these and the other acts complained of were done for the purpose of getting rid of the plaintiff as a competitive buyer, and, in that sense, maliciously. The plaintiff tried to meet the higher rate by directing delivery within the state of ties intended to go beyond, which attempt the defendant encountered by refusal to carry them except on its interstate tariff, and hampered the plaintiff by declining to let its cars leave its road, by deliveries at points requiring a haul by wagon, and so forth; and, in short, it may be assumed that the railroad did other acts to further the alleged end, not necessary to be stated here.\n Shortly before bringing this suit the plaintiff complained to the Interstate Commerce Commission in respect of charges collected upon ninety- one carloads of ties, and in 1912 obtained an order that the railroad pay to it $6,198 as reparation for unreasonable rates, and establish a rate for ties not to exceed its contemporaneous one for lumber of the same kind of wood. This order was pleaded by an amendment to the petition, and it appeared at the trial that the sum awarded had been paid. As the damage alleged was attributed mainly to the publication and exaction of excessive charges, the defendant insisted at \n\n[242 U.S. 288, 290]\n\u00a0\n the trial and before the court of appeals upon its rights under the Act to Regulate Commerce, and those rights were passed upon by the court, so that there is no doubt of the jurisdiction here, although some questions were raised that we think it unnecessary to discuss.\n The defendant contended and asked for a ruling that in this action no damages could be allowed 'on account of defendant's having charged to and collected from plaintiff unreasonable rates of freight for the carriage of interstate shipments of crossties' and other rulings to similar effect. It also asked an instruction that, under the Act to Regulate Commerce, it was required to collect the rates fixed by its tariff on file and in effect. These requests were refused, and the jury were told that if they believed that the rates found by the Interstate Commerce Commission to be unreasonable were wilfully and maliciously maintained with intent to injure the plaintiff's business, and that the defendant knew them to be unreasonable, and that by its acts it tied up a part of the plaintiff's capital, and so damaged the plaintiff's business, then upon this, as well as on several other possible findings stated, they would find for the plaintiff. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for certain itemized expenses and for $50,000 damage to plaintiff's business and credit, as mentioned in the above instruction. Judgment on the verdict was affirmed by the court of appeals. 161 Ky. 212, 170 S. W. 633.\n The court of appeals decided that the Act to Regulate Commerce committed to the Interstate Commerce Commission only the granting of special relief against the making of an overcharge, and that the satisfaction of the Commission's award still left open an action in the state courts to recover what are termed general damages,-such as are supposed to have been recovered in this case. In this we are of opinion that the court was wrong.\n By  8 a common carrier violating the commands of the act is made liable to the person injured thereby 'for the \n\n[242 U.S. 288, 291]\n\u00a0\n full amount of damages sustained in consequence' of the violation. [24 Stat. at L. 382, chap. 104, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8572.] By  9 any person so injured may make complaint to the Commission or may sue in a court of the United States to recover the damages for which the carrier is liable under the act, but must elect in each case which of the two methods of procedure he will adopt. The rule of damages in one hardly can be different from that proper for the other. An award directing the carrier to pay to the complainant the sum to which he is entitled is provided for by  16. By the same section, if the carrier dose not comply in due time with the order, the complainant may sue in a state court,-which implies that if the order has been complied with and the money paid no suit can be maintained. It is to be noticed further that reparation before answer is contemplated as possible by  13, and in that case the carrier shall be relieved of liability to the complainant, though only, of course, for the particular violation of law. The decisions say that whatever the damages were, they could be recovered (Pennsylvania R. Co. v. International Coal Min. Co. \n230 \nU.S. 184, 202\n, 203 S., 57 L. ed. 1446, 1453, 1454, 33 Sup. Ct.

Cas. 1916B, 691); and that the statute determines the extent of damages ( Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Clark Bros. Coal Min. Co. \n238 \nU.S. 456, 472\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1406, 1413, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896). We are of opinion that all damage that properly can be attributed to an overcharge, whether it be the keeping of the plaintiff out of its money, dwelt upon by the trial court, or the damage to its business following as a remoter result of the same cause, must be taken to have been considered in the award of the Commission and compensated when that award was paid.\n If, at a new trial, the plaintiff can prove that the defendant unjustifiably refused cars or caused it other damage not attributable to the overcharge of freight, our decision does not prevent a recovery; but it is evident that the present judgment embraces elements that cannot be allowed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N R.

O'Rear, J. M. Robsion, and B. G. Williams for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff's intestate was a fireman upon a switching engine which was moving upon a switch track. A caboose stood upon the main track so near to where the engine moved that the deceased struck it and was killed. His administrator brought this action against the railroad, the plaintiff in error, for causing the intestate's death, and got a verdict, which, it is admitted, cannot be sustained if the deceased was engaged in interstate commerce. The dealings of the state courts with that question are the ground for the present writ of error. The judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed by the court of appeals. 165 Ky. 658, 177 S. W. 465.\n The business upon which the deceased was engaged at the moment was transferring an empty car from one switch track to another. This car was not moving in interstate commerce, and that fact was treated as conclusive by the court of appeals. In this the court was in error, for if, as there was strong evidence to show, and as the court seemed to assume, this movement was simply for the purpose of reaching and moving an interstate car, the purpose would control and the business would be interstate. The difference is marked between a mere expectation that the act done would be followed by other work of a different character, as in Illinois C. R. Co. v. Behrens, \n233 \nU.S. 473, 478\n, 58 S.

The railroad company did not ask to go to the jury on the question whether the deceased was engaged in interstate commerce. It simply asked the court to direct a verdict, on the ground, among others, that it appeared as matter of law that he was so engaged. But if the question had been left to the jury, and they had disbelieved the testimony that the empty car was moved for the ulterior purpose of interstate commerce, there would have been no error of law in allowing a verdict for the plaintiff to stand. It is true that the judge seems to have assumed that the business in hand was intrastate, but the only objection indicated was to his not ruling the contrary; and, as the railroad did not ask to go to the jury, and the only ruling requested was properly denied, the judgment must stand.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N.

Sims for the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company.\n Messrs. George H. Lamar. D. W. Wright, C. U. McElroy, and B. F. Procter for Jeanette Stewart, administratrix.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action brought under the employers' liability act of April 22, 1908, chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657, against the railroad company for negligently causing the death of the plaintiff's intestate, her husband. There were two trials. A verdict and judgment for the plaintiff at the first were set aside by the court of appeals. 156 Ky. 550, 161 S. W. 557; 157 Ky. 642, 163 S. W. 755. A judgment for a less amount at the second trial was sustained. 163 Ky. 823, 174 S. W. 744. The railroad company seeks to overthrow the last judgment; the plaintiff, by her cross writ, seeks to reinstate the first; but, failing that, contends that the last should be affirmed; denying, that is, that there are any grounds for the railroad company's writ.\n The object of the plaintiff's writ of error was to go behind the second trial and reinstate state the first judgment. But the verdict was found upon an instruction that the jury should find, if anything, 'such a sum as will fairly compensate his estate for his death,'-given, it would seem, in forgetfulness that the case arose under the act of Congress. See 157 Ky. 642. This instruction was excepted to, and neither justice nor law would permit the verdict and judgment based upon it to be reinstated after the state court had set it aside. We therefore examine the arguments in 904 no farther, and do not cosider whether if, in our opinion, there had been no error of Federal law at the first trial, the plaintiff could have had the relief that she asks. Fairfax v. Hunter, 7 Cranch, \n\n[241 U.S. 261, 263]\n\u00a0\n 603, 628, 3 L. ed. 453, 461; Jones Nat. Bank v. Yates, \n240 \nU.S. 541, 563\n, 60 S. L. ed. -, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 429.\n The railroad company had for its principal object in bringing the case here to set up the 7th Amendment, and to deny jurisdiction in any state court where a verdict of nine or more out of the twelve men on the jury was allowed by the local law. The notion that a substantive right vesting under the law of one jurisdiction cannot be recognized and enforced in another, at least, as between the United States and a state, unless by procedure identical with that of the first, is disposed of in Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Bombolis [\n241 U.S. 211\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595].\n The first of the other objections is that the court of appeals was not authorized to add 10 per cent damages on the amount of the judgment, as it did. But the railroad company obtained a supersedeas, and the law of the state makes 10 per cent the cost of it to all persons if the judgment is affirmed. There was no obligation upon the state to provide for a suspension of the judgment, and nothing to prevent its making it costly in cases where ultimately the judgment is upheld. So, the state may allow interest upon a judgment from the time when it is rendered, if it provides appellate proceedings and the judgment is affirmed, as, but for such proceedings, interest would run as of course until the judgment was paid.\n The railroad company contends at some length that the case should have been taken from the jury by the direction of a verdict in its favor. As the opinion of both courts below and the jury were against it, and as we agree with their judgment, we shall not discuss this assignment of error at length. Great Northern R. Co. v. Knapp, \n240 \nU.S. 464, 466\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 399. The facts were these: Stewart, the deceased, was engineer on a north-bound freight train upon a single track, that had to go upon a siding to make way for a south-bound freight train. There were cars already on the siding which Stewart's train pushed ahead, and this \n\n[241 U.S. 261, 264]\n\u00a0\n train and the cars more than filled the siding. Therefore they pushed forward onto the main track to the rear of the south-bound train, and the latter went on its way. It still, however, was necessary to keep the main track clear for another south-bound train, and therefore Stewart's train began to back so as to free the main track north of the switch, which would be the first point reached by the expected train. While it was backing and approaching the southerly end of the switch, the rear brakeman suddenly applied the air brakes, and the sudden shock caused the engineer to strike his head against the cab, by reason of which he died. The conductor in charge of the movement testified that he intended not to cross the southerly point of the switch, and it could be found that the brakeman's act was a breach of duty, that it manifestly would cause a sudden shock, and that, although the particular position of, or specific damage to, Stewart, was unknown to the brakeman, generically it was the kind of thing that was likely to happen, and that he and his employers were liable for consequences of that sort. The jurt was instructed that Stewart assumed the risks incident to his employment, and that, if the application of the air brakes was made upon a reasonable belief that it was necessary to apply them in order to avoid injury to property, they should find for the defendant unless they found that the emergency was brought about by the defendant's servants in the negligent operation of the train before the brakes were applied. As an abstract proposition the qualification was correct, and the jury might have found that the conductor did not manage the train with due care, and so made the application necessary. Whatever might have been our opinion had we been in the jury's place, we do not feel warranted in saying that they had no evidence to go upon, or that the instructions were wrong.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N.

See 33 Inters. Com. Rep. 76, for the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The order complained of required the appellants, the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, the Nashville, Chattanooga, & St. Louis Railway, and the Louisville & Nashville Terminal Company to desist and abstain 'from maintaining a practice whereby they refuse to switch interstate competitive traffic to and from the tracks of the Tennessee Central Railroad Company at Nashville, Tennessee, on the same terms as interstate noncompetitive traffic, while interchanging both kinds of said traffic on the same terms with each other, as said practice is found by the Commission in its said report to be unjustly discriminatory.' It was further ordered: 'That the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, Nashville, Chattanooga, & St. Louis Railway, and Louisville & Nashville Terminal Company be, and they are hereby, notified and required to establish, on or before May 1, 1915, upon notice to the Interstate Commerce Commission and to the general public by not less than thirty days' filing and posting in the manner prescribed in  6 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, and thereafter to maintain and apply to the switching of interstate traffic to and from the \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 70]\n\u00a0\n tracks of the Tennessee Central Railroad Company at said Nashville, rates and charges which shall not be different than they contemporaneously maintain with respect to similar shipments to and from their respective tracks in said city, as said relation is found by the Commission in its said report to be nondiscriminatory.' The appellants contend as matter of law that the relations between them exclude any charge of discrimination that is based only upon a refusal to extend to the Tennessee Central road the advantages that they enjoy.\n The order is based upon discrimination and is limited by the duration of the interchange between the appellants found to be discriminatory, and the question argued by the appellants is the only question in the case. Therefore it is necessary to consider relations between the appealing railroads that were left on one side in Louisville & N. R. Co. v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1177, 1183, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 696.\n The Louisville & Nashville traverses Nashville from north to south, the Nashville & Chattanooga from west to southeast, the Tennessee Central from northwest to east. They all are competitors for Nashville traffic. In 1872, contemplating a possible Union Station, the Louisville & Nashville acquired trackage rights from the Nashville & Chattanooga that connected its northern and southern terminals in the city (previously separate), and the terminal of the Nashville & Chattanooga. It now owns 71 per cent of the stock of the latter. In 1893 these two roads caused the appellant Terminal Company to be organized under the general laws of Tennessee, with the right to let its property. The Louisville & Nashville owns all the stock of this company. In 1896 the two roads respectively let to the Terminal Company their several properties in the neighborhood of the original depot grounds of the Nashville & Chattanooga for 999 years, and shortly afterwards the Terminal made what is termed \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 71]\n\u00a0\n a lease of the same, and subsequently acquired property to the two roads jointly for a like term. It covenanted to construct all necessary passenger and freight buildings, tracks, and terminal facilities, the roads to pay annually as rental 4 per cent of the actual cost, and to keep the properties in repair. The Terminal Company then made a contract with the city for the construction of a Union Station, the two roads guarantying the performance, and the construction was completed in 1900; the tracks connecting with those of the two roads, but not with those of the Tennessee Central. The Terminal Company, as part of the improvements, purchased large additional properties, the two roads advancing the funds, and the company executing a mortgage for $3,000,000 guaranteed by the roads. $2,535,000 of the bonds were issued and the proceeds used to repay the roads.\n On August 15, 1900, the two roads, at that time being the only two roads entering Nashville, made the arrangement under which they since have operated. They made an unincorporated organization called the Nashville Terminals which was to maintain and operate the property let to the two roads jointly by the Nashville Terminal Company and also 8.10 miles of main track and 23.80 miles of side track contributed by the Louisville & Nashville, and 12.15 miles of main and 26.37 miles of side track contributed by the Nashville & Chattanooga. The agreement between the roads provided a board of control consisting of a superintendent and the general managers of the two roads, the superintendent having the immediate control and appointing under officers, etc. The total expense of maintenance and operation is apportioned monthly between the two roads on the basis of the total number of cars and locomotives handled for each. There is no switching charge to or from locations on tracks of the Nashville Terminals within the switching limits on freight from or to Nashville over either road. The Ten- \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 72]\n\u00a0\n nessee Central tracks now connect with those of the Nashville & Chattanooga at Shops Junction, in the western section of the city, within the switching limits, and with those of the Louisville & Nashville at Vine Hill, outside the switching limits, and just outside the city on the south.\n It should be added that in December, 1902, a further agreement was made purporting to modify the lease to the railroads jointly by excluding from it the property that came from them respectively, and remitting the roads to their several titles as they stood before the lease, subject only to the mortgage, with some other changes that need not be mentioned. This partial change from joint tenancy back to several titles does not affect the substantial equality of the contribution of the two roads, and the joint tenure of the considerable property purchased by the Terminal Company was left unchanged.\n Another matter that seems immaterial to the case before us is that, since the connection between the Tennessee Central and the appellant roads, the latter have interchanged noncompetitive traffic with the former, but the Louisville & Nashville has refused to switch competitive traffic and coal except at its local rates, and the Nashville & Chattanooga has refused to switch it at all. The switching of coal was dealt with by this court in Louisville & N. R. Co. v. United States, \n238 U.S. 1\n, 59 L. ed. 1177, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 696. But the case now before us is not concerned with the effect of the carriers having thrown the terminals open to many branches of traffic (\n238 U.S. 18\n). It arises only upon the question of the discrimination supposed to arise from the appellants' relations to each other, as we have explained,-a question grazed but not hit by the decision in 238 U. S. See p. 19.\n If the intent of the parties or purpose of the arrangement was material in a case like this, obviously there was none to discriminate against the Tennessee Central road. That \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 73]\n\u00a0\n road did not enter Nashville when the plan was formed, and the two appellants had a common interest, although competitors,-an interest that also was public and in which the city of Nashville shared. By  3 of the Act to Regulate Commerce as it now stands, the act 'shall not be construed as requiring any such common carrier to give the use of its tracks or terminal facilities to another carrier engaged in like business.' [24 Stat. at L. 380, chap. 104, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8565.] Therefore if either carrier owned and used this terminal alone, it could not be found to discriminate against the Tennessee Central by merely refusing to switch for it, that is, to move a car to or from a final or starting point from or to a point of interchange. We conceive that what is true of one owner would be equally true of two joint owners, and if we are right the question is narrowed to whether that is not, for all practical purposes, the position in which the appellants stand. They do still hold jointly a considerable portion of the terminals, purchased with their funds. They manage the terminals as a whole, and, in short, deal with them in the same way that they would if their title was joint in every part. Of course they do not own their respective original tracks jointly, and it is matter for appreciation that perhaps defies more precise argument whether the change back to a several tenure of those tracks changed the rights of the parties. We cannot see in this modification of the paper title any change material to the point in hand. Neither road is paid for the use of its tracks, but the severally owned and the jointly held are brought into a single whole by substantially equal contributions and are used by each as occasion requires.\n The fact principally relied upon to uphold the order of the Commission is that, instead of each road doing its own switching over the terminals used in common, they switch jointly; and it is said that therefore each is doing for the other a service that it cannot refuse to a third. We cannot believe that the rights to their own terminals, reserved by \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 74]\n\u00a0\n the law, are to be defeated by such a distinction. We take it that a several use by the roads for this purpose would open no door to a third road. If the title were strictly joint throughout in the two roads, we can see no ground for prejudice in the adoption of the more economical method of a single agency for both, each paying substantially as it would if it did its own work alone. But, as we have indicated, a large part of the terminals is joint property in substance, and the whole is held and used as one concern. What is done seems to us not reciprocal switching, but the use of a joint terminal in the natural and practical way. It is objected that, upon this view, a way is opened to get beyond the reach of the statute and the Commission. But the very meaning of a line in the law is that right and wrong touch each other, and that anyone may get as close to the line as he can if he keeps on the right side. And further, the distinction seems pretty plain between a bonafide joint ownership or arrangement so nearly approaching joint ownership as this, and the grant of facilities for the interchange of traffic that should be extended to others on equal terms. The joint outlay of the two roads has produced much more than a switching arrangement; it has produced a common and peculiar interest in the station and tracks even when the latter are not jointly owned. In our opinion the order was not warranted by the law; but, in overturning it upon the single point discussed, we do so without prejudice to the Commission's making orders to prevent the appellants from discriminating between competitive and noncompetitive goods, so long as they open their doors to the latter, the appellants being entitled to reasonable compensation, taking into account the expense of the terminal that they have built and paid for.\n Decree reversed. Injunction to issue, without prejudice to further orders by the Interstate Commerce Commission as stated in the opinion. \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 75]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney, with whom concurred Mr. Justice Day, Mr. Justice Brandeis, and Mr. Justice Clarke, dissenting:\n I am unable to concur in the opinion of the court, and, in view of the far-reaching effect of the decision upon the commercial interests of the country, deem it a duty to set forth the grounds of my dissent.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission found as matter of fact (33 Inters. Com. Rep. 76, 84): 'Defendants [the two railroad companies, now appellants] unquestionably interchange traffic with each other and without distinction between competitive and noncompetitive traffic. The cars of both roads are moved over the individually owned terminal tracks of the other to and from industries on the other, and both lines are rendered equally available to industries located exclusively on one. The movement, it is true, is not performed immediately by the road over whose terminal tracks it is performed, but neither is it performed immediately by the road whose cars are moved. It is performed by a joint agent for both roads, and that being so, we are of the opinion that the arrangement is essentially the same as a reciprocal switching arrangement, and accordingly constitutes a facility for the interchange of traffic between, and for receiving, forwarding, and delivering property to and from defendants' respective lines, within the meaning of the second paragraph of  3 of the act. [Interstate Commerce Act.] . . . We cannot agree with defendants' contention that they have merely exchanged trackage rights. But, even if they have, we think the term 'facility,' as used in  3 of the act, also includes reciprocal trackage rights over terminal tracks, the consequences and advantages to shippers being identical with those accruing from reciprocal switching arrangements.'\n The district court, three judges sitting (227 Fed. \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 76]\n\u00a0\n 258, 269), after careful consideration, reached the following conclusions: 'The operation jointly carried on by the Louisville & Nashville and the Nashville & Chattanooga under the Terminals agreement is not a mere exchange of trackage rights to and from industries on their respective lines at Nashville, under which each does all of its own switching at Nashville and neither switches for the other. It is, on the contrary, in substance and effect, an arrangement under which the entire switching service for each railroad over the joint and separately owned tracks is performed jointly by both, operating as principals through the Terminals as their joint agent, each railroad, as one of such joint principals, hence performing through such agency switching service for both itself and the other railroad. . . . And, viewed in its fundamental aspect, and considered with reference to its ultimate effect, we entirely concur in the conclusion of the Commission that such joint switching operation 'is essentially the same as a reciprocal switching arrangement,' constituting a facility for the interchange of traffic between the lines of the two railroads, within the meaning of the second paragraph of  3 of the Interstate Commerce Act. That each railroad does not separately switch fro the other, but that such switching operations are carried on jointly, is not, in our opinion, material. If it were, all reciprocal switching operations carried on by two railroads at any connecting point of several carriers could be easily put beyond the reach of the act, and its remedial purpose defeated, by the simple device of employing a joint agency to do such reciprocal switching. The controlling test of the statute, however, lies in the nature of the work done, rather than in the particular device employed or the names applied to those engaged in it.'\n With these views I agree. Elaborate argument is made in behalf of appellants in the effort to show that the method of operating the Nashville Terminals is not 'r- \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 77]\n\u00a0\n eciprocal switching' within a certain narrow definition of that term. This is an immaterial point; the real question being whether it constitutes a facility for the interchange of traffic between the respective lines of appellants, and for the receiving, forwarding, and delivering of property between connecting lines, within the meaning of  3 of the Interstate Commerce Act (chap. 104, 24 Stat. at L. 380, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8565), so that it must be rendered to the patrons of the Tennessee Central upon equal terms with those of the Louisville & Nashville and the Nashville & Chattanooga. I cannot doubt that it bears this character.\n The section reads as follows: 'Sec. 3. That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.\n'Every common carrier subject to the provisions of this act shall, according to their respective powers, afford all reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic between their respective lines, and for the receiving, forwarding, and delivering of passengers and property to and from their several lines and those connecting therewith, and shall not discriminate in their rates and charges between such connecting lines; but this shall not be construed as requiring any such common carrier to give the use of its tracks or terminal facilities to another carrier engaged in like business.'\n\n It is clear, I think, that in the second paragraph of this section the word 'facilities' is employed in two meanings. Where it first occurs, it means those acts or operations that facilitate or render easy the interchange of traffic; \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 78]\n\u00a0\n while, in the final clause, 'to give the use of its tracks or terminal facilities,' the words 'terminal facilities' are employed in a figurative sense and as equivalent to 'terminal properties.' This is obvious from the association together of tracks and terminal facilities as things subject to use. And the same words are used in the same sense in the 1906 amendment to  1 of the act (chap. 3591, 34 Stat. at L. 584, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563), by which the definition of the term 'railroad' was expanded so as to include 'all switches, spurs, tracks, and terminal facilities of every kind used or necessary in the transportation of the persons or property designated herein.'\n There is nothing in the order of the Commission now under review that requires appellants or either of them, or their agency, the Nashville Terminals, to give the use of tracks or terminal facilities to the Tennessee Central, either physically or in any other sense, within the meaning of the final clause of  3. It require them merely to interchange interstate competitive traffic to and from the tracks of the Tennessee Central on the same terms as interstate noncompetitive traffic, so long as they interchange both kinds of traffic with each other on the same terms; and also to establish and apply to the switching of interstate traffic to and from the Tennessee Central rates and charges not different from those that they contemporaneously maintain with respect to similar shipments as between themselves. Undoubtedly the expenditures made by appellants in the construction of the joint terminal property, so far as that property is used in interchange switching, is an element to be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of the switching charges. And the same is true with respect to the value of the separately owned tracks of appellants, so far as necessarily used in mutual interchanges.\n The practice of the Louisville & Nashville and the Nashville & Chattanooga in refusing to interchange competi- \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 79]\n\u00a0\n tive on the same terms as noncompetitive traffic with the Tennessee Central, while interchanging both kinds of traffic as between themselves, was found by the Commission to be unduly discriminatory, there being no substantial difference in the conditions of the interchange, nor any increased cost of interchanging competitive as compared with noncompetitive traffic.\n The tracks included in the joint terminal arrangement of appellants include 8.10 miles of main and 23.80 miles of side tracks separately owned by the Louisville & Nashville, 12.15 miles of main and 26.37 miles of side tracks separately owned by the Nashville & Chattanooga, and some yard tracks owned by the Louisville & Nashville Terminal Company, whose entire stock is owned by the Louisville & Nashville R. R. Company. It may be conceded that, by virtue of the lease from the Terminal Company to the appellant railroads, even as modified in December, 1902, there remains in some sense a joint tenure of the property of the Terminal Company. But, in my view, the question of the ownership of the property is entirely aside from the real point. The discrimination charged and found by the Commission is not so much in the use of terminal property as in the performance of interchange services; and for such discrimination a community of interest in the property affords neither justification nor excuse.\n So far as the nondiscriminatory performance of those services requires that cars from the Tennessee Central shall be admitted to the terminal tracks of the Louisville & Nashville and the Nashville & Chattanooga, and to tracks in which these companies have a joint interest, this is so only because appellants have, as between themselves, and also as regards traffic from the Tennessee Central, thrown their terminals open to the public use. The argument for appellants rests upon the essential fallacy that the terminal facilities are, in an absolute sense, and for all purposes, private property. But they, like all \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 80]\n\u00a0\n other parts of the railroad line, are, with respect to their use, devoted to the benefit of the public. And the final clause of  3, while it protects each carrier to a certain extent in the separate use of its terminal property, does so not otherwise than it protects its particular use of the main line of railroad. 'Tracks' are mentioned together with 'terminal facilities,' and the same rule is applied to both. The fact that a carrier owns its own terminals is no more an excuse for discriminatory treatment of its patrons with respect to services performed therein than its ownership of the main line is an excuse for discrimination with respect to transportation thereon.\n It is said that if either of the appellants were the sole owner of the terminal properties in question and used them alone, it could not be deemed to discriminate against the Tennessee Central because of a mere refusal to switch for it in the interchange of traffic. Of course, if it refused all connecting carriers alike, it could not be held for discrimination. But whether it would be at liberty to refuse to switch for the Tennessee Central would depend upon circumstances; for instance, upon whether the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to its authority under  15 of the act, as amended in 1910 (chap. 309, 36 Stat. at L. 552, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8583), should establish the two lines as a through route, or (without that) should determine upon adequate evidence that the refusal of switching privileges was a failure to affored reasonable and proper facilities for the interchange of traffic between the connecting lines under  3. Car interchange between connecting lines was made by the 1910 amendment of  1 of the act a positive duty on the part of the carrier, even without action by the Commission. 36 Stat. at L. 545, chap. 309, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563\n\n\n I deem it a most material fact that the appellants already interchange noncompetitive traffic with the Tennessee Central, upon terms like those upon which they interchange both competitive and noncompetitive traffic \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 81]\n\u00a0\n between themselves. So far as their method of doing this amounts to an interchange of trackage rights they have by their voluntary action thrown open the use of their terminals to all branches of traffic excepting so far as they discriminate against competitive traffic over the Tennessee Central. Not only so, but the Commission has expressly found (33 Inters,. Com. Rep. 82) that the Louisville & Nashville will switch competitive coal and other competitive traffic to and from the Tennessee Central, the interchange being usually effected at Shops Junction and over the rails of the Nashville & Chattanooga. But the Louisville & Nashville insists upon charging local rates as if for transportation between Nashville and Overton, Tennessee, which amount to from $12 to $36 per car, and are therefore in effect prohibitory. For a time the Nashville & Chattanooga in like manner offered to perform the same switching service to and from the Tennessee Central at its local rates, and published a terminal tariff December 14, 1913, expressly providing that such local rates would apply to competitive traffic from and destined to the Tennessee Central. This, however, was revoked shortly after the complaint in the present case was filed. There is here a very plain discrimination, found by the Commission to be an undue discrimination, not merely against the Tennessee Central, but against a 'particular description of traffic,' which is distinctly prohibited by  3. The conduct of appellants is quite analogous to the making of a discrimination in the charge for carriage, not because of any difference inhering in the goods or in the cost of the service rendered in transporting them, but upon the mere basis of the ownership of the goods,- a discrimination condemned by this court in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. \n220 \nU.S. 235, 252\n, 55 S. L. ed. 448, 456, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 392.\n The present system of interchanging traffic between appellants was established in August, 1900, a year or two before the line of the Tennessee Central was constructed \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 82]\n\u00a0\n into Nashville. Emphasis was laid upon this, in argument, as refuting the suggestion that the arrangement could be deemed a 'device' to avoid the discrimination clause of  3 of the Interstate Commerce Act. The findings of the Commission show, however (33 Inters. Com. Rep. 81), that when the Tennessee Central entered Nashville it was only after strong opposition from the Louisville & Nashville; and (p. 79) that, prior to the year 1898, the people of Nashville had become desirous of better terminal facilities, particularly of a union passenger depot, and an ordinance authorizing a contract to that end between the city and the Terminal Company was proposed, containing a proviso that the terminal facilities should also be available on an equitable basis to railroads which might be built in the future. The present appellants opposed this proviso and an ordinance omitting it was passed, but was vetoed by the mayor on account of the omission. It clearly enough appears, therefore, that the agreement of August, 1900, was made by appellants in view of the probability of some other road entering Nashville thereafter.\n But were it otherwise, the result should be the same. The obligation to avoid discrmination and to afford 'all reasonable, proper, and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic' is not qualified by any rights of priority. The new road is a servant of the public, equally with the others; subject to the same duty and entitled, for its patrons, to demand reasonable and impartial performance of the reciprocal duty from carriers that preceded it in the field.\n In my opinion the present case is controlled by our decisions in the former case between the same parties (Louisville & N. R. Co. v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 19 S., 59 L. ed. 1177, 1183, 1184, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 696), and the earlier case of Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, \n236 U.S. 351\n, 366 et seq., 59 L. ed. 616, 625, P.U.R.1915B, 261, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 370. In these cases many of the same arguments that are here advanced were considered and overruled by the court. The latter case concerned the \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 83]\n\u00a0\n switching of interstate carload traffic between industrial tracks and junction points within the switching limits at New Castle, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Company undertook to sustain a practice of doing such switching at $2 per car for three railroads while refusing to do it for the Buffalo, Rochester, & Pittsburgh, upon the ground of its sole ownership of the terminals and the fact that the three other carriers were in a position, either at New Castle or elsewhere, to offer it reciprocal advantages fully compensatory for the switching done for them in New Castle, whereas the Buffalo, Rochester, & Pittsburgh was not in a position to offer similar advantages. The Interstate Commerce Commission (29 Inters. Com. Rep. 114) overruled this contention, and in this was sustained by the district court (214 Fed. 445), and by this court. We there held (\n236 U.S. 361\n) that the question what was an undue or unreasonable preference or advantage under  3 of the Interstate Commerce Act was a question not of law, but of fact; and that if the order of the Commission did not exceed its constitutional and statutory authority and was not unsupported by testimony, it could not be set aside by the courts; held (p. 363), that the provisions of  3, although that section remains unchanged, must be read in connection with the amendments of 1906 and 1910 to other parts of the act, and that by these amendments the facilities for delivering freight at terminals were brought within the definition of transportation to be regulated; and also (pp. 368, 369) that the order did not amount to a compulsory taking of the use of the Pennsylvania tracks by another road within the inhibition of the final clause of  3; no right being given to the Buffalo road to run its cars over the terminals of the Pennsylvania Company, or to use or occupy its stations or depots for purposes of its own.\n In the former case between the present parties (Louisville & N. R. Co. v. United States, \n238 U.S. 1\n, 59 L. ed. 1177, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 696), we sustained \n\n[242 U.S. 60, 84]\n\u00a0\n the district court (216 Fed. 672) in refusing an injunction to restrain the putting into effect of an order of the Commission (28 Inters. Com. Rep. 533, 540) requiring appellants to interswitch interstate coal with the Tennessee Central as they did with each other. The findings of the Commission (p. 542) recognized that the terminals were in part jointly owned and in part the separate property of the two appellants. The district court (216 Fed. 682, 684) alluded to this fact. And this court ( \n238 U.S. 17\n-20) did not ignore that fact, but laid it aside as immaterial, declaring: 'If the carrier, however, does not rest behind that staturory shield [the final clause of  3], but chooses voluntarily to throw the terminals open to many branches of traffic, it to that extent makes the yard public. Having made the yard a facility for many purposes and to many patrons, such railroad facility is within the provisions of  3 of the statute, which prohibits the facility from being used in such manner as to discriminate against patrons and commodities.'\n If the decision reached in the present case is adhered to, and remains uncorrected by remedial legislation, it will open a wide door to discriminatory practices repugnant alike to the letter and the spirit of the Act to Regulate Commerce.\n Mr. Justice Day, Mr. Justice Brandeis, and Mr. Justice Clarke concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOVATO v. NEW MEXICO(1916)\nNo. 123\nArgued: Decided: December 11, 1916\n\n\n\n Mr. T. B. Catron for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Frank W. Clancy, Attorney General of New Mexico, for defendant in error. \n\n[242 U.S. 199, 200]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n In the district court of the territory of New Mexico the accused, on May 9th, 1910, pleaded not guilty to an indictment for murder. On May 24, 1911, without withdrawing his plea, he demurred to the indictment on the ground that it charged no offense. The demurrer was overruled, and, both parties announcing themselves ready for trial, a jury was impaneled and sworn and the witnesses for both sides were called and sworn. The record then states: 'That thereupon it appearing to E. C. Abbott, Esq., district attorney, that defendant had not been arraigned and had not plead since the overruling of defendant's demurrer, upon motion the court dismissed the jury and directed that the defendant be arraigned and plead.' The accused was accordingly again at once arraigned and pleaded not guilty, and, both sides again announcing themselves ready for trial, the same jury previously impaneled was sworn and the trial proceeded. At the close of the evidence for the prosecution the defendant moved for a directed verdict on the ground, among others, that the record showed that he had been formerly placed in jeopardy for the same offense, since it appeared that in the same case a jury had been impaneled and sworn and thereafter had been dismissed from a consideration of the case. The motion was denied and a conviction of manslaughter followed. The same ground was relied upon in a motion in arrest of judgment which was denied, and from the judgment and sentence subsequently entered an appeal was prosecuted to the supreme court of the territory.\n Pending the appeal New Mexico was admitted to the Union and the case was heard by the supreme court of the state. In that court, in addition to the contention as to former jeopardy, the accused urged that he had been \n\n[242 U.S. 199, 201]\n\u00a0\n denied due process of law and had been deprived of the right to a trial by jury because from the record it appeared that although a jury was impaneled before he was arraigned and pleaded not guilty, that jury was dismissed and it did not appear that any jury was impaneled after his arraignment and plea. The court held this contention to be without merit and concluded from a consideration of the commonlaw doctrine of former jeopardy, in the light of which it deemed the constitutional provision on the subject was to be construed, that the question concerning it was raised too late, since it was first presented to the trial court after the conclusion of the state's case. To the judgment of affirmance giving effect to these conclusions this writ of error was prosecuted. 17 N. M. 666, L.R.A. 1917A, 1226, 134 Pac. 222.\n As the case was tried in a territorial court, the denial of asserted rights based upon the 5th and 6th Amendments presents questions within our jurisdiction.\n Without expressing any opinion as to the correctness of the ruling of the court below concerning the failure to promptly raise the question of former jeopardy, although on this record it may be conceded it presents a Federal question, we pass from its consideration, since we think the contention that the accused was twice put in jeopardy is wholly without merit. Under the circumstances there was, in the best possible view for the accused, a mere irregularity of procedure which deprived him of no right. Indeed, when it is borne in mind that the situation upon which the court acted resulted from entertaining a demurrer to the indictment after a plea of not guilty had been entered and not withdrawn, it is apparent that the confusion was brought about by an overcautious purpose on the part of the court to protect the rights of the accused. Whether or not, under the circumstances, it was a necessary formality to dismiss the jury in order to enable the accused to be again arraigned and plead, the action taken was clearly within the bounds of sound judicial discretion. \n\n[242 U.S. 199, 202]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580, 6 L. ed. 165, 166; Dreyer v. Illinois, \n187 \nU.S. 71, 85\n, 86 S., 47 L. ed. 79, 86, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 28, 15 Am. Crim. Rep. 253. See United States v. Riley, 5 Blatchf. 204, Fed. Cas. No. 16,164, in which the facts were in substance identical with those here presented.\n As to the contention concerning the denial of due process and the right to jury trial, it is not disputed that in the first instance a jury was legally impaneled. The argument is, however, that constitutional rights of the accused were violated because, after the order of dismissal and the plea of not guilty, there was a failure to impanel a jury, although the same jury previously drawn was at once sworn and tried the case. But we think the absolute want of merit in the proposition is manifest from its mere statement, and is additionally demonstrated by what we have previously siad.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","121":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLUSK v. BOTKIN(1916)\nNo. 451\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. R. R. Vermilion and W. F. Evans for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. James P. Coleman, W. P. Montgomery, John L. Hunt, and Mr. S. M. Brewster, Attorney General of Kansas, for defendant in error.\n Mr. Paul E. Walker, as amicus curiae, on behalf of the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company. \n\n[240 U.S. 236, 237]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiffs in error, the receivers of a railroad corporation organized under the laws of the state of Missouri, brought this action to recover the sum of $2,500, alleged to have been paid under protest to the secretary of state of the state of Kansas as a tax upon foreign corporations imposed by chapter 135 of the Laws of 1913. A general demurrer to the petition was sustained, and, as the plaintiff declined to plead further, judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant. This judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 95 Kan. 271, 147 Pac. 794.\n The act above mentioned ( 2) requires 'every foreign corporation, for profit, now or hereafter doing business in this state, and owning or using a part or all of its capital in this state, and subject to compliance with the laws relating to the admission of foreign corporations to do business in Kansas' to make annual report, setting forth certain facts, to the secretary of state. It is further provided that 'upon the filing of such report the secretary of state, from the facts thus reported and any other facts coming to his knowledge bearing upon the question, shall determine the proportion of the issued capital stock of the company represented by its property and business in Kansas, and shall charge and collect from such company, in addition to the initial fees, for the priviledge of exercising its franchise in Kansas, an annual fee upon that proportion of such foreign corporation's issued capital stock as is devoted to its Kansas business.' The amount of the fee is graduated according to the amount of the issued capital stock 'used in Kansas.' The minimum annual fee is $10, when the issued capital stock so used does not exceed $10,000; and the maximum annual fee is $2,500, when the issued capital stock so used exceeds $5,000,000. \n\n[240 U.S. 236, 238]\n\u00a0\n Construing these provisions of the act, and answering the objection that, as to a railroad company, and other foreign corporations, doing both a local and interstate business, the act was invalid because it undertook to regulate interstate commerce, the supreme court of Kansas said in State ex rel. Dawson v. Sessions, 95 Kan. 272, 275, 147 Pac. 789:\n'The requirements of the statute are imposed on such foreign corporations doing business in this state as are 'subject to compliance with the laws relating to the admission of foreign corporations to do business in Kansas.' ( 2.) Corporations which are engaged solely in interstate commerce are therefore wholly exempt from all its provisions, and those which do both an interstate and an intrastate business are exempt so far as concerns the former. The phrases 'that proportion of such foreign corporation's issued capital stock as is devoted to its Kansas business' ( 2), and 'the issued capital stock used in Kansas,' refer to the amount of capital invested in doing a purely local business. The total capital of the company is involved only as a basis for arriving at a reasonable estimate of the capital devoted to transportation originating and ending in Kansas.'\n\n In the instant case, the objections to the tax upon the foreign corporation rest entirely upon the asserted invalidity of the tax imposed by the same statute upon domestic corporations; it is insisted that the foreign corporation had complied with statutory conditions entitling it to be treated not less favorably, and that, if the tax laid by the statute upon domestic corporations is invalid, the tax laid upon the foreign corporation cannot be sustained. Apparently, no other contention was presented to the supreme court of the state (95 Kan. 271). And, accordingly, in the brief of the plaintiffs in error in this court, the questions involved are stated to be: (a) that the act under which the tax was demanded is unconstitutional because 'when applied to railroad \n\n[240 U.S. 236, 239]\n\u00a0\n companies organized under the laws of the state of Kansas,' owning lines extending into other states, the act places a burden upon interstate commerce and undertakes to tax property outside the state; (b) that the act seeks 'to place a tax upon the entire capital stock of domestic corporations owning and operating railroads in Kansas and other states,' that it thereby attempts to tax property outside the state, in contravention of the 14th Amendment, and that it 'is therefore void as to domestic corporations;' and (c) that the compliance by the Missouri corporation (of which the plaintiffs in error are receivers) with the terms of chapter 186 of the Laws of 1887, of Kansas, 'constituted a contract between the railroad company and the state, by which the state bound itself not to subject the railroad company or the plaintiffs in error to any greater liabilities than those imposed upon railroad corporations organized under the laws of Kansas, and conferred upon such foreign corporation complying with said act 'all the rights, privileges, and franchises' of Kansas railroad corporations;' and that it follows that, if the tax act is unconstitutional as to domestic corporations, the imposition of the tax in question upon the Missouri corporation 'would violate the obligations of the contract' and would deny to it 'the equal protection of the laws.'\n In the case of Kansas City, Ft. S. & M. R. Co. v. Botkin, decided this day [\n240 U.S. 227\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261], we have considered the arguments against the tax imposed by the statute upon domestic corporations, and we have found the objections to be untenable. Thus, the sole basis for the attack made by the plaintiffs in error upon the statute fails, and the judgment must be affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMALE v.

There is a motion to dismiss on the ground that 'the questions involved upon this appeal are moot questions \n\n[240 U.S. 97, 99]\n\u00a0\n . . . for the reason that, subsequent to the dismissal of the bill herein by the lower court, the appellant, as plaintiff, instituted in the supreme court of the state of New York, county of New York, an action upon the same alleged cause of action against the same defendants, and that such action in the supreme court of the state on New York was heard and determined, and that a final judgment upon the merits therein was rendered, dismissing the complaint filed in said action as against this appellee.' But as our power to review is limited to the question of jurisdiction alone, and as the ground of the motion obviously involves the defense of 'the thing adjudged,' going to the merits, the motion to dismiss is overruled, and we come to consider the question of the jurisdiction of the court below; that is, whether, as a Federal court, it had power to entertain the cause.

Philadelphia & R. R. Co. \n233 U.S. 352\n, 58 L. ed. 996, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 591.\n The bill alleged that the complainant, Male, who sued as the trustee of Gilbert W. Chapin, was a citizen of the state of New York and an inhabitant and resident of the southern district thereof. The defendants were the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company, a corporation created by an act of Congress, the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railroad Company, a corporation organized under an act of the legislature of the territory of Kansas, the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Kansas, and the Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Massachusetts. We do not stop to summarize the averments of the bill in order to make clear the nature of the relief sought because we accept as adequate for the purpose of the question before us the statement made on that subject in the printed argument filed on behalf of \n\n[240 U.S. 97, 100]\n\u00a0\n the appellant as follows: 'The relief prayed for is judgment for $120,000 and interest upon certain income bonds issued by the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company on the 1st day of October, 1880, and maturing October 1st, 1910, and for an adjudication that the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway Company (the present appellee) is liable in equity for the amount of such judgment by reason of the matters set forth in the bill of complaint.' As further stated in the argument for the appellant, the bill alleged that the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company 'is practically out of existence, and has not been nor can it be, served with process,' and that the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railroad Company and the Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Company were not served with process, and are not deemed to be necessary parties to the cause, and may be put out of view. The Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway Company, the only other defendant ( the appellee) was served through one of its officers in the city of New York. It thereupon appeared specially and 'for the single and sole purpose of making a motion to set aside the service of the subpoena and dismiss the bill of complaint as to it for want of jurisdiction over the person of said defendant.' And subsequently it moved to dismiss on two grounds: 1. That as its residence was in Kansas, it could not be sued outside of the district of which it was a resident without its consent; and that as Male, the complainant, was only colorably joined as a complainant, the real party being Chapin, for whom Male assumed to act as trustee, and who was a citizen and resident of Connecticut, there was no jurisdiction over the cause, as the suit was brought in the district of the residence of neither of the real parties; and, 2, that as the complainant sought to enforce a liability on the bonds of the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company, a corporation created by an act of Congress, involving an inherently Federal question, there was no jurisdiction in the court over the \n\n[240 U.S. 97, 101]\n\u00a0\n defendant, because, under such circumstances, it was entitled to be sued in the court of the district of its residence, and could not without its consent be impleaded in the district of the residence of the plaintiff, even if Male was treated as the real plaintiff, and entitled otherwise to sue in the southern district of New York. As stated in the certificate of the court below, the judgment of dismissal for want of jurisdiction was based upon both of the grounds; that is, the want of authority to sue in the southern district of New York because that was the district of the residence of neither of the parties, and because, owing to the Federal question, the defendant was entitled to be sued in the district of its residence.\n It is not disputable that, in so far as the contentions as to jurisdiction depended alone upon the right to sue because of the district in which the parties resided, they did not present questions of inherent Federal jurisdiction. We say this because controversies as to such subjects concern a personal privilege susceptible of being waived, which would not be the case if they involved contentions which were intrinsically and necessarily Federal.

Rep. 720. But while this is the case, it is yet also true that questions of jurisdiction depending upon controversies as to the district of residence, where the statutory rights in that regard have not been waived, when decided below, are questions of Federal jurisdiction, susceptible of being brought here by direct appeal under the provisions of  238 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, Comp.

Ct. Rep. 44.\n Our power to review thus being settled, the only question is, Did the court err in holding that, as a Federal court, within the meaning of the statute, it had no authority under the circumstances to entertain the cause? In \n\n[240 U.S. 97, 102]\n\u00a0\n solving this issue, without expressing any opinion as to the want of jurisdiction based upon the contention that Male, the complainant, had no real, but only a colorable and fictitious, interest, and hence that the suit was brought neither in the district of the residence of the complainant, nor that of the defendant, and confining our attention to the ruling that there was a want of power to entertain the cause in any other than the district of the residence of the defendant, because of the inherently Federal question presented, we think that the refusal to take jurisdiction was clearly right and should be affirmed. Undoubtedly the asserted right to a judgment on the bonds of the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company, a corporation created by an act of Congress, involved an inherently Federal question. Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 6 L. ed. 204; Washington & I. R. Co. v. Coeur d'Alene R. & Nav. Co. \n160 U.S. 77\n, 40 L. ed. 346, 10 Sup. Ct.

The work not having been finished on time, $7,320 of the agreed compensation was withheld as liquidated damages, and $210.50 as additional costs of superintendence and inspection, $7,530.50 in all, for which sum this suit is brought.\n The petition alleges that after getting through Core creek to and through the headwaters of Adams creek to a point on tide water about 5 miles from its mouth, where for a mile and a half it averages more than 1, 200 feet wide, and for the next 3 miles and a half 2,500 feet, the stumps and roots of a submerged forest were encountered at about 8 feet below the bottom of the water, which made it impossible to do the work with the ordinary machinery and in the ordinary way, or to finish the work by the time agreed. It is alleged that the forest was submerged by some abnormal force and violence of the elements, and that it could not have been discovered by the ordinary methods of inspection, and was not discovered in fact, although the claimant and others and the government had exercised every known precaution, and had made exhaustive examinations with the utmost care and skill. The petition sets up that this was a prevention 'by abnormal force and violence of the elements' within \n\n[241 U.S. 184, 187]\n\u00a0\n the contract, and and that the claimant also was entitled to an allowance of time under a clause in the specifications stating that the time is considered sufficient 'unless extraordinary and unforeseeable conditions supervene.' It also sets up that an extension of time was recommended by Captain Brown, although disallowed by the Chief Engineer. Finally the petition alleges that it was known by the government officials when the contract was made that the portion of the canal excavated by the claimant could not be used to any practical extent for commercial purposes until adjoining portions of a proposed line were completed, and that the additional work was not provided for or seriously contemplated within the time of the claimant's work. It is concluded that although the contract purports to provide for liquidated damages, fixed at $20 a day, yet, in the circumstances, it really imposed a penalty, and that the government has no right to retain the sum.\n As has been implied already, the contract agreed 'that time shall be considered as an essential feature of this contract, and that in case of the failure upon the part of the party of the second part to complete this contract within the time as specified and agreed upon that the party of the first part will be damaged thereby, and the amount of said damages being difficult, if not impossible of definite ascertainment and proof, it is hereby agreed that the amount of said damages shall be estimated, agreed upon, liquidated, and fixed in advance, and they are hereby agreed upon, liquidated, and fixed at the sum of twenty (20) dollars for each division for each and every day the party of the second part shall delay in the completion of this contract,' and the claimant agrees to pay that amount 'as liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty.' It is agreed further that the United States shall have the right to recover all costs of inspection and superintendence incurred by it during the period of delay, and that it may \n\n[241 U.S. 184, 188]\n\u00a0\n retain all the above-mentioned sums from any moneys falling due under the contract.\n There is a proviso that if the claimants 'shall by strikes, epidemics, local or state quarantine restrictions, or by the abnormal force or violence of the elements, be actually prevented from completing the work . . . at the time agreed upon' without contributory negligence on his part, 'such additional time may, with the prior sanction of the Chief of Engineers, be allowed him' . . . 'as, in the judgment of the party of the first part, or his successor, shall be just and reasonable.' As we have intimated, the specifications also state that the time allowed is considered sufficient 'unless extraordinary and unforeseeable conditions supervene.' The claimant further thinks that he finds some support for his argument in a provision that 'solid rock, large boulders, and compact gravel will not have to be removed at the prices bid for ordinary excavation. If such materials should be encountered, their removal, if required by the engineer, will be done under special agreement and paid for as extra work.' On the other hand, the claimant was required to remove all trees, and 'the channel must be cleared of all snags, logs, roots, stumps, or wreckage that project into or encroach in any way upon the cross section, . . . the cost of same being included in the unit price bid for excavation.' The claimant invokes a provision that the engineer's decision as to quality, quantity, and interpretation of the specifications shall be final; and this ends the statement of his case.\n It is hopeless to argue against the provisions that we have recited, and the further express warning that each bidder 'is expected to examine and decide for himself, as no allowance will be made should any of it prove to be otherwise than as stated,' except as above recited with regard to solid rock, etc. It is suggested that the special agreement to be made for the removal of 'such materials' \n\n[241 U.S. 184, 189]\n\u00a0\n means materials of similar kind; but the phrase cannot be stretched to cover roots. The statement in the specifications that the time is sufficient unless extraordinary conditions supervene does not promise an extension if such conditions do supervene. The extent of this promise is found in the words of the contract providing for the allowance of such additional time as, with the sanction of the Chief Engineer, the engineer in charge may think reasonable. Those words tend also to support the contention of the government that 'supervene' means come into being in the course of the work, as in the case of strikes, epidemics, etc., and not merely be discovered to have existed and still to exist. We may add that the averment hazarded that the submergence of the forest was due to abnormal force of the elements is too obvious an attempt to pervert the meaning of the proviso as to being actually prevented by such force from completing the work, to require analysis. But it is enough to say that any extension depended on the sanction of the Chief of Engineers, and that that sanction was denied. It is said that the engineer in charge construed the contract differently, as he recommended an allowance of time. But the ground of the recommendation does not appear to have been an incorrect interpretation of the contract; on the contrary, it is alleged that the liquidated damages were withheld by Captain Brown; and if his interpretation had been wrong, it is hard to see how it would have bound his superior on whose sanction the recommendation depended for effect. The suggestion that it was the duty of the Chief Engineer to give his sanction in the absence of fraud finds no support in the words used. The claimant must abide by the words. Carnegie Steel Co. v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 156, 164\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 342.\n The allegations by which the claimant attempts to avoid his contract making time of the essence, that the damages were difficult cult to prove, and that therefore they should be fixed at $20 a day, are too specula- \n\n[241 U.S. 184, 190]\n\u00a0\n tive to do more than emphasize the necessity for the liquidation. There is no element of deception or exorbitance, and although the case seems a hard one, we see no ground upon which the claimant can escape from the terms to which he has agreed. United States v. Bethlehem Steel Co. \n205 \nU.S. 105, 119\n, 51 S. L. ed. 731, 736, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 450.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCFARLAND v. AMERICAN SUGAR REFINING CO.(1916)\nNo. 847\nArgued: Decided: April 24, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 79, 80]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Donelson Caffery, Harry Gamble, Daniel Wendling, and Mr. Ruffin G. Pleasant, Attorney General of Louisiana, for appellants.\n Messrs. James M. Beck, Joseph W. Carroll, George Denegre, Hugh C. Cage, and Frank L. Crawford for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill in equity brought by a New Jersey corporation, the appellee, against the inspector of sugar refining, the governor, and the attorney general of Louisiana, to prevent the enforcement of act No. 10 of the extra session of the general assembly of that state for 1915. The grounds of relief are the commerce clause and the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n The plaintiff was granted a preliminary injunction by three judges in the district court, and the defendants appealed. 229 Fed. 284.\n A summary of the statute is as follows: The business of refining sugar is declared to be impressed with a public interest 'by reason of the nature and by reason of the monopolization thereof,' and on that footing the regulations are made. After providing for elaborate reports and inspection of books by the inspector, the act imposes for the benefit of the inspection fund a tax of 1\/2 cent for every 350 pounds of granu- \n\n[241 U.S. 79, 81]\n\u00a0\n lated sugar made. It then makes it unlawful to buy sugar on an ex parte test of quality, etc., and proceeds to authorize the inspector to make such reasonable regulations not only concerning that, but affecting any branch of the business of sugar refining, as he may deem proper and as may be conducive to the public interest, and to the prevention of monopoly in the business, or to the protection of the public from its consequences. Then come the provisions chiefly in issue here. By  7 'any person engaged in the business of refining sugar within this state who shall systematically pay in Louisiana a less price for sugar than he pays in any other state shall be prima facie presumed to be a party to a monopoly or combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce, and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a fine of $500 a day for the period during which he is adjudged to have done so;' his license to do business in the state is to be revoked, and any foreign corporation (such as the plaintiff is) is to be ousted from the state and its property sold. If irreparable injury to the public interest is shown in such a case, the court may appoint a receiver at any stage of the proceedings, etc. By  8, if shown by affidavit or otherwise, either in limine or after trial, that any refinery has been closed or kept idle for more than one year, it shall be presumed to have been done for the purpose of violating this act or the laws against monopoly, etc., and if the counter evidence does not rebut the presumption, the court shall order the owner to sell the refinery within six months, and, if that is not done, shall appoint a receiver to do it within twelve months. In computing the year of idleness any plant shall be treated as idle that has not been operating bona fide. By  9 in suits for ouster, etc., upon showing by the state that the monopoly, etc., are detrimental to the public welfare, an injunction may be issued or a receiver appointed, after a hearing, subject to an appeal return- \n\n[241 U.S. 79, 82]\n\u00a0\n able within five days, to be determined within forty days, etc. By  10 a fine of from $50 to $2,500 a day is imposed for violations of the act not otherwise provided for, or of any of the regulations promulgated by the inspector. By  11, in suits under the act, books, letters, and other documents, 'or apparent copies thereof,' of the defendant, shall be given effect as being what they purport to be and 'as establishing the facts carried on their face' unless sufficiently rebutted, upon proof of their having been in the possession or control of the defendant; and any report of any legislative committee of the state, or of the Senate or House of Representatives of the United States, or of any bureau, department, or commission acting under the authority either of the state or of the Senate or the House of Representatives of the United States, and the records of any court of any state, or of the United States, are made prima facie evidence of the facts set forth therein, subject to rebuttal. In conclusion, by  15 the business of refining sugar is defined to be 'that of any concern that buys and refines raw or other sugar exclusively, or that refines raw or other sugar from sugar taken on toll, or that buys or refines more raw or other sugar than the aggregate of the sugar produced by it from cane grown and purchased by it.'\n Besides the allegations that bring the plaintiff within the purview of the act, the claims of the protection of the Constitution, and the invocation of the principle of Ex parte Young, 209, U. S. 123, 52 L. ed. 714, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441, 14 Ann. Cas. 764, for equitable relief, the bill sets forth some facts that throw special light upon the case. First, for the bearing of  8, it shows that formerly the plaintiff purchased a consolidated refinery called the Louisiana Refinery, increased its capacity to 2,500,000 pounds daily, and worked it until 1909. It then built at a cost of about six million dollars a new refinery at Chalmette, with a daily melting capacity of 3,000,000 pounds, since increased to 3,500,000. It then closed the Louisiana \n\n[241 U.S. 79, 83]\n\u00a0\n Refinery, as it could not distribute from New Orleans more refined sugar than could be made at Chalmette. The machinery of the Louisiana Refinery is comparatively antiquated and could not be operated economically, although, in case of the destruction of the Chalmette plant, it could be used as a substitute at considerable expense and after some delay.\n As to the presumption created from the systematic paying in Louisiana a less price for sugar than is paid in any other state, the bill alleges that the plaintiff purchases on an average less than one half of the Louisiana sugar crop, of which half over a third is shipped as bought, to the plaintiff's northern refineries, so that not much over 30 per cent is melted at Chalmette. In fact, only a comparatively small portion of the plaintiff's meltings in Louisiana is of sugar produced in Louisiana, the remainder having been imported. The chief port for the receipt of raw sugar imported is New York, at or near which there are seven large refineries now in operation. The Louisiana sugar customarily has been brought on the market in November and December, during which months it is pressed for sale in amounts far in excess of the requirements of all the refineries in the state. Purchasers therefore had either to ship a part north, or to store it, with consequent loss from deterioriation and in weight, interest, and cost of storage and insurance, and at the risk of a decline in the market. These elements necessarily affect the price, which cannot be higher than that in the ultimate market, less the cost of transportation, and which has been approximately that. Furthermore, the period of storage is a time when the market for raw sugar generally declines, and the price of refined sugar follows that of raw, to the refiner's loss.\n Formerly a large part of the sugar manufactured in Louisiana by the plaintiff was sold in the Middle West and in Minnesota, Iowa, the Dakotas, etc., and it was to meet \n\n[241 U.S. 79, 84]\n\u00a0\n that market that the Chalmette refinery was built. But the great and rapid increase in the production of beet sugar, which now forms one sixth of all the sugar consumed in the United States and is sold at prices below those of cane sugar, has driven the plaintiff out of those markets to a great extent. The result frequently has been that the plaintiff has derived little or no advantage from the purchase of Louisiana sugar, even when bought at a less price than that in New York on the same day.\n The bill also shows fully that the plaintiff melts solely on its own account, so that its only contact with the public is as a buyer of raw and a seller of refined sugar, and its business is affected with a public interest not otherwise than as any other business is, according to its importance and size. It also shows that much the greater part of its Chalmette commerce, both in purchase and sale, is foreign or among the states. There are other allegations besides those that we have summed up, but enough has been stated to disclose the plaintiff's case.\n The answer alleges that the plaintiff is a monopoly and combination in restraint of trade in buying, refining, and selling sugar throughout the United States, and completely controls the sugar trade in Louisiana, and sets forth a long series of letters thought to show efforts to obtain and keep such control. It obliquely intimates that the plaintiff can fix prices on occasion even in the New York market, admitted to be the ruling one in the United States. It alleges that suits have been brought against the plaintiff by sugar planter, under the Sherman act [26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8820], for a total of near $200,000,000, and that after the exposure of the plaintiff's criminality in a suit by the United States that seems to have come to nothing, this law was passed. All of the foregoing, the main portion of the answer, is offered as ground for denying to the plaintiff any equitable relief.\n In the alternative, if the plaintiff has a standing in \n\n[241 U.S. 79, 85]\n\u00a0\n equity, the answer denies the plaintiff's explanation of the idleness of the Louisiana Refinery and avers that the statement that it buys less than half the Louisiana crop is deceptive, and that it buys 70 per cent of the raw sugar sold to refiners. It alleges that the shipping of raw sugar North is due to artificial conditions created by the plaintiff, and that but for them the whole would be 'handled locally.' It also alleges that the difference between the Louisiana and the New York price has been made less by the plaintiff since 1911, in order to prevent a repetition of the one successful combination made by the planters. Finally it alleges that the shipments to New York arrive when there is no sugar on hand, or when the first sugar from Cuba is coming in, and enable the plaintiff to influence downward the price of the Cuban sugar that it needs. Most of the allegations of the bill are denied, and it is said that the rush to sell in November and December would have found a market but for the plaintiff's wrongful deeds.\n The answer is signed by the attorney general of the state; and if he were authorized to interpret the meaning of the other voice of the state heard in act No. 10, would seem to import that the latter was a bill of pains and penalties disguised in general words. For the first division of the answer shows that the plaintiff is the only one to whom the act could apply, and that the statute was passed in view of the plaintiff's conduct, to meet it. It is upon the assumption of the latter fact that the argument is pressed that the plaintiff has no standing in equity, since it made the legislation necessary. If the connection were omitted, it would be so much the worse for the constitutionality of the act. We deem it enough to say that neither that supposed connection nor the general intimations of the plaintiff's wickedness in the answer deprive it of its constitutional rights, or prevent it from asserting them in the only practicable and adequate way. \n\n[241 U.S. 79, 86]\n\u00a0\n The statute bristles with severities that touch the plaintiff alone, and raises many questions that would have to be answered before it could be sustained. We deem it sufficient to refer to those that were mentioned by the district court: a classification which, if it does not confine itself to the American Sugar Refinery, at least is arbitrary beyond possible justice, and a creation of presumptions and special powers against it that can have no foundation except the intent to destroy. As to the classification, if a powerful rival of the plaintiff should do no refining within the state, it might systematically pay a less price for sugar in Louisiana than it paid elsewhere with none of the consequences attached to doing so in the plaintiff's case. So of anyone who purchases but does not refine. So of any concern that does not buy and refine more sugar 'than the aggregate of the sugar produced by it from cane grown and purchased by it,' as easily might happen with a combination of planters, such as the answer gives us to understand has been attempted heretofore.\n As to the presumptions, of course the legislature may go a good way in raising one or in changing the burden of proof, but there are limits. It is 'essential that there shall be some rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed, and that the inference of one fact from proof of another shall not be so unreasonable as to be a purely arbitrary mandate.' Mobile, J. & K. C. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, \n219 \nU.S. 35, 43\n, 55 S. L. ed. 78, 80, 32 L.R.A.(N.S.) 226, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 136, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 463, 2 N. C. C. A. 243. The presumption created here has no relation in experience to general facts. It has no foundation except with tacit reference to the plaintiff. But it is not within the province of a legislature to declare an individual guilty or presumptively guilty of a crime. If the statute had said what it was argued that it means, that the plaintiff's business was affected with a public interest by reason of the plaintiff's monopolizing it, and that therefore the plaintiff should be prima facie presumed guilty upon proof \n\n[241 U.S. 79, 87]\n\u00a0\n that it was carrying on business as it does, we suppose that no one would contend that the plaintiff was given the equal protection of the laws. We agree with the court below that the act must fall as a whole, as it falls in the sections without which there is no reason to suppose that it would have been passed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCINTYRE v. KAVANAUGH(1916)\nNo. 88\nArgued: November 10, 1916Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n Mr. Robert H. Patton for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Myer Nussbaum for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff in error was a member of T. A. McIntyre & Company, engaged in business as brokers. During February, 1908, the partnership received certain stock certificates owned by defendant in error, and undertook to hold them as security for his indebtedness, amounting to less than one sixth of their market value. Within a few weeks, without authority and without his knowledge, they sold the stocks and appropriated the avails to their \n\n[242 U.S. 138, 139]\n\u00a0\n own use. Shortly thereafter both firm and its members were adjudged bankrupts. After his discharge in bankruptcy this suit was instituted against plaintiff in error, seeking damages for the wrongful conversion. He set up his discharge and also personal ignorance of and nonparticipation in any tortious act.\n The trial court held the liability was for wilful and malicious injury to property and expressly excluded from release by  17 (2), Bankruptcy Act, as amended in 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 798, chap. 487, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9601), and that the several partners were liable. A judgment for damages was affirmed by appellate division (151 App. Div. 910, 135 N. Y. Supp. 1120) and court of appeals (210 N. Y. 175, 104 N. E. 135).\n That partners are individually responsible for torts by a firm when acting within the general scope of its business, whether they personally participate therein or not, we regard as entirely clear. Castle v. Ballard, 23 How. 172, 16 L. ed. 424; Re Peck, 206 N. Y. 56, 41 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1223, 99 N. E. 258, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 798. If, under the circumstances here presented, the firm inflicted a wilful and malicious injury to property, of course, plaintiff in error incurred liability for that character of wrong.\n As originally enacted,  17 of the Bankruptcy Act provided:\n'A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, except such as . . . (2) are judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations, or for wilful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another ; . . . (4) were created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity.' [30 Stat. at L. 550, chap. 541, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9601.]\n\n This was amended by Act February 5, 1903, so as to read:\n'A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, except such as . . . (2) are liabilities for obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations, or for wilful and malicious injuries \n\n[242 U.S. 138, 140]\n\u00a0\n to the person or property of another, or for alimony due or to become due, or for maintenance or support of wife or child, or for seduction of an unmarried female, or for criminal conversation; . . . or (4) were created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity.' [32 Stat. at L. 798, chap. 487, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9601.]\n\n The trial court found--\n That on February 5, 1908, McIntyre & Company by agreement obtained possession of Kavanaugh's stocks, worth approximately $25,000, and held them as security for his indebtedness, amounting to $3,853.32.\n'That almost immediately after taking over said stocks by certificates as aforesaid by the said firm of T. A. McIntyre & Company, composed as aforesaid, and commencing on the very next day, said firm of T. A. McIntyre & Company (the above-named defendants being members thereof), without any notice to the plaintiff, and without his authority, knowledge, or consent, or demand of any kind upon him, sold and disposed of the identical certificates of such stock and scrip so turned over to them as aforesaid, and placed the avails thereof in the bank account of said firm of T. A. McIntyre & Company to the credit of said firm.\n\n'That the various stocks aforesaid had all been disposed of prior to the 18th day of March, 1908, and that three quarters in value thereof had been disposed of on or prior to February 14th, 1908, or within nine days after the acquisition of the possession thereof by defendant's firm as aforesaid.\n\n'That the above-named defendants, together with the other members of the said firm of T. A. McIntyre & Company, in disposing of said stocks aforesaid, without notice to or demand upon the plaintiff, and without his authority, knowledge, or consent, and in depositing the proceeds and avails thereof in the bank account to the credit of said firm of T. A. McIntyre & Company, committed wilful and malicious injury to the property of the plaintiff. \n\n[242 U.S. 138, 141]\n\u00a0\n 'That on April 23, 1908, the said firm of T. A. McIntyre & Company filed a petition in bankruptcy in the United States district court for the southern district of New York, and were afterwards adjudicated bankrupts.\n\n'That thereafter the plaintiff in this action proved his claim against the bankrupt estate without waiving any legal rights in this action or otherwise.'\n\n To deprive another of his property forever by deliberately disposing of it without semblance of authority is certainly an injury thereto within common acceptation of the words. Bouvier's Law Dict., 'Injury.' And this we understand is not controverted; but the argument is that an examination of our several Bankruptcy Acts and consideration of purpose and history of the 1903 amendment will show Congress never intended the words in question to include conversion. We can find no sufficient reason for such a narrow construction. And instead of subserving the fundamental purposes of the statute, it would rather tend to bring about unfortunate if not irrational results. Why, for example, should a bankrupt who had stolen a watch escape payment of damages, but remain obligated for one maliciously broken? To exclude from discharge the liability arising from such transactions as those involved in Crawford v. Burke, \n195 U.S. 176\n, 49 L. ed. 147, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 9, and here presented, not improbably was a special purpose of the amendment.\n In Tinker v. Colwell, \n193 \nU.S. 473, 485\n, 487 S., 48 L. ed. 754, 759, 760, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 505, we said of original  17(2): 'In order to come within that meaning as a judgment for a wilful and malicious injury to person or property, it is not necessary that the cause of action be based upon special malice, so that without it the action could not be maintained.' And further: 'A wilful disregard of what one knows to be his duty, an act which is against good morals and wrongful in and of itself, and which necessarily causes injury and is done intentionally, may be said to be done wilfully and maliciously, so as to \n\n[242 U.S. 138, 142]\n\u00a0\n come within the exception. It is urged that the malice referred to in the exception is malice towards the individual personally, such as is meant, for instance, in a statute for maliciously injuring or destroying property, or for malicious mischief, where mere intentional injury without special malice towards the individual has been held by some courts not to be sufficient. Com. v. Williams, 110 Mass. 401. We are not inclined to place such a narrow construction upon the language of the exception. We do not think the language used was intended to limit the exception in any such way. It was an honest debtor, and not a malicious wrongdoer, that was to be discharged.'\n The circumstances disclosed suffice to show a wilful and malicious injury to property for which plaintiff in error became and remains liable to respond in damages. The judgment below is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMENASHA PAPER CO. v. CHICAGO & N.W. RY. CO.(1916)\nNo. 696\nArgued: April 3, 1916Decided: April 24, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 55, 56]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Felix J. Streyckmans for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Louis Quarles, George Lines, and Willet M. Spooner for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action for demurrage on cars in interstate and intrastate commerce, the grounds of recovery being set forth in separate counts.\n After trial judgment was entered for the railway company in the sum of $1,374.63 and $49.60 costs, being, in all, the sum of $1,424.23.\n The judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. \n\n[241 U.S. 55, 57]\n\u00a0\n There is no dispute about the facts. The railway company operates a railroad at Menasha, Wisconsin, and elsewhere. The paper company is a corporation and has a place of business adjoining the railroad of the railway company, and operated, for the purpose of unloading the cars delivered to it, a sidetrack which was contiguous to its mill and connected with the tracks of the railway company. A delay of forty-eight hours was allowed for unloading; after that time a demurrage charge of $1 per car per day was provided by the rules of the railway company.\n The sidetrack could accommodate about seven cars, but had an actual capacity, as used during the times with which the action is concerned, of three or four cars, or possibly of five. As the paper company used the sidetrack, more cars could not have been placed upon it and unloaded than were actually placed upon it and unloaded, that is, about two or three cars a day.\n Notice of the arrival of each car was given and acknowledged by telephone, and the railway company held the cars for unloading either at Menasha station, or afterwards at Snell's siding, 8 miles south of Menasha. The paper company did not ask for them sooner than shown in the complaint because it could not handle any more cars than it did. And there was neither inability nor refusal on the part of the railway company to so place the cars when so ordered.\n On March 14, 1908, the railway company, at the request of the paper company, notified its agents in Wisconsin and Michigan 'until further advised' to discontinue to furnish equipment to load with bolts (logs less than 8 feet in length) for the paper company. This arrangement, called an 'embargo,' did not run out until the close of the year, and did not by its terms cover logs, nor was it modified afterwards to cover logs. The embargo was raised at the paper company's request as to a certain \n\n[241 U.S. 55, 58]\n\u00a0\n number of cars, but was applied again, and bolts were shipped in violation thereof and without any notice from the railway company to the paper company of the intention to ship the same, resulting in the arrival of cars in great numbers on certain days.\n From these facts it was concluded by the referee, to whom the case was referred, the trial court, and the supreme court that the paper company was estopped from urging any defense other than the existence of the embargo, and that the embargo was 'illegal, contrary to public policy, and void.'\n The latter conclusion the court based on the Hepburn act (34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563) and certain sections of the Wisconsin laws.\n The case is in short compass. The first cause of action was for intrastate demurrage on logs; the second cause of action was for interstate demurrage on logs and bolts. The so-called embargo is applicable only to the bolts. The supreme court disposed of it, as we have seen, on the ground that it was opposed to the policy of the Federal and state laws, and justified the railway company in removing it. And the court found that there was no agreement that notice should be given of its removal. The removal of the embargo undoubtedly produced a congestion of cars beyond the ability of the paper company to handle on its sidetrack in its usual way.\n Two questions arise on the embargo: (1) Was it a violation of the Hepburn act? (2) If so, could the railway company recover on account of the congestion of cars resulting from its removal? That act requires railroad companies to provide and furnish transportation to shippers upon reasonable request therefor, and to exact this duty of the railway company was the right of the shippers of the bolts to the paper company. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Hardwick Farmers' Elevator Co. \n226 U.S. 426\n, 57 L. ed. 284, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 203, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174. This is not denied by the paper company, nor did that company re- \n\n[241 U.S. 55, 59]\n\u00a0\n fuse to receive the cars. It is an inference from this that the paper company recognized it was under contract obligations to the shippers to receive the bolts; indeed, the whole case supposes it. It is alleged that 'between the 3d of June, 1908, and the 20th of July, 1908, both dates included, plaintiff [the railway company], as the last carrier, carried and delivered in interstate commerce certain freight in carload' lots ( meaning the bolts). There is no denial that they were so carried. If the shippers had a right to send the bolts, necessarily the railway company was under a duty to transport them. The contention of the paper company, therefore, is tantamount to saying that the railway company performed its duty at the sacrifice of its rights. We are unable to concur in this view. The railway company violated its duty when it agreed to the embargo; it returned to its duty when it removed the embargo, and the rights which it exercised were those which it would have had if there had been no agreement between it and the paper company. The paper company had a direct remedy if it had been under no obligation to receive the bolts; it could have peremptorily notified the shippers not to send them, and such notice, under the circumstances, was an obvious course. It could not be protected from their receipt nor relieved from the obligation of their receipt by an agreement with the railway company against the duty which the law devolved upon the latter company. This duty it was deemed necessary to impose. It is positive and should be kept clear from agreements with others than the shippers which in effect stipulate for its violation. And this is the basis of our decision. If the paper company was under no obligation to receive the bolts from the shippers of them, it undoubtedly had the right to effectually notify the railway company not to receive them for shipment on its account except as it should direct. But, as we have seen, it received the cars, and this, we have said, was a recognition of the rights of \n\n[241 U.S. 55, 60]\n\u00a0\n the shippers. The cars did not arrive all at once, and a protest made at the first delivery of cars would have notified the railway company that the paper company was under no obligations to the shippers. And this certainly was the more imperative, as the railway company was the last carrier, the shipments originating on other roads.\n It seems that in the state court the paper company did not contend so much against the raising of the embargo as against the failure to give notice of it, with the consequence, it was asserted and is asserted here, of the 'dumping of a large number of cars' on the paper company 'and causing the accrual of the alleged demurrage sued for.' But the contention is based upon the legality of the embargo, it being tantamount, it is insisted, to a consignee refusing freight consigned to it, or the designation of those from whom it would receive freight. It, however, gave no notice to its consignors; it undertook to put the railway between itself and them, casting upon the railway company the hazard of the violation of its obligations, it having the ability to perform them and the shippers having the right to demand performance of them. It, besides, received the cars without protest or comment, and made no provision for their disposition. The finding is 'that defendant did not order cars placed for unloading sooner than as shown in Exhibits B and C, attached to the complaint, because, practically, defendant could not handle any more cars than it did, and hence did not ask for them.' This finding applies, of course, to the placing of cars on the paper company's sidetrack. What other accommodation and arrangements it could have made does not appear from the findings, but it was testified that the paper company, if the cars had been delivered to it, could have obtained space for unloading them. The company, however, made no demand for such delivery and the referee found that the railway company 'notified the defendant [paper company] upon each ar- \n\n[241 U.S. 55, 61]\n\u00a0\n rival by telephone, giving the car numbers, and, according to custom, with only occasional exceptions, the plaintiff held the cars until defendant notified it to place them upon the sidetrack for unloading.' And the referee also found that there was no delinquency on the part of the railway company nor insufficiency of terminal facilities.\n The next contention of the paper company (it is the first discussed) is that 'under the commerce act railroads cannot collect for any service not 'specifically set forth in the carrier's published tariffs,' and tariffs and schedules must plainly show what the charges are for.' These conditions, it is urged, were not satisfied by the rules of the company and the circumstances presented in this case.\n The rules of the company were as follows:\n'Rule 4. Cars which are stopped in transit or held by orders of shippers or consignee for reconsignment to points beyond, for change of load, for amended instructions, for change in billing, milling, shelling, cleaning, etc., or on account of improper, unsafe, or excessive loading, or for any other reason for which the shipper or consignee is responsible, shall be subject to car service charges after the expiration of forty- eight (48) hours from arrival at the point of stoppage, and all car service must be collected, or billed as advances when cars go forward.\n\n'Rule 5. . . .\n\n'Section B. Cars for unloading shall be considered placed when such cars are held awaiting orders from consignors or consignees or for the payment of freight charges after the notice mailed or otherwise given, or for the surrender of bills of lading.\n\n'Section C. The delivery of cars to private tracks shall be considered to have been made, either when such cars have been placed on the tracks designated, or, if such track or tracks be full, when the road offering the cars \n\n[241 U.S. 55, 62]\n\u00a0\n would have made delivery had the condition of such tracks permitted.'\n\n It is somewhat difficult to state succinctly the argument of counsel by which he attempted to give pertinency to the contention based on these rules. We have seen that the sidetrack of the paper company could accommodate about seven cars, but, as the company used the track, it could handle only two or three cars a day, and hence it did not ask for more. The supreme court of the state, therefore, decided that the railway way company had complied with its obligation to the paper company by complying with such demand, and was entitled to charge for demurrage. And, answering the contention of the paper company (repeated here), the court said the railway 'was not obliged to do a vain and useless thing by putting seven cars upon the track at one time, and thus prevent the practical handling or unloading of any cars thereon by appellant [paper company], contrary to its orders.' [159 Wis. 514, 149 N. W. 751.] The court, by such holding, counsel says, decided that 'the rules must have a reasonable construction.' And, further: 'This is the crux of the decision, and it is absolutely in opposition to all of the decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission and of the courts, and of the spirit and intent of the act to regulate commerce.' In other words, counsel insists that there should have been an actual filling of the tracks, even though this would have prevented their use, and have been contrary to the directions of the company, the basis of the contention being 'that the rules must be strictly construed, and that there must be 'definite tariff authority' for the charges made.' And the conclusion, it is asserted, is supported by all authorities, judicial, administrative, and legislative. Rigorously applying the test that the exact letter of the statute must be observed, counsel goes so far as to assert that there was an imperative duty upon the railway company to so fill the tracks, and this without orders. And contesting the proposition, \n\n[241 U.S. 55, 63]\n\u00a0\n decided by the supreme court of the state, that cars arriving at Menasha or Snell's siding had reached their destination, counsel says: 'It was the duty of the railroad to keep the sidetrack filled to its physical capacity before it could hold the cars 'at the nearest available point.' To hold otherwise would leave it dependent upon the judgment of the officers of the railroad as to how much unloading the consignee could do, and would therefore result in discrimination and special privileges prohibited by the act to regulate commerce.' And further: 'The carrier was derelict in its duty when it failed to fill the sidetrack to its capacity, as it had not completed its duty as a common carrier until it had placed the cars on the sidetrack of the plaintiff in error.'\n We are unable to concur in counsel's construction of the rules, or to hold that it has any such formidable support as he assigns to it. And we content ourselves with the bare assertion, not even pausing to review counsel's chief reliance, that is, United States v. Denver & R. G. R. Co. 18 Inters. Com. Rep. 7. The case has not the breadth given to it. If it had, we should be unable to follow it.\n A motion has been made to dismiss, but it is apparent from our discussion that a Federal question was presented in the case and decided by the court. The motion, therefore, must be overruled, and the judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMERRILL-RUCKGABER CO. v. U S(1916)\nNo. 281\nArgued: March 17, 1916Decided: June 5, 1916\n\n\n\n Appellant is a New York corporation. It filed a petition in the court of claims for the recovery from the United States of the sum of $4,475.90 for extra work performed in the construction of the foundation for the \n\n[241 U.S. 387, 388]\n\u00a0\n extension and remodeling of the United States assay office in New York. Issue was joined on the petition and the court of claims, after hearing, dismissed it.\n The facts pertinent to the questions presented, collated from the findings, are as follows:\n The appellant entered into a contract with the United States through the proper officers of the latter for the construction of such foundation for the sum of $79,400, in accordance with specifications and drawings prepared in the office of the supervising architect.\n The specifications required bidders to visit the site and fully inform themselves of the character of the same and the conditions under which the work would have to be performed, and failure to do so, it was provided, would not relieve the successful bidder from the necessity of furnishing material or performing any labor that might be required to complete the work in accordance with the true intent and meaning of the specifications and drawings, without additional cost to the government.\n The specifications, it was provided, should supplement the drawings, and specifications and drawings were to be reciprocally explanatory, and the decision of the supervising architect as to the proper interpretation of the drawings and specifications was to be final.\n Under the heading 'Excavation' it was provided that 'certain portions of old foundation walls, etc., have been left in place as retaining walls in connection with adjoining buildings; the removal of these walls and the north wall and so much of the present front building as may be necessary to install work under this contract and such other excavation in connection therewith as may be necessary are to be included. . . . The walls, etc., will have to be removed and the excavation made in such manner as not to endanger adjoining property nor prevent the occupancy of the present front building, and all neces- \n\n[241 U.S. 387, 389]\n\u00a0\n sary shoring and underpinning, etc., in connection therewith, must be done.'\n Subsequently the supervising architect sent to all parties from whom proposals had been solicited the following addendum amending the foregoing paragraph of the specifications:\n'Bidders are hereby informed that the specification is to be amended as follows: Page 7, fourth paragraph, under 'Excavation,' after the clause 'and all necessary shoring, underpinning, etc., in connection therewith, must be done,' add, 'In the case of the building joining the north line of the site, the underpinning of the main rear walls must be carried to rock by a method satisfactory to the supervising architect.\"\n\n A detailed contract was entered into providing that the work was to be done in accordance with the specifications and the addendum thereto and the requirements of certain specified drawings and such other detail drawings and models as might be furnished to appellant by the supervising architect.\n It was further provided that changes might be made in the work and materials when required by the United States, the value of such work and materials to be determined on the basis of the contract unit of value, at prevailing market rates, such rates, in case of dispute, to be determined by the architect, whose decision should be binding on both parties, and that no claim for damages on account of such changes or for anticipated profits should be made or allowed. No claim for extra materials or work was to be made or allowed unless specifically agreed upon in writing, or directed in writing by the United States.\n The assay office extension was located practically in the middle of the block bounded by Wall, Nassau, Pine, and William streets, and among the buildings surrounding the site were two on Pine street, numbered 25, 27, and 29. Number 25 was ten stories and Nos. 27 and 29 (being one \n\n[241 U.S. 387, 390]\n\u00a0\n building) was thirteen stories above the street, and each was one story higher at the line of the assay office extension.\n Appellant submitted detail drawings showing its proposed method of underpinning and protecting the walls of the Pine street buildings. Referring to the drawings, the architect telegraphed the inquiry why they did 'not show underpinning 25 Pine street extending to rock,' to which appellant replied that, in accordance with the addendum to the specifications, it understood that the building referred to meant 27-29 Pine street, as No. 25 Pine street had no rear wall, but simply a light metallic curtain wall supported on the side walls, and that appellant did not consider there was any rear wall in the building, and therefore it ( appellant) showed the side walls to be taken care of in the usual manner and believed its method so provided.\n Much correspondence ensued, and finally appellant was told that it was the opinion of the architect's office that its letter of the 2d instant (October, 1909) correctly set forth the position of the office, and that it was of the opinion the work as therein set forth was required by the contract, and that appellant was not entitled to extra therefor, and appellant was directed to carry out its contract without further delay, in accordance with that letter. To which appellant replied that the cost of the underpinning to rock of the walls of No. 25 Pine street would be $4, 800 in addition to the price named in the contract, and concluded as follows:\n\"As the contract does not expressly or impliedly require us to underpin to rock premises 25 Pine street, we shall proceed with the work under the contract, taking necessary steps to protect said premises, but will not underpin any portion thereof to rock except upon the understanding that we are to be paid the reasonable cost thereof, as indicated above.' \n\n[241 U.S. 387, 391]\n\u00a0\n 'To which the supervising architect replied, on October 30, 1909: 'Your statements are noted and you are now directed to proceed without further delay to complete the work in line with office letters of the 2d, 20th, and 26th instance, and without expense to the government. And you are advised that unless you take action along this line within a reasonable time consideration will be given to serving the eight days' notice preparatory to the government assuming charge of the work and completing it at your expense.'\n\n'Upon appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury the action of the supervising architect was ratified, and the claimant was directed in writing by the Secretary to proceed with said underpinning in accordance with the requirements of the supervising architect, otherwise the contract would be completed at claimant's expense. The claimant did the work under protest, and completed it and all of the work under said contract within the time stipulated in the contract. The actual cost of underpinning to rock said building No. 25 Pine street was $4,450. The contractor was paid the full amount of the contract price, $79,400.'\n\n The use of the word 'building' in the addendum to the specifications was the result of a clerical error in the office of the supervising architect. But before submitting a proposal for the work, appellant, through its president and agent, made an investigation of the site of the work and the buildings surrounding the site, and ascertained that the rear of both the buildings on Pine street adjoined the site on the north.\n Messrs. John S. Flannery and Frederio D. McKenney for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna: \n\n[241 U.S. 387, 392]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The case is in narrow compass. It involves for its solution the construction of a contract, and the rules to guide such construction we need not rehearse. To its words we at first resort, but not to one or a few of them, but to all of them as associated, and as well to the conditions to which they were addressed and intended to provide for. The argument of appellant ignores this rule. As we shall see, it makes one word dominant, controls all others by it, and puts out of view the demands of the physical conditions.\n The contract provided that whatever walls would have to be removed and excavations made would have to be done in such manner as not to endanger adjoining property, and that all necessary shoring and underpinning, etc., in connection therewith, had to be done. To this provision there was subsequently added that 'in the case of the building [ italics ours] joining the north line of the site the underpinning of the main rear walls must be carried to rock by a method satisfactory to the supervising architect.'\n But there were two buildings 'joining the north line of the site,' and appellant selected one as the full measure of its obligation to carry the underpinning to rock, as required by the specifications, giving as a reason, in a communication to the architect's office, that it did not consider that there was any rear wall in No. 25 Pine street, but only a metallic curtain wall.\n The architect's office was not impressed with the distinction between walls, and the selection of one building joining the north line of the site, but insisted that the underpinning of the main rear walls of both of the buildings joining such line must be carried to rock by a method satisfactory to the supervising architect. Appellant \n\n[241 U.S. 387, 393]\n\u00a0\n filed its appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury, who affirmed the action of the architect.\n Counsel intimates unfairness on the part of the supervising architect, but there is no just foundation for it; and, besides, there is no attempt to impugn the good faith of the Secretary of the Treasury, who sustained the decision of the architect, and the contract explicitly provides that 'the decision of the supervising architect as to the proper interpretation of the drawings and specifications shall be final.' If we may concede to appellant an ambiguity in the specifications, arising from the use of the singular word 'building,' instead of the plural word 'buildings,' against the material conditions which appellant's officers had inspected and knew of, and against, as well, the other parts of the specifications, which, among other things, call for 'rear walls' instead of a 'rear wall,' seemingly implying two buildings, and not one only, at the utmost it could only be said that there was ground for dispute, and, under the contract, the decision of the architect upon the dispute was final.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINERALS SEPARATION v.

The usual injunction, accounting, and damages are prayed for. The district court sustained the patent as to claims numbered 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12; found that the defendant had infringed each of these claims, and granted the prayer of the petition. The circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the decree of the district court and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss the bill. The case is here on writ of certiorari to review that decision.\n As stated in the specification, the claimed discovery of the patent in the suit relates 'to improvements in the process for the concentration of ores, the object being to separate metalliferous matter from gangue by means of oils, fatty acids, or other substances which have a preferential affinity for such metalliferous matter over gangue.'\n The answer denies all of the allegations of the bill and avers that in twenty-five designated United States and five British patents the process described in suit was 'fully and clearly described and claimed;' and it also avers that the claimed discovery was invented, known, and used by many persons long prior to the time when the application was made for the patent in suit. Notwithstanding this elaboration of denial, counsel for the defendant in the summarized conclusion to their brief rely upon only five of the many patents referred to as showing that the patent in suit was anticipated and is therefore invilid for want of novelty and invention, viz.: Everson (1886), Froment (Italy, 1902; Great Britain, 1903 ), Glogner (1903), Schwarz (applied for April 19, 1905, issued December 19, 1905), and Kirby (applied for October 17, 1903, issued December 18, 1906). And the defendant, a man obviously experienced in the subject, says that, in his opinion, the \n\n[242 U.S. 261, 264]\n\u00a0\n whole basis of flotation concentration was disclosed in the Everson United States patent No. 348,157 and in the Froment British patent.\n It is clear that in the prior art, as it is developed in this record, it was well known that oil and oily substances had a selective affinity or attraction for, and would unite mechanically with, the minute particles of metal and metallic compounds found in crushed or powdered ores, but would not so unite with the quartz, or rocky nonmetallic material, called 'gangue.' Haynes British patent (1860), and United States patents, Everson ( 1885), Robson (1897), and Elmore (1901). It was also well known that this selective property of oils and oily substances was increased when applied to some ores by the addition of a small amount of acid to the ore and water used in process of concentration. United States patents, Everson ( 1885), Elmore (1901), and Cattermole (1904).\n Prior to the date of the patent in suit a number of patents had been granted in this and other countries for processes aiming to make practical use of this property of oil and of oil mixed with acid in the treatment of ores, all of which, speaking broadly, consisted in mixing finely crushed or powdered ore with water and oil, sometimes with acid added, and then in variously treating the mass-'the pulp'-thus formed so as to separate the oil, when it became impregnated or loaded with the metal and metal-bearing particles, from the valueless gangue. From the resulting concentrate the metals were recovered in various ways.\n The processes, of this general character, described in the prior patents, may be roughly divided into two classes. The process in the patents of the first class is called in the record the 'surface flotation process,' and it depends for its usefulness on the oil used being sufficient to collect and hold in mechanical suspension the small particles of metal and metalliferous compounds, and by its buoyancy \n\n[242 U.S. 261, 265]\n\u00a0\n to carry them to the surface of the mixture of ore, water, and oil, thus making it possible, by methods familiar to persons skilled in the art, to float off the concentrate thus obtained into any desired receptacle. The waste material, or gangue, not being affected by the oil, and being heavier than water, sinks to the bottom of the containing vessel and may be disposed of as desired.\n The process of the other class, called in the record the 'metal sinking process,' reverses the action of the surface flotation process and is illustrated by the Cattermole U. S. patent, No. 777,273, in which oil is used to the extent of 4 per cent to 6 per cent to 10 per cent of the weight of the metalliferous mineral matter, depending on the character of the ore, for the purpose of agglomerating the oil-coated concentrate into granules heavier than water, so that they will sink to the bottom of the containing vessel, permitting the gangue to be carried away by an upward flowing stream of water.\n The process of the patent in suit, as described and practised, consists in the use of an amount of oil which is 'critical,' and minute as compared with the amount used in prior processes, 'amounting to a fraction of 1 per cent on the ore,' and in so impregnating with air the mass of ore and water used, by agitation-'by beating the air into the mass'-as to cause to rise to the surface of the mass, or pulp, a froth, peculiarly coherent and persistent in character, which is composed of air bubbles with only a trace of oil in them, which carry in mechanical suspension a very high percentage of the metal and metalliferous particles of ore which were contained in the mass of crushed ore subjected to treatment. This froth can be removed and the metal recovered by processes with which the patent is not concerned.\n It is obvious that the process of the patent in suit, as we have described it, is not of the metal sinking class, and while it may, in terms, be described as a surface \n\n[242 U.S. 261, 266]\n\u00a0\n flotation process, yet it differs so essentially from all prior processes in its character, in its simplicity of operation, and in the resulting concentrate, that we are persuaded that it constitutes a new and patentable discovery.\n The prior processes which we have described required the use of so much oil that they were too expensive to be used on lean ores, to which they were intended to have their chief application, and the efforts of investigators for several years prior to the discovery of the process in suit had been directed to the search for a means or method of reducing the amount of oil used; and it is clear from the record that approach was being made, slowly, but more and more nearly, to the result which was reached by the patentees of the process in suit in March, 1905. The Froment Great Britain patent (1903) and the Kirby United States patent ( applied for in 1903 and granted in 1906) are especially suggestive of the advance which was being made toward the desired result, but the Froment process was little more than a laboratory experiment, and has never proved of value in practice, and the Kirby process, though approaching in some respects more nearly to the end attained by the process of the patent in suit, found its preferred application in the use of an amount of oil solution equal to one fourth to three fourths in weight of the ore treated, which was prohibitive in cost.\n Into this field of investigation at this stage of its development came the patentees of the patent in suit. They were experienced metallurgists of London, of inventive genius and with financial resources, and they entered upon an investigation of the processes of oil concentration of ores which was continued through several years, and consisted of a very extended series of experiments in which the quantities of oil, of water, and of acid used and the extent and character of the agitation of the mass, under treatment resorted to, were varied to an almost un- \n\n[242 U.S. 261, 267]\n\u00a0\n paralleled extent as to each factor, and the results were carefully tabulated and interpreted. It was while pursuing a comprehensive investigation of this character, having, as the evidence shows, the special purpose in mind at the time to trace the effect on the results of the process of a reduction to the vanishing point of the quantity of oil used, that the discovery embodied in the patent in suit was made. The experimenters were working on the was reduced to about 5\/10 of 1 per cent 'on basis when it was discovered that the granulation on which the process depended practically ceased when the oleic acid (oil) was reduced to about 5\/10 of 1 per cent 'on the ore.' It was observed, however, that, as the amount of oleic acid was further reduced and the granulation diminished, there was an increase in the amount of 'float froth,' which collected on the surface of the mass, and that the production of this froth reached its maximum when about 1\/10 of 1 per cent or slightly less 'on the ore' of oleic acid was used. This froth, on collection, was found to consist of air bubbles modified by the presence of the minute amount of oil used, and holding in mechanical suspension between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the total mineral content of the mass treated. It was promptly recognized by the patentees that this froth was not due to the liberation of gas in the mass treated by the action of the dilute acid used, and its formation was at once attributed in large part to the presence of the air introduced into the mixture by the agitation which had been resorted to to mix the oil with the particles of crushed ore, which air, in bubbles, attached itself to the mineral particles, slightly coated as they were with what was necessarily an infinitesimal amount of oil, and floated them to the surface. The extent of the agitation of the mass had been increased as the experiments proceeded until the 'series of Gabbett mixers, fitted with the usual baffles, were speeded at from 1,000 to 1,100 revolutions per minute.' \n\n[242 U.S. 261, 268]\n\u00a0\n A careful consideration of the record in this case convinces us that the facts with respect to the process of the patent in suit are not overstated by the plaintiffs' witness, Adolph Liebmann, an expert of learning and experience, when he says in substance:\n'The present invention differs essentially from all previous results. It is true that oil is one of the substances used, but it is used in quantities much smaller than was ever heard of, and it produces a result never obtained before. The minerals are obtained in a froth of a peculiar character, consisting of air bubbles which, in their covering film, have the minerals embedded in such manner that they form a complete surface all over the bubbles. A remarkable fact with regard to this froth is that, although the very light and easily destructible air bubbles are covered with a heavy mineral, yet the froth is stable and utterly different from any froth known before, being so permanent in character that I have personally seen it stand for twenty-four hours without any change having taken place. The simplicity of the operation, as compared with the prior attempts, is startling. All that has to be done is to add a minute quantity of oil to the pulp, to which acid may or may not be added, agitate for from two and one half to ten minutes, and then, after a few seconds, collect from the surface the froth, which will contain a large percentage of the minerals present in the ore.'\n\n It is not necessary for us to go into a detailed examination of the process in suit to distinguish it from the processes of the patents relied on as anticipations, convinced as we are that the small amount of oil used makes it clear that the lifting force which separates the metallic particles of the pulp from the other substances of it is not to be found principally in the buoyancy of the oil used, as was the case in prior processes, but that this force is to be found, chiefly, in the buoyancy of the air bubbles introduced into the mixture by an agitation greater than and \n\n[242 U.S. 261, 269]\n\u00a0\n different from that which had been resorted to before, and that this advance on the prior art and the resulting froth concentrate so different from the product of other processes make of it a patentable discovery as new and original as it has proved useful and economical. It results without more discussion, that we fully agree with the decision of the House of Lords, arrived at upon a different record and with different witnesses, but when dealing with the equivalent of the patent in suit, in Minerals Separations v. British Ore Concentration Syndicate, 27 R. P. C. 33. In this decision Lord Shaw, speaking for the court and distinguishing the process there in suit especially from the Elmore oil flotation process, which had gone before, but which was typical of the then prior art, said: 'They (the patentees of the agitation froth process of the patent in suit) are not promoting a method of separation which had before been described, but they are engaged upon a new method of separation. Instead of relying upon the lesser specific gravity of oil in bulk, they rely upon the production of a froth by means of an agitation which not only assists the process of the minute quantities of oil reaching the minute particles of metal, but forms a multitude of air cells, the buoyancy of which air cells, forming around single particles of the metal, floats them to the surface of the liquid.'\n And Lord Atkinson said: 'In their process this mysterious affinity of oil for the metallic particles of the ore is availed of, yet the oil is used in such relatively infinitesimal quantities that the metallic particles are only coated with a thin film of it, and the lifting force is found not in the natural buoyancy of the mass of added oil, but in the buoyancy of air bubbles, which, introduced into the mixture by the more or less violent agitation of it, envelop or become attached to, the thinly oiled metallic particles, and raise them to the surface, where they are maintained by what is styled the surface tension of the water.' \n\n[242 U.S. 261, 270]\n\u00a0\n The record shows not only that the process in suit was promptly considered by the patentees as an original and important discovery, but that it was immediately generally accepted as so great an advance over any process known before that, without puffing or other business exploitation, it promptly came into extensive use for the concentration of ores in most, if not all, of the principal mining countries of the world, notably in the United States, Australia, Sweden, Chile, and Cuba, and that, because of its economy and simplicity, it has largely replaced all earlier processes. This, of itself, is persuasive evidence of that invention which it is the purpose of the patent laws to reward and protect. Diamond Rubber Co. v. Consolidated Rubber Tire Co. \n220 U.S. 428\n, 55 L. ed. 527, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 444; Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co. \n185 \nU.S. 403, 429\n, 430 S., 46 L. ed. 968, 983, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 698; Barbed Wire Patent (Washburn & M. Mfg. Co. v. Beat 'Em All Barbed Wire Co.) \n143 U.S. 275\n, 36 L. ed. 154, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 443, 450; Smith v. Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. \n93 U.S. 486\n, 23 L. ed. 952.\n The claim that the patentees of the patent in suit are not the original discoverers of the process patented because an employee of theirs happened to make the analyses and observations which resulted immediately in the discovery cannot be allowed. The record shows very clearly that the patentees planned the experiments in progress when the discovery was made; that they directed the investigations day by day, conducting them in large part personally, and that they interpreted the results. Agawam Woolen Co. v. Jordan, 7 Wall, 583-603, 19 L. ed. 177-182, rules this claim against the defendant.\n Equally untenable is the claim that the patent is invalid for the reason that the evidence shows that when different ores are treated preliminary tests mus be made to determine the amount of oil and the extent of agitation necessary in order to obtain the best results. Such variation of treatment must be within the scope of the claims, and the certainty which the law requires in patents is not greater than is reasonable, having regard to their subject matter. \n\n[242 U.S. 261, 271]\n\u00a0\n The composition of ores varies infinitely, each one presenting its special problem, and it is obviously impossible to specify in a patent the precise treatment which would be most successful and economical in each case. The process is one for dealing with a large class of substances and the range of treatment within the terms of the claims, while leaving something to the skill of persons applying the invention, is clearly sufficiently definite to guide those skilled in the art to its successful application, as the evidence abundantly shows. This satisfies the law. Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, 20 L. ed. 860; Ives v. Hamilton, \n92 U.S. 426\n, 23 L. ed. 494; and Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co. \n185 \nU.S. 403, 436\n, 437 S., 46 L. ed. 968, 985, 986, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 698.\n The evidence of infringement is clear.\n While we thus find in favor of the validity of the patent, we cannot agree with the district court in regarding it valid as to all of the claims in suit. As we have pointed out in this opinion, there were many investigators at work in this field to which the process in suit relates when the patentees came into it, and it was while engaged in study of prior kindred processes that their discovery was made. While the evidence in the case makes it clear that they discovered the final step which converted experiment into solution, 'turned failure into success' (Barbed Wire Patent [Washburn & M. Mfg. Co. v. Beat Em All Barbed Wire Co.] \n143 U.S. 275\n, 36 L. ed. 154, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 443, 450), yet the investigations preceding were so informing that this final step was not a long one, and the patent must be confined to the results obtained by the use of oil within the proportions often described in the testimony and in the claims of the patent as 'critical proportions,' 'amounting to a fraction of 1 per cent on the ore,' and therefore the decree of this court will be that the patent is valid as to claims No. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 12, and that the defendant infringed these claims, but that it is invalid as to claims 9, 10, and 11. Claims No. 4, 8, and 13 were not considered in the decrees of the two lower courts and are not in issue in this proceeding. \n\n[242 U.S. 261, 272]\n\u00a0\n The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals will be reversed, and the decision of the District Court, modified to conform to the conclusions expressed in this opinion, will be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINNEAPOLIS & ST. L.R. CO. v. BOMBOLIS(1916)\nNo. 478\nArgued: Decided: May 22, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 211, 212]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederick M. Miner and William H. Bremner for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. George B. Leonard for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 211, 215]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Counting upon the employers' liability act of 1908 (chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65), as amended by the act of 1910 (chap. 143, 36 Stat. at L. 291, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8662), the defendant in error sued in a state court to recover for the loss resulting from the death of Nanos, his intestate, alleged to have been occasioned by the negligence of the plaintiff in error while he, Nanos, was in its employ and engaged in interstate commerce.\n Whatever may have been the controversies in the trial court prior to the verdict of the jury in favor of the plaintiff, and the contentions which were unsuccessfully urged in the court below to secure a reversal of the judgment entered thereon, on this writ of error they have all but one been abandoned, and hence have all but one become negligible. As the one question here remaining was also involved in five other cases pending under the employers' liability act on writs of error to the courts of last resort of Virginia, Kentucky, and Oklahoma, those cases and this were argued together. As the other cases, however, involve additional questions, we dispose separately of this case in order to decide in this the one question which is common to them all, and thus enable the other cases, \n\n[241 U.S. 211, 216]\n\u00a0\n if we deem it is necessary to do so, to be treated in separate opinions.\n By the Constitution and laws of Minnesota in civil causes, after a case has been under submission to a jury for a period of twelve hours without a unanimous verdict, five sixths of the jury are authorized to reach a verdict, which is entitled to the legal effect of a unanimous verdict at common law. When in the trial of this case the court instructed the jury as to their right to render a verdict under such circumstances, the defendant company objected on the ground that, as the cause of action against it arose under the Federal employers' liability act,-in other words, was Federal in character,-the defendant was by the 7th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States entitled to have its liability determined by a jury constituted and reaching its conclusion according to the course of the common law, and hence to apply the state statute would be repugnant to the 7th Amendment. This objection, which was overruled and excepted to, was assigned as error in the court below, was there adversely disposed of (128 Minn. 112, 150 N. W. 385), and the alleged resulting error concerning such action is the one question which, we have said, is now urged for reversal.\n It has been so long and so conclusively settled that the 7th Amendment exacts a trial by jury according to the course of the common law, that is, by a unanimous verdict (American Pub. Co. v. Fisher, \n166 U.S. 464\n, 41 L. ed. 1079, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 618; Springville v. Thomas, \n166 U.S. 707\n, 41 L. ed. 1172, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 717; Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, \n174 U.S. 1\n, 43 L. ed. 873, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 580), that it is not now open in the slightest to question that if the requirements of that Amendment applied to the action of the state of Minnesota in adopting the statute concerning a less than unanimous verdict, or controlled the state court in enforcing that statute in the trial which is under review, both the statute and the action of the court were void because of repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States. The one \n\n[241 U.S. 211, 217]\n\u00a0\n question to be decided is therefore reduced to this: Did the 7th Amendment apply to the action of the state legislature and to the conduct of the state court in enforcing at the trial the law of the state as to what was necessary to constitute a verdict?\n Two propositions as to the operation and effect of the 7th Amendment are as conclusively determined as is that concerning the nature and character of the jury required by that Amendment where applicable. (a) That the first ten Amendments, including, of course, the 7th, are not concerned with state action, and deal only with Federal action. We select from a multitude of cases those which we deem to be leading: Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 8 L. ed. 672; Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410, 434, 12 L. ed. 213, 223; Twitchell v. Pennsylvania, 7 Wall. 321, 19 L. ed. 223; Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 \nU.S. 172, 174\n, 44 S. L. ed. 119, 120, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 77; Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 93\n, 53 S. L. ed. 97, 103. And, as a necessary corollary, (b) that the 7th Amendment applies only to proceedings in courts of the United States, and does not in any manner whatever govern or regulate trials by jury in state courts, or the standards which must be applied concerning the same. Livingston v. Moore, 7 Pet. 469, 552, 8 L. ed. 751, 781; Supreme Justice v. Murray (Supreme Justice v. United States) 9 Wall. 274, 19 L. ed. 658; Edwards v. Elliott, 21 Wall. 532, 22 L. ed. 487; Walker v. Sauvinet, \n92 U.S. 90\n, 23 L. ed. 678; Pearson v. Yewdall, \n95 U.S. 294\n, 24 L. ed. 436. So completely and conclusively have both of these principles been settled, so expressly have they been recognized without dissent or question almost from the beginning in the accepted interpretation of the Constitution, in the enactment of laws by Congress and proceedings in the Federal courts, and by state Constitutions and state enactments and proceedings in the state courts, that it is true to say that to concede that they are open to contention would be to grant that nothing whatever had been settled as to the power of state and Federal governments or the authority of state and Federal courts and their mode of procedure from the beginning. Doubtless it was \n\n[241 U.S. 211, 218]\n\u00a0\n this view of the contention which led the supreme court of Minnesota in this case and the courts of last resort of the other states in the cases which were argued with this to coincide in opinion as to the entire want of foundation for the proposition relied upon, and in the conclusion that to advance it was virtually to attempt to question the entire course of judicial ruling and legislative practice, both state and national, which had prevailed from the commencement. And it was, of course, presumably an appreciation of the principles so thoroughly settled which caused Congress, in the enactment of the employers' liability act, to clearly contemplate the existence of a concurrent power and duty of both Federal and state courts to administer the rights conferred by the statute in accordance with the modes of procedure prevailing in such courts. Indeed, it may not be doubted that it must have been the same point of view which has caused it to come to pass that during the number of years which have elapsed since the enactment of the employers' liability act and the safety appliance act, and in the large number of cases which have been tried in state courts, growing out of the rights conferred by those acts, the judgments in many of such cases having been here reviewed, it never entered the mind of anyone to suggest the new and strange view concerning the significance and operation of the 7th Amendment which was urged in this case and the cases which were argued with it.\n Under these circumstances it would be sufficient to leave the unsoundness of the proposition to the demonstration to result from the application of the previous authoritative rulings on the subject, and the force of the reasoning inherently considered upon which they were based, as also upon its convincing power so aptly portrayed by the opinions of the courts below in this and the other cases which we have said were argued along with this. Cheapeake & O. R. Co. v. Carnahan, -- Va. --, 86 S. E. 863; Chesapeake & O. \n\n[241 U.S. 211, 219]\n\u00a0\n R. Co. v. Kelly, 160 Ky. 296, 169 S. W. 736, 161 Ky. 655, 171 S. W. 185; Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Stewart, 163 Ky. 823, 174 S. W. 744; St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. Brown, -- Okla. --, 144 Pac. 1075. In view, however, of the grave misconception of the very fundamentals of our constitutional system of government which is involved in the proposition relied upon and the arguments seeking to maintain it, and the misapplication of the adjudged cases upon which the arguments rest, while not implying that the question is an open one, we nevertheless notice a few of the principal propositions relied upon.\n\n 1. \nIt is true, as pointed out in Walker v. New Mexico & S. P. R. Co. \n165 U.S. 593\n, 41 L. ed. 837, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 421, 1 Am. Neg. Rep. 768, and in American Pub. Co. v. Fisher, \n166 U.S. 464\n, 41 L. ed. 1079, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 618, that the right to jury trial which the 7th Amendment secures is a substantial one in that it exacts a substantial compliance with the common-law standard as to what constitutes a jury. But this truth has not the slightest tendency to support the contention that the substantial right secured extends to, and is operative in, a field to which it is not applicable and with which it is not concerned. It is also true, as pointed out in the cases just cited, that although territorial courts of the United States are not constitutional courts, nevertheless, as they are courts created by Congress, and exercise jurisdiction alone by virtue of power conferred by the law of the United States, the provisions of the 7th Amendment are applicable in such courts. But this affords no ground for the proposition that the Amendment is applicable and controlling in proceedings in state courts deriving their authority from state law, in the teeth of the express and settled doctrine that the Amendment does not relate to proceedings in such courts.\n\n 2. \nThe proposition that, as the 7th Amendment is controlling upon Congress, its provisions must therefore be applicable to every right of a Federal character created by Congress, and regulate the enforcement of \n\n[241 U.S. 211, 220]\n\u00a0\n such right, but in substance creates a confusion by which the true significance of the Amendment is obscured. That is, it shuts out of view the fact that the limitations of the Amendment are applicable only to the mode in which power or jurisdiction shall be exercised in tribunals of the United States, and therefore that its terms have no relation whatever to the enforcement of rights in other forums merely because the right enforced is one conferred by the law of the United States. And of course it is apparent that to apply the constitutional provision to a condition to which it is not applicable would be not to interpret and enforce the Constitution, but to distort and destroy it.\n Indeed, the truth of this view and the profound error involved in the contention relied upon is aptly shown by the further propositions advanced in argument and based upon the premise insisted upon. Thus, it is urged that if the limitation of the Amendment applies to Congress so as to prevent that body from creating a court and giving it power to act free from the restraints of the Amendment, it must also apply, unless the substance is to be disregarded and the shadow be made controlling, to the power of Congress to create a right and leave the power to enforce it in a forum to which the constitutional limitation is not applicable. But this again enlarges the Amendment by causing it not merely to put a limitation upon the power of Congress as to the courts, constitutional or otherwise, which it deems fit to create, but to engraft upon the power of Congress a limitation as to every right of every character and nature which it may create, or, what is equivalent thereto, to cast upon Congress the duty of subjecting every right created by it to a limitation that such right shall not be susceptible of being enforced in any court whatever, whether created by Congress or not, unless the court enforcing the right becomes bound by the restriction which the Amendment establishes. It is \n\n[241 U.S. 211, 221]\n\u00a0\n true that the argument does not squarely face the contention to which it reduces itself, since it is conceded that rights conferred by Congress, as in this case, may be enforced in state courts; but it is said this can only be provided such courts, in enforcing the Federal right, are to be treated as Federal courts, and be subjected pro hac vice to the limitations of the 7th Amendment. And, of course, if this principle were well founded, the converse would also be the case, and both Federal and state courts would, by fluctuating hybridization, be bereft of all real, independent existence. That is to say, whether they should be considered as state or as Federal courts would from day to day depend not upon the character and source of the authority with which they were endowed by the government creating them, but upon the mere subject-matter of the controversy which they were considering.\n But here again the error of the proposition is completely demonstrated by previous adjudications. Martin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat. 304, 330, 4 L. ed. 97, 103; Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1, 27, 28, 5 L. ed. 19, 25; Ex parte McNiel, 13 Wall. 236, 243, 20 L. ed. 624, 626; Claflin v. Houseman, \n93 U.S. 130\n, 23 L. ed. 833; Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 U.S. 275\n, 41 L. ed. 715, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 326; Second Employers' Liability Cases ( Mondou v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co.) \n223 U.S. 1\n, 55-59, 56 L. ed. 327, 348-350, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169, 1 N. C. C. A. 875. Moreover, the proposition is in conflict with an essential principle upon which our dual constitutional system of government rests; that is, that lawful rights of the citizen, whether arising from a legitimate exercise of state or national power, unless excepted by express constitutional limitation or by valid legislation to that effect, are concurrently subject to be enforced in the courts of the state or nation when such rights come within in the general scope of the jurisdiction conferred upon such courts by the authority, state or nation, creating them. This principle was made the basis of the first Federal judiciary act, and has prevailed in theory and practice ever since as to rights of every character, whether derived from constitutional grant or legisla- \n\n[241 U.S. 211, 222]\n\u00a0\n tive enactment, state or national. In fact, this theory and practice is but an expression of the principles underlying the Constitution, and which cause the governments and courts of both the nation and the several states not to be strange or foreign to each other in the broad sense of that word, but to be all courts of a common country, all within the orbit of their lawful authority being charged with the duty to safeguard and enforce the right of every citizen without reference to the particular exercise of governmental power from which the right may have arisen, if only the authority to enforce such right comes generally within the scope of the jurisdiction conferred by the government creating them. And it is a forgetfulness of this truth which doubtless led to the suggestion made in the argument that the ruling in Second Employer's Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co.) \n223 U.S. 1\n, 56 L. ed. 327, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169, 1 N. C. C. A. 875, had overthrown the ancient and settled landmarks and had caused state courts to become courts of the United States, exercising a jurisdiction conferred by Congress, whenever the duty was cast upon them to enforce a Federal right. It is true in the Mondou Case it was held that where the general jurisdiction conferred by the state law upon a state court embraced otherwise causes of action created by an act of Congress, it would be a violation of duty under the Constitution for the court to refuse to enforce the right arising from the law of the United States because of conceptions of impolicy or want of wisdom on the part of Congress in having called into play its lawful powers. But that ruling in no sense implied that the duty which was declared to exist on the part of the state court depended upon the conception that, for the purpose of enforcing the right, the state court was to be treated as a Federal court, deriving its authority not from the state creating it, but from the United States. On the contrary, the principle upon which the Mondou Case rested, while not questioning the diverse governmental sources from \n\n[241 U.S. 211, 223]\n\u00a0\n which state and national courts drew their authority, recognized the unity of the governments, national and state, and the common fealty of all courts, both state and national, to both state and national Constitutions, and the duty resting upon them, when it was within the scope of their authority, to protect and enforce rights lawfully created, without reference to the particular government from whose exercise of lawful power the right arose.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMONTELIBANO v. LA COMPANIA GENERAL DE TABACOS DE FILIPINAS(1916)\nNo. 217\nArgued: Decided: June 5, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 455, 456]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry W. Van Dyke for appellants and plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Clement L. Bouve for appellee and defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was commenced by appellants on the 4th day of March, 1911, in the court of first instance of the city of Manila. It was in its nature a suit in equity. The whole controversy turns upon the construction of certain instruments in writing, the provisions of which will be outlined in stating the case. The complaint averred that on October 25, 1905, the parties entered into a written contract whereby the tobacco company, through a representative, 'delivers to Don Alejandro Montelibano for the purpose of collection, under the conditions hereinafter expressed, the following credits.' There followed a detailed statement of the credits, mentioning the names of the debtors and the amount due from each, the aggregate being P.179,177.86. The company guaranteed the existence and legitimacy of the credits, but not the solvency of the debtors. Montelibano obligated himself to pay to the company as the value of the credits the sum of P.130,000 in instalments of P.20,000 in the month of December in each of the years 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1909, and the balance of P.50,000 in December, 1910. It was agreed that if he should pay the P. 130,000 at the times provided 'all the credits and documents of the debtors \n\n[241 U.S. 455, 457]\n\u00a0\n WHICH ARE NOW DELIVERED TO HIM AS SPECIFIcally stated in paragraph one, will be transferred to him, and consequently Don Alejandro Montelibano agreed to pay in cash to the Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas in the instalments set out the sum of 130,000 pesos, in order to acquire the ownership of the rest of the credits.' All cancelations of credits were to be made by the company upon the proposal of Don Alejandro, 'the latter, however, being authorized to issue partial receipts for whatever sums he may collect.' The company was not to advance to him any sum for use in the collection of the credits, nor to accept responsibility for actions instituted by him for their collection, 'said party accepting whatever responsibilities may arise by reason of his negotiations.' The company conferred upon him authority to conduct upon his own responsibility all negotiations by him deemed requisite for the collection of the credits; 'and in the event of any judicial action being instituted, the company shall sell to Mr. Montelibano the credit which is the object of such litigation.' The contract was publicly ratified by Montelibano and his wife, who is the other appellant, on the 10th day of November following its date, and in the ratification the instrument, besides being copied at large, was described as the document 'in which the said company ceded to the said Mr. Montelibano all the credits set forth in the same to the end that the cessionary might carry into effect the collection from all the debtors of the company of the debts set forth in the inserted document, the total amount of which aggregates the sum of 179,177 pesos and 86 centavos, by means of the authority conferred by said company upon said Mr. Montelibano to enable him to carry out upon his own responsibility all the negotiations he might deem necessary for the collection of the credits mentioned, and that in the event \n\n[241 U.S. 455, 458]\n\u00a0\n of any judicial action being instituted the company would cede in sale to Mr. Montelibano the credit which was the object of said litigation.' The wife jointed in the contract and the ratification in order to pledge certain real estate owned by her as security for the performance of the contract by her husband.\n The complaint averred that appellants had taken all steps possible to carry into effect the collection of the credits, but had only been able to collect amounts aggregating P.29,491.04; that the remaining credits set forth in the first clause of the contract did not exist in the amount therein stated, and were not legitimate in their nature, and for this reason, in spite of plaintiff's efforts to collect them, it had been impossible to do so. Plaintiffs claimed that defendant company was responsible to the plaintiffs for damages in the sum of P.129,734.29, and prayed that they might recover this amount, and that the contract of October 25, 1905, and the mortgages given to secure it, might be canceled.\n The appellee filed an answer and a cross complaint setting up the contract of October 25, 1905, and the ratification of November 10, and also an agreement afterwards made between the parties under date December 7, 1908, supplemental to and modifying in certain respects the previous contract; setting up that defendant had complied with all the terms and conditions of these contracts on its part to be performed; that Montelibano had paid defendant only P.20,736.95 on account of the instalments agreed to be paid 'under the provisions of said contracts whereby the said plaintiff had the option of purchasing and acquiring the ownership of said credits for the sum of P.130,000;' that after the expiration of the term of the option, when he was by the terms and conditions of the contracts obligated to account for all sums of principal and interest collected on account of said credits, and to return to defendant all credits remaining \n\n[241 U.S. 455, 459]\n\u00a0\n uncollected, defendant demanded of said plaintiff an accounting of his transaction in connection with the credits as agent of the defendant, and payment of all sums of principal and interest collected, but he refused to comply with the demand to pay over any sum collected by him, to render accounts, or in any manner to comply with his obligations under the contracts. Defendant prayed that the action of plaintiffs be dismissed; that the plaintiff Alejandro Montelibano be required to render an accounting of the sums collected by him, of the credits remaining uncollected, and of all his transactions under the contracts, and that judgment be rendered in favor of defendant and against the plaintiff Alejandro for the sum found to be due; that a receiver be appointed to care for the uncollected credits and the mortgaged property; and for other relief.\n Before trial plaintiffs asked for a dismissal of the action. The motion to this effect was denied, and the case came on for hearing upon defendant's prayer for affirmative relief and for an accounting and damages. The trial court treated the contract as turning over the credits to Montelibano for collection for defendant's account, subject to an option to purchase the entire amount of credits for the sum of P.130,000, payable in instalments strictly as prescribed by the contract; found that he had not only failed to pay the stipulated instalments in order to avail himself of the option, but had not turned over or accounted for the amount actually collected by him; that he had collected P.61,715.98, and paid over only P.20,736.95, leaving a balance collected by him and undelivered to the defendant of P.40,979.03, in addition to which certain claims against Emilio Escay and Quirino Gamboa had been prosecuted to judgment and execution, and the property of the debtors acquired by Montelibano through the execution sales, and that these properties were held by Montelibano in trust for the \n\n[241 U.S. 455, 460]\n\u00a0\n company. 'The conclusions are that the plaintiff having failed to perform the contract on his part, the defendant is entitled to a return of his [ its] property in so far as it can be returned, and to judgment for the value of the balance which cannot be returned, which value must be determined as the proceeds which the plaintiff received from such claims, together with legal interest upon the amount of cash received by the plaintiff upon such claims from the time of the commencement of this action, which was by filing the complaint herein on the 4th day of March, 1911.'\n Judgment was therefore entered in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff Montelibano for the sum of P.40,979.03, less P.22,086.43 ( the amount of the Escay debt) if defendant should seek to recover the Escay property from plaintiff, with interest from March 4, 1911, the date of the commencement of the action; also for the possession and delivery of certain enumerated credits aggregating P.103,645.70; also for the Escay property, and in case delivery thereof could not be had, the sum of P.40, 000, the value thereof, provided defendant did not elect to take the full judgment for money collected as above stated, and if such election should be made, then this clause in relation to the return of the property to be annulled; also for the property known as the Gamboa property, or, in case delivery thereof could not be had, the sum of P.6,178.10; and for the costs.\n The supreme court of the Philippine Islands affirmed this judgment, holding that the title to the credits never passed to the plaintiff Alejandro Montelibano; that they were delivered into his possession for collection, with an agreement that he could become the owner thereof by paying P.130,000 in the manner specified; that none of these payments having been made as agreed, the credits remained the property of the defendant company, and a refusal to deliver them was properly the basis of a demand for affirmative relief. \n\n[241 U.S. 455, 461]\n\u00a0\n The case comes to this court under  10 of the act of July 1, 1902 ( chap. 1369, 32 Stat. at L. 691, 695, Comp. Stat. 1913,  3804, 1225), on account of the amount in controversy. The action being of an equitable nature, the proper method of review is by appeal, and the writ of error will be dismissed.

Rep. 518.\n The principal contention of appellants, and the one upon which all others turn, is that the court of first instance and the supreme court of the Islands erred in holding that, under the terms of the contracts of October 25, 1905, and December 7, 1908, the credits involved were delivered to the appellant Alejandro Montelibano not as purchaser, but merely as agent for purposes of collection, with an option to purchase that was not carried out, and that therefore the tobacco company was entitled to the proceeds so far as collected, and a return of the uncollected credits or their value. In support of this there is an elaborate argument respecting the construction of the instruments in question. It concedes that many of their clauses are consistent with the view that Montelibano had but an option to purchase the credits, and that if this option were not accepted he was to account to the company for all that he collected; but it is argued that other clauses and the general intent of the agreements are to the contrary. It would be tedious to recited the argument in detail, and we content ourselves with saying that it has not convinced us that the courts below clearly erred; and since they concurred in their findings both upon questions of fact and upon questions of law, it is our duty to affirm their judgment.

RAMEY(1916)\nNo. 61\nArgued: December 9, 1915Decided: January 10, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 538, 539]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Oliver O. Haga, James H. Richards, and McKeen F. Morrow for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 538, 544]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Will R. King for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit to quiet the title to an unsurveyed island in the Snake river, a navigable stream, the thread of which at that place is the dividing line between the states of Oregon and Idaho. The island lies between the main channel and the bank on the Idaho side, and is separated from the latter by a lesser channel from 100 to 300 feet in width, which carries a considerable part of the waters of the river, save when it is at its lower stages. The plaintiffs hold patents from the United States, issued in 1890 and 1892, for certain lots on the Idaho side, opposite the island, and claim it under these patents, while the defendant insists that it remains public land, and that he has a possessory right to it, acquired by settling thereon in 1894, and subsequently improving and cultivating it. \n\n[239 U.S. 538, 545]\n\u00a0\n The island contains about 120 acres, has banks rising abruptly above the water, is of stable formation, has a natural growth of grass and of trees suitable for firewood, and evidently has been in its present condition since long before the adjacent lands on the Idaho side were surveyed, which was in 1868. The field notes and plat represented the survey as extending to the river, but made no mention of the island. They also represented the lots or fractional tracts immediately opposite the island as containing 110.40 acres. The patents under which the plaintiffs claim described the lots by giving the numbers assigned and the acreage accredited to them on the plat, and then saying, 'according to the official plat of the survey of the said land returned to the General Land Office by the Surveyor General.' The trial court concluded that the island remained unsurveyed public land, and that the plaintiffs' lands extended only to the river, and rendered judgment against the plaintiffs. They appealed, and the supreme court of the state held, one member dissenting, that the patents passed the title not only to the lots as shown on the plat, but also to all islands lying between them and the thread of the stream. The judgment was accordingly reversed and a new trial ordered to determine whether the plaintiffs had lost title to the island through adverse possession. 14 Idaho, 598, 95 Pac. 513. Upon the new trial judgment was given for the plaintiffs and the defendant appealed. The supreme court, in deference to our intermediate decision in Scott v. Lattig, \n227 U.S. 229\n, 57 L. ed. 490, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 107, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 242, then recalled its decision upon the first appeal, reversed the judgment rendered upon the second trial, and remanded the cause with a direction to dismiss it. 25 Idaho, 1, 136 Pac. 608. The plaintiffs bring the case here.\n While the inference naturally arising from the silence of the field notes and plat is that the island was not there at the time of the survey, or, if there, was a mere sand bar or of inconsiderable area and value, what is shown and \n\n[239 U.S. 538, 546]\n\u00a0\n conceded respecting its stable formation, elevation, size, and appearance, completely refutes this inference, and demonstrates that the island was in its present condition at the time of the survey and when Idaho became a state, which was twenty-two years later.\n Thus the facts bearing on the status of the island and the operation of the patents are essentially the same as in Scott v. Lattig; and, in view of what was there held, it suffices to say: The error of the surveyor in failing to extend the survey over the island did not make it any the less a part of the public domain. It was fast, dry land, and neither a part of the bed of the river nor land under water, and therefore did not pass to the state of Idaho on her admission into the Union, but remained public land as before. The deseriptive terms in the patents embraced the lots abutting on the river, as shown on the plat, but not this island lying between the lots and the thread of the stream. Chapman & D. Lumber Co. v. St. Francis Levee Dist. \n232 U.S. 186\n, 58 L. ed. 564, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 297; Gauthier v. Morrison, \n232 U.S. 452\n, 58 L. ed. 680, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 384; Producers Oil Co. v. Hanzen, \n238 U.S. 325\n, 59 L. ed. 1330, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 755. The claim that the island passed under the patents is therefore ill-founded. The case of Whitaker v. McBride, \n197 U.S. 510\n, 49 L. ed. 857, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 530, upon which the plaintiffs rely, is distinguishable in that what was there claimed to be an island contained only 22 acres and was not shown to be of stable formation, and the Land Department had repeatedly refused to treat it as public land.\n It is contended that the decision upon the first appeal became the law of the case, and that by recalling that decision when considering the second appeal the court infringed upon the due process of law clause of the 14th Amendment. The contention must fail. There is nothing in that or any other clause of the 14th Amendment which prevents a state from permitting an appellate court to alter or correct its interlocutory decision upon a first appeal when the same case, with the same \n\n[239 U.S. 538, 547]\n\u00a0\n parties, comes before it again; and whether this is permitted is a question of local law, upon which the decision of the highest court of the state is controlling here. King v. West Virginia, \n216 \nU.S. 92, 100\n, 54 S. L. ed. 396, 401, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 225; John v. Paullin, \n231 U.S. 583\n, 58 L. ed. 381, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 178.\n It also is contended that, under the due process of law clause of such Amendment, the court was not at liberty, upon the second appeal, to change its first decision, because, after the case was remanded for a new trial, the defendant acquiesced in that decision by an amendment to his answer completely eliminating from the case all controversy respecting the status of the island and the operation of the patents. This contention is without any real basis in the record. The original answer is not before us, but the amended one is, and it, in addition to otherwise traversing the plaintiffs' allegation of ownership, expressly denies that they or either of them 'have any right, title, or interest whatever in any portion' of the island. And examining the evidence taken on the second trial we find that the defendant was then still insisting that the island was public, and not private, land. It is idle, therefore, to claim that the point involved in the first decision was completely eliminated from the case between the two appeals. Whether, if the record were otherwise, it could be said that there was an abuse of due process, need not be considered.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMT. VERNON-WOODBERRY COTTON DUCK CO. v. ALABAMA INTERSTATE POWER(1916)\nNo. 200\nArgued: Decided: January 24, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. H. N. Randolph and Edwin G. Baetjer for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Thomas W. Martin, Ray Rushton, and Lawrence Macfarlane for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a petition for a writ of prohibition to prevent the probate court of Tallapoosa county from taking \n\n[240 U.S. 30, 31]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction of condemnation proceedings instituted by the Alabama Interstate Power Company to take land, water, and water rights belonging to the petitioner. An alternative writ was issued, but the supreme court of the state ordered it to be quashed and the writ to be dismissed. 186 Ala. 622, 65 So. 287. The grounds of the petition are that the statutes of Alabama do not authorize the proceedings, and that if they do they contravene the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The supreme court upheld the statutes and the jurisdiction of the probate court, but left the sufficiency of the petition for condemnation, whether every subject of which condemnation was sought could be condemned, and the ability of the Power Company to prove its case, to be determined in the condemnation case. There is a motion to dismiss the writ of error on the ground that the present decision is not final because it does not determine the merits; but this motion must be denied. Prohibition is a distinct suit and the judgment finally disposing of it is a final judgment within the meaning of the Judicial Code, act of March 3, 1911, chap. 231,  237, 36 Stat. at L. 1087, 1156, Comp. Stat. 1913,  968, 1214, under the statutes of Alabama and by the common law. Code of 1907,  4864-4867, 4872; Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 464, 465, 7 L. ed. 481, 486, 487. The fact that it does not decide the merits of the principal suit is immaterial. It is not devoted to that point, but only to the preliminary question of the jurisdiction of the court in which that suit is brought.\n The argument in favor of granting the writ, presented by the plaintiffs in error, is addressed in great part to matters with which this court has no concern. It is argued that the probate court could not be given jurisdiction of the condemnation proceedings consistently with the Constitution of the state; that under the same instrument the state legislature had no power to pass the condemnation acts; that the petition was insufficient to found jurisdiction of the case and was defective in various \n\n[240 U.S. 30, 32]\n\u00a0\n ways; that a part of the condemnation sought was bad under the statutes in any event; and that certain words in the Alabama Code under which it is sought to condemn rights below the contemplated dam of the Power Company never were properly enacted by the legislature of the state. All these points must be taken to have been decided adversely to the plaintiff in error by the supreme court of Alabama so far as they might furnish grounds for prohibition, and they all are matters on which this court follows the supreme court of the state.\n The principal argument presented that is open here, is that the purpose of the condemnation is not a public one. The purpose of the Power Company's incorporation, and that for which it seeks to condemn property of the plaintiff in error, is to manufacture, supply, and sell to the public, power produced by water as a motive force. In the organic relations of modern society it may sometimes be hard to draw the line that is supposed to limit the authority of the legislature to exercise or delegate the power of eminent domain. But to gather the streams from waste and to draw from them energy, labor without brains, and so to save mankind from toil that it can be spared, is to supply what, next to intellect, is the very foundation of all our achievements and all our welfare. If that purpose is not public, we should be at a loss to say what is. The inadequacy of use by the general public as a universal test is established. Clark v. Nash, \n198 U.S. 361\n, 49 L. ed. 1085, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 676, 4 Ann. Cas. 1171; Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Min. Co. \n200 \nU.S. 527, 531\n, 50 S. L. ed. 581, 583, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 301, 4 Ann.

L. ed. 696, 705, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 353. We perceive no ground for the distinction attempted between the taking of rights below the contemplated dam, such as these are, and those above. Compensation is provided for according to rules \n\n[240 U.S. 30, 33]\n\u00a0\n that the court below declares to be well settled and that appear to be adequate. The details as to what may be taken and what not under the statutes and petition are not open here. Before a corporation can condemn rights it is required to have obtained, by other means, at least an acre on each side of the stream for a dam site, and this is supposed to show that the use is not public. It is only a reasonable precaution to insure good faith. A hardly consistent argument is that the dam should be built before the necessity of taking waters below can be shown. But a plan may show the necessity beforehand. All that we decide is that no general objection based on these grounds affects the jurisdiction of the probate court of the constitutionality of the act.\n Certain exceptions from the powers conferred, such as private residences, lands of other corporations having similar powers, and cotton factories, subject to the taking of the excess of water over that in actual use or capable of use at normal stages of the stream, are too plainly reasonable so far as they come in question here to need justification. Discrimination is alleged, but not argued. We see nothing that runs against the 14th Amendment. The right given to take possession before the compensation is finally determined also is not argued. Williams v. Parker, \n188 \nU.S. 491, 502\n, 47 S. L. ed. 559, 562, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 440.

By various pleas the insurance company set up that application upon which policies were based contained material representations both false and fraudulent. In reply the executors denied truth of each plea, and also alleged that if appli- \n\n[241 U.S. 613, 615]\n\u00a0\n cation contained any misrepresentations, the actual circumstances were known to company when policies issued.\n Two separate application blanks, each plainly printed upon a large, single sheet, were filled out and presented.

(Under the company's rules, where insurance applied for amounted to $30, 000, two medical examinations were required.)\n At the top of each sheet the following appears: 'THIS APPLICATION made to the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York is the basis and a part of a proposed contract of insurance, subject to the charter of the company and the laws of the state of New York.

C. Kilpatrick,\n\n\n M. D.\n\n\n Medical Examiner.\n The four policies, after being signed in New York by the president, secretary, and registrar of the company, were delivered to assured in Florida. Among others, they contain these clauses:\n'This policy and the application herefor, copy of which is indorsed hereon or attached hereto, constitutes the entire contract between the parties hereto. All statements made by the insured shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations, and not warranties, and no such statement of the insured shall avoid or be used in defense to a claim under this policy unless contained in the written application herefor, a copy of which is indorsed hereon or attached hereto.' 'Agents are not authorized to modify this policy or to extend the time for paying a premium.'\n\n During summer of 1907 assured suffered serious pains in his head, and, after consulting more than one physician, went to a sanitarium at Montgomery, Alabama, and was there operated on for a cystic enlargement of the lower jaw caused by an impacted wisdom tooth. He was confined to the sanitarium for ten days and remained under \n\n[241 U.S. 613, 618]\n\u00a0\n immediate care of a physician from July 16th to August 13th, 1907.\n Early in November, 1908, he applied to Prudential Insurance Company of America through J. C. Hogue, a special agent operating under J. R. Tapia, its manager at Mobile, Alabama, for insurance amounting to $40,000. The application was accompanied, according to its requirements, by two medical reports dated November 3d and 4th, signed respectively by Dr. J. C. McLeod and Dr. Geo. C. Kilpatrick. Several weeks later the company indicated unwillingness to accept risk because of location, but the application, although marked 'withdrawn,' was retained. At this time Wiggins had $30,000 insurance with the Prudential, $20,000 with the Equitable, and $5,000 with fraternal insurance companies.\n The application of petitioner now under consideration resulted from earnest and persistent solicitation by the same J. C. Hogue. The circumstances under which papers were prepared and signed are not entirely clear; but it appears without contradiction that they were not signed by assured in Torrey's presence-there was no personal acquaintance between the two men. Also that neither medical report was signed by assured in presence of Dr. Geo. C. Kilpatrick or Dr. J. S. Turberville; and that neither physician made the personal examination certified by him. The physicians filled the blanks and signed their names at Hogue's request and because of his representations. Through Torrey, petitioner's district manager at Mobile, the application was forwarded to New York, and, relying upon its statements, officers there issued policies and sent them to assured with copies of application papers which, by reference, were incorporated therein. So far as appears, assured accepted them without objection and paid the premiums.\n An effort was made to show that facts concerning Wiggins's medical history, former unsuccessful application to \n\n[241 U.S. 613, 619]\n\u00a0\n Prudential, and circumstances surrounding transactions now in question, were known by Hogue, the medical examiners, or Torrey, each of whom, it is claimed, was petitioner's agent.\n Assured was sixty-one years of age, president of a lumber company, apparently a man of considerable wealth, and experienced in insurance matters.\n At conclusion of evidence, counsel for insurance company asked a directed verdict. This was refused; and the court in effect instructed the jury: That in order for company successfully to defend upon ground of false statements, these must have been material, and made by Wiggins with knowledge of their falsity, and with a fraudulent purpose,-that is, with intent to deceive. That if they believed it knew of their falsity when application was accepted, no defense could be based upon them. That it knew the actual facts if the jury 'should find that an agent whose knowledge would be the knowledge of the defendant did so know.' But if the jury found that falsity of statements was within knowledge of Hogue and Torrey and medical examiners, and further found an understanding, tacit or express, between Wiggins and said agents to procure the policies by collusive co-operation to conceal the truth, there could be no recovery. Excerpts which follow fairly indicate general import of charge:\n'The contract of insurance in this case as expressed by the policies, embraces the statements and representations of Wiggins, the deceased, made to the agent, Hogue, or to Kilpatrick, or Turberville, the medical examiners. Such statements were required to be truthfully made, and was a condition for the issuance of the contract, and this contract provides that all statements made by the insured shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations, and not warranties. Whether the representations made by Wiggins in his application for insurance had been rejected; or whether he had been treated in a cure, san- \n\n[241 U.S. 613, 620]\n\u00a0\n itarium, or hospital; or whether he had undergone a surgical operation; or whether he had had any illness or disease; or whether he had consulted a physician for his health, to serve as a defense by the company to this action, depends on whether such statements were knowingly false and fraudulently made.\n\n'If Wiggins knew they were false, and that he made them with the fraudulent purpose of obtaining the policy of insurance, then such statements would avoid the policy and would serve as a good defense by the company; provided, that the company, at the time it accepted the application of the deceased as an insurance risk, had no knowledge of the falsity of the statements and representations made by Wiggins in his application for insurance.\n\n'The knowledge of the agent of the insurance company would be the knowledge of the company, and if the agent representing the company in taking the application, or the statements of the medical examiners had knowledge of the falsity of the statements, then the insurance company would be estopped from setting up such false statements or misrepresentations of which they had knowledge before the issuance of the policy, as a defense to this action.\n\n . . .\n'If you find from the evidence that the statements of Wiggins in the several matters inquired about his health and operation and treatment in a sanitarium were false, and further find that the agents Hogue, and Torrey and Turberville knew they were false, and you further find from the evidence that there was an understanding, tacit or expressed, between Wiggins and the said agents to procure the policies by collusive co- operation to conceal the truth from the company as to the several matters inquired about, then such conduct upon the part of Wiggins would avoid the policies, and the plaintiffs could not recover in this action.'\n\n Petitioner made timely objections and presented special \n\n[241 U.S. 613, 621]\n\u00a0\n requests, setting forth its theory, which were denied. The circuit court of appeals affirmed a judgment upon verdict for respondents. Among other things it said (127 C. C. A. 467, 470, 471, 211 Fed. 31, 34, 35):\n'That, under the language of the policies involved in this suit, the defendant, to avoid the policies for false representations, must establish their falsity, materiality, and the knowledge of the insured, actual or imputed, of their falsity.\n\n . . .\n'This leaves for consideration the representation of the insured that he had been examined by Dr. Turberville, defendant's medical examiner, and that the answers recorded by the medical examiner in his report were correct. In truth, there was no such examination had, and the insured must have known that there was none, and the representation that there had been one was a material one. So with regard to the representation of the insured that there had been no previous application for insurance made by him and rejected, or not passed upon favorably by the insurance company. This was untrue, must have been known to have been untrue by the insured when he made it, and it was material. Either of these two last representations would be sufficient to avoid the policies, unless the defendant is estopped to rely upon them, by reason of its knowledge of their falsity. It had such knowledge, if at all, because of the knowledge of its agents and examiners, who handled the matter for it.' And further ( p. 37): 'The statute [ 2765, General Statutes of Florida-copied in margin] prescribes that every \n\n[241 U.S. 613, 622]\n\u00a0\n person who receives money for an insurance company in payment of a contract of insurance, or who directly or indirectly causes to be made any contract of insurance, shall be deemed to all intents and purposes an agent or representative of such company. Under this description, we think Torrey, the defendant's Mobile manager, Hogue, the soliciting agent, and the two medical examiners, were agents of the defendant to all intents and purposes, and so, for the purpose of charging it with notice of what they know, when the policies were written.'\n\n All parties treat the policies as Florida contracts. The medical examiners' reports are plainly integral parts of application, and by apt words the latter became an essential constituent of the policies.\n Considered in most favorable light possible, the above quoted incorrect statements in the application are material representations; and, nothing else appearing, if known to be untrue by assured when made, invalidate the policy without further proof of actual conscious design to defraud.

We assume Hogue, Torrey, and the medical examiners were in fact designated agents of the company, with power to bind it within their apparent authority; and in such circumstances the statute does not affect their true relationship to the parties.

He could claim nothing because of such information in the keeping of unfaithful subordinates. Moreover, the false representations accompanied and were essential parts of the policies finally accepted. He did not repudiate, and therefore adopted and approved, the \n\n[241 U.S. 613, 624]\n\u00a0\n representations upon which they were based.

IBERIA DRAINAGE DIST.(1916)\nNo. 141\nArgued: December 16, 1915Decided: January 10, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 478, 479]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edgar H. Farrar for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. L. Tasker Dulany for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Suit to restrain the sale of plaintiff in error's land about to be made, it is alleged, by defendants in error, to collect a tax of 5 mills for four years, aggregating the sum of $2,000 and penalties. (We shall refer to the parties as plaintiff and defendants, respectively, that being their relation in the state courts.)\n There is no dispute about the state laws. It is stated in plaintiff's brief that it is a matter of ordinary geographic knowledge that large portions of the flat lands in Louisiana adjacent to the Gulf coast are subject to fluvial or tidal overflow and must be leveed and drained by systems of general and special public levees and drains. To this end \n\n[239 U.S. 478, 480]\n\u00a0\n legislation has been enacted, beginning in 1888 and receiving constitutional sanction in 1898 (art. 281). By an act passed in 1900 (Acts of 1900, p. 12) previous statutes were consolidated and it was provided that when the drainage of any locality was such that, in the opinion of the police juries of the respective parishes, it should become necessary to organize or create a drainage district composed partly of land situated in adjoining parishes, then such drainage district should be created by joint action of the police juries of the respective parishes.\n The districts were authorized to issue bonds for drainage purposes and levy a 5-mill tax on all property subject to taxation situated in them. The statute was amended in details and re-enacted in 1902 and 1910 (Acts of 1902, p. 293; Acts of 1910, p. 542).\n Acting under these statutes the police juries of the adjoining parishes of Iberia and St. Mary organized the drainage district with which the case at bar is concerned, and the organization of which is attacked.\n The ground of the attack is that the district for the construction and maintenance of which the tax was levied was of no benefit to plaintiff's land and was formed only for the benefit of the other lands, was an unconstitutional usurpation of authority, and was and is an effort to take plaintiff's property without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n The case was heard upon the petition in the case and an exception by defendants of no cause of action. The court dissolved the injunction that had been theretofore granted and dismissed the suit with an award of costs and attorneys' fees. Judgment was entered accordingly and sustained by the supreme court of the state.\n The trial court held that the gist of plaintiff's demand was to the effect that no benefit was or would be derived by its property by the general drainage system and the levy \n\n[239 U.S. 478, 481]\n\u00a0\n and collection of the tax on its property. The court said the question presented by the demand was no longer an open one. The principle laid down by the courts, it was declared, is that the creation and determination of drainage districts being a legitimate and lawful exercise of discretionary powers, the courts are without power to impugn or inquire into motives 'where no fraud is pleaded.' The supreme court affirmed the action of the district court and the principle upon which it was based, saying that that court accepted the view as correct 'that the decisions heretofore rendered settle the question forever that the local authorities as to drainage have the absolute right to organize drainage districts and give them shape and boundary lines as they choose.' And it was further said: 'It is upon that theory that the case is before us for decision; . . . without an element of fraud alleged, the court properly dismissed the suit. . . . Here no fraud has been alleged, nor its equivalent.' [134 La. 905, 906, 64 So. 825 .] Prior cases were cited.\n Is this a correct view of the petition? The principle of law involved in the answer to the question is well known. There is no doubt that the legislature of a state may constitute drainage districts and define their boundaries, or may delegate such authority to local administrative bodies, as, in the present case, to the police juries of the parishes of the state, and that their action cannot be assailed under the 14th Amendment unless it is palpably arbitrary and a plain abuse. Houck v. Little River Drainage Dist. decided November 29, 1915 [\n239 U.S. 254\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 58]. Does the district under review come within the principle or its limitation? Was it formed in an arbitrary manner and in plain abuse of power? The answer depends upon the allegations of the petition, which, being excepted to for insufficiency in law, must be taken as true.\n We condense them narratively as follows: Weeks is- \n\n[239 U.S. 478, 482]\n\u00a0\n land, the property which is the subject of the controversy, is one of several islands, being the highest uniform elevation above sea level in southwest Louisiana. It rises abruptly 175 feet or more, is surrounded on two sides by bayous, on the rear by a salt-water marsh, and on the front by a bay (Vermilion bay), with a small strip of salt-water marsh intervening.\n Its topography is high and rolling, the drainage excessive, and washing and erosion are serious problems. The country around it outside of the sea marsh is thickly settled and presents the character of low lands as distinguished from high lands or uplands, reaching a maximum elevation of about 15 feet as against a maximum elevation of Weeks island of 175 feet.\n In lieu of needing drainage the problem the island is confronted with 'is to guard against washing and erosion, and that the drainage of all of the territory between it and Bayou Teche on all sides and to all extents leads to the marshes subject to tidal overflow between it and the mainland.'\n Some years ago a drainage district, known as the Iberia & S. Mary Drainage District, was organized at the instigation of interested individuals for the purpose of drainage into the bayous and marshes surrounding Weeks island of certain lands lying between Bayou Teche and the marshes.\n Solely with the view of deriving revenues from the assessment of Weeks island and the salt deposit therein, and only for the benefit of the other properties, and not upon the theory that a general scheme of drainage would inure to the benefit of all of the property therein, even indirectly, and not through an exercise of sound and legal legislative discretion, the island was included within the confines of the district. In pursuance of such scheme and plan an election was held for the imposition of an ad valorem tax of 5 mills for a period of forty years \n\n[239 U.S. 478, 483]\n\u00a0\n upon which to predicate an issue of bonds. The election resulted in the imposition of the tax.\n It was not intended nor has it ever been intended, nor was it possible nor is it possible, to give any of the benefits of the drainage scheme to Weeks island or to the salt deposit therein, directly or indirectly, its inclusion in the district being solely and only for the purpose of deriving revenue therefrom for the special benefit of the other lands subject to be improved by drainage, without any benefit to plaintiff or its property whatever. The island is the highest assessed piece of property in the district, and has never received one single cent of benefit from the drainage system constructed and maintained in such district, and never can or will in the future receive any benefit whatever from the system.\n Plaintiff has uniformly, for the reasons detailed, refused to pay the tax, and at no time prior to this year has an effort been made to collect the same, plaintiff having based its refusal to pay on its constitutional rights. But at the instance of the commissioners of the district the sheriff and ex-officio tax collector of Iberia parish has demanded the tax on the island and its salt mine, and is about to advertise the property as delinquent for the period of four years, aggregating $2,000 with the addition of the penalties provided by law.\n The inclusion of the island within the district is charged to be an unconstitutional usurpation of authority and an effort to take plaintiff's property without due process of law. A like charge is made as to the assessment of the tax and its collection.\n There is no doubt that a Federal right was asserted. Indeed, plaintiff was at pains, it says, 'not to invoke for its protection any provision of the Constitution and laws of the state of Louisiana; not to make any attack upon any law of the state of Louisiana or of any of its subdivisions.' And, further, the pleadings 'were deliber- \n\n[239 U.S. 478, 484]\n\u00a0\n ately cast in this form so as to exclude every question of local or state law and to compel the consideration and decision of the Federal question only.'\n But, notwithstanding the studied effort so made and declared, defendants contend that plaintiff missed its purpose and that a Federal question was neither presented to the courts below nor decided by them, and a motion is made to dismiss. It is said that 'under the law of Louisiana the action of the legislative body (the police jury), in the exercise of its discretion as to what property shall be included in a drainage district, will not be inquired into by the court, except upon a special averment of fraud, which is not pleaded.' And such decision, it is further contended, was a decision upon the state law, and presents no Federal question, the statute of the state not being attacked.\n We cannot concur in the contention. It is true the law of the state as written is not attacked, but the law as administered and justified by the supreme court of the state is attacked, and it is asserted to be a violation of the Constitution of the United States. The question presented is Federal and the motion to dismiss is denied. And the considerations that move a denial of the motion move a decision of the merits of the question.\n The charge is that plaintiff's property was included in the district not in the exercise of 'legal legislative discretion,' not that the scheme of drainage would inure to the benefit of the property, even indirectly, but with the predetermined 'purpose of deriving revenues to the end of granting a special benefit to the other lands subject to be improved by drainage, without any benefit' to plaintiff 'or its property whatever,' present or prospective.\n Nothing could be more arbitrary if drainage alone be regarded. But there may be other purposes, defendants say, and, besides, that the benefit to the property need not be direct or immediate; it may be indirect, such as might \n\n[239 U.S. 478, 485]\n\u00a0\n accrue by reason of the general benefits derived by the surrounding territory. But such benefit is excluded by the averments, and it certainly cannot be said that the elevated land of Weeks island could be a receptacle for stagnant water, or would be otherwise a menace to health if not included within the district, or would defeat the purpose of the law, which seems to have been the ground of decision in George v. Young, 45 La. Ann. 1232, 14 So. 137.\n The case, therefore, is within the limitation of the power of the state as laid down in Houck v. Little River Drainage Dist. supra, which cites Norwood v. Baker, \n172 U.S. 269\n, 43 L. ed. 443, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 187, and retains its principle. It has not the features which determined French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. \n181 U.S. 324\n, 45 L. ed. 879, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625, and the cases which have followed that case, and Phillip Wagner v. Leser [\n239 U.S. 207\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66], decided coincidently with Houck v. Little River Drainage Dist. and cited in the latter.\n It is to be remembered that a drainage district has the special purpose of the improvement of particular property, and when it is so formed to include property which is not and cannot be benefited directly or indirectly, including it only that it may pay for the benefit to other property, there is an abuse of power and an act of confiscation. Phillip Wagner v. Leser, supra. We are not dealing with motives alone, but as well with their resultant action; we are not dealing with disputable grounds of discretion or disputable degrees of benefit, but with an exercise of power determined by considerations not of the improvement of plaintiff's property, but solely of the improvement of the property of others,-power, therefore, arbitrarily exerted, imposing a burden without a compensating advantage of any kind.\n Therefore, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK CENT & H R R. CO. v. GRAY(1916)\nNo. 147\nArgued: December 17, 1915Decided: January 10, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. William Mann and Charles C. Paulding for plaintiff in error. \n\n[239 U.S. 583, 584]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Arthur W. Clement and Wilson E. Tipple for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n In the month of November, 1900, Charles P. Gray, the defendant in error, made an agreement with the representatives of the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Company, plaintiff in error, to make for the company a large map of the Vanderbilt Lines for the World's Fair, which was to take place at Buffalo in the following year. The price agreed to be paid him was $750, of which $150 was to be paid in cash and the balance in transportation to be used by defendant in error in traveling between New York city and his farm in Girard, Pennsylvania, following the lines of plaintiff in error between New York and Buffalo, and the line of another and independent railroad between that point and Girard. The map was made, delivered, and accepted, and the cash payment \n\n[239 U.S. 583, 585]\n\u00a0\n of $150 was made. At different times between the making of the contract and the month of September, 1906, defendant in error received from plaintiff in error transportation to the value of $55.77, applicable to this contract. In September, 1906, he called upon the company for transportation for himself and wife from New York city to Buffalo and return, intending to use it for a visit to the farm at Girard, Pennsylvania. The demand was refused, upon the ground that, because of the provisions of the interstate commerce law, the company could furnish no additional transportation on account of his services. A second demand of the same kind having been refused, defendant in error brought an action against plaintiff in error in the city court of the city of New York for the unpaid balance of the agreed price of the map, to which plaintiff in error set up the defense that by the terms of the Hepburn act of June 29, 1906 [34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563], it was unlawful to furnish transportation for any part of an interstate journey in payment for services or for any other consideration except a regular fare paid in money. The trial court, holding that this constituted no defense to the action, directed a verdict in favor of defendant in error for an amount made up by taking the agreed price of the map, deducting the cash payment and the amount paid in transportation, and adding interest to the balance. No particular question was or is made as to the quantum of recovery. The resulting judgment was affirmed by the appellate term of the supreme court, and its determination was affirmed by the appellate division of the supreme court for the first judicial department. Leave to appeal to the court of appeals of the state was denied, and this writ of error was sued out.\n Among the prohibitions contained in the act of June 29, 1906, is the following (34 Stat. at L. 587, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8569): 'Nor shall any carrier charge or demand or collect or receive a greater or less or different compensation for such transportation \n\n[239 U.S. 583, 586]\n\u00a0\n of passengers or property, or for any service in connection therewith, between the points named in such tariffs than the rates, fares, and charges which are specified in the tariff filed and in effect at the time; nor shall any carrier refund or remit in any manner or by any device any portion of the rates, fares, and charges so specified, nor extend to any shipper or person any privileges or facilities in the transportation of passengers or property, except such as are specified in such tariffs.' The reference, of course, is to common carriers by railroad in interstate commerce; and it is not questioned that plaintiff in error is within this category. The act took effect August 28, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 838, Res. 47).\n In Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 U.S. 467\n, 476, et seq., 55 L. ed. 297, 301, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 671, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265, it was held that the prohibition we have quoted prevented the exchange of transportation for services, advertising, releases, property, or anything else than money, and that this operated upon an agreement made long before the passage of the act, whereby the carrier, in consideration of a release of damages for injuries sustained by Mottley and his wife in consequence of a collision of trains upon the railroad, agreed to issue free passes to them, renewable annually during their several lives, the result being that after the taking effect of the Hepburn act specific performance of this agreement could no longer be required.\n That the prohibition applies with respect to transportation within the bounds of a state as part of an interstate journey is quite clear. Southern P. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 498, 527\n, 55 S. L. ed. 310, 320, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 279; Railroad Commission v. Worthington, \n225 \nU.S. 101, 110\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1004, 1008, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 653; Railroad Commission v. Texas & P. R. Co. \n229 \nU.S. 336, 340\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1215, 1218, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 837.\n In the present case, therefore, the railroad company acted strictly in accordance with the law when it refused any longer to furnish transportation to defendant in error in performance of the contract of November, 1900. \n\n[239 U.S. 583, 587]\n\u00a0\n but from this it by no means follows that it could refuse to make just compensation in money for the unpaid balance of the purchase price of the map. The judgment of the state court proceeded upon the ground that since the contract had been fully performed by Gray, so that the railroad company had received the entire benefit of it, and since the delivery of the particular consideration stipulated for had been prohibited by the act of Congress, the company thereupon became bound upon general principles of justice to pay him an equivalent in money for the balance of the consideration. In so holding the court was simply administering the applicable principles of state law, and did not run counter to the act of Congress. If the court had accorded legal efficacy to an executory contract made after the taking effect of the Hepburn act, and contrary to its provisions, a different question would be presented. But there is nothing in the act to prevent or relieve a carrier from paying in money for something of value which it had long before received under a contract valid when made, even though the contract provided for payment in transportation, which the passage of the act rendered thereafter illegal. In the Mottley Case, while the right to further ther specific performance of the contract for free passage was denied, the court said (\n219 U.S. 486\n ): 'Whether, without enforcing the contract in suit, the defendants in error may, by some form of proceeding against the railroad company, recover or restore the rights they had when the railroad collision occurred, is a question not before us, and we express no opinion on it.'\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK CENT. & H.

Baggage liability is limited to wearing apparel not to exceed one hundred (100) dollars in value for a whole ticket and fifty (50) dollars for a half ticket unless a greater value is declared by the owner, and excess charge thereon paid at the time of taking passage.' \n\n[242 U.S. 148, 150]\n\u00a0\n Immediately after purchasing the ticket she presented it at the baggage department; her trunk was received for transportation; and she accepted a check or receipt therefor upon which were the words: 'See conditions on back. Value not stated.' On the back this was printed: 'Notice to passengers. Baggage consists of a passenger's personal wearing apparel and liability is limited to $100 (except a greater or less amount is provided in tariffs) on full fare ticket, unless a greater value is declared by owner at time of checking and payment is made therefor.'\n The trunk and contents having been lost, she sued plaintiff in error for their full value in the circuit court, Jackson county, Missouri. Admitting responsibility for $100, the company claimed exemption from any larger recovery because of limitations specified in the ticket and impliedly assented to when it was accepted and used; and also because of the same limitations embodied in its tariff schedules filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n A jury being waived, the cause was tried by the court. Acceptance and use of both ticket and check were shown, and nothing in the evidence indicated any purpose to deceive or mislead the purchaser, or inability on her part to appreciate the provisions in question; she disclaimed having read them, and denied their validity under general principles of law. Counsel for the railroad offered in evidence copies of its tariff schedules on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission, certified by the chairman of that body. These contained clauses limiting liability for baggage to $100 unless greater value was declared and paid for; and they were admitted notwithstanding an objection to mode of their authentication.\n The circuit court held no agreement limiting liability resulted from acceptance and use of ticket and check, \n\n[242 U.S. 148, 151]\n\u00a0\n and that, 'even if the local and interstate tariffs of excess baggage rates introduced in evidence were filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission of the United States, and properly posted as required by the Interstate Commerce Act, still plaintiff would be entitled to recover the reasonable value of her trunk and the reasonable value of the articles of baggage contained therein, unless she expressly assented to the provisions of said tariffs limiting the liability of the defendant to $100 for loss of baggage unless a greater value should be declared and paid for.' A judgment for $1,771.52 was affirmed by the Kansas City court of appeals. It held that Boston & M. R. Co. v. Hooker, \n233 U.S. 97\n, 58 L. ed. 868, L. R.A.1915B, 450, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 526, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 593, would necessitate a reversal but for the fact that the record contained no competent evidence to show a schedule on file with the Commission specifying liability for baggage; 'the Federal statute provides that copies of tariff rates on file with that Commission shall be received in evidence, if certified by the secretary, under the seal of the Commission,' and certification by the chairman is insufficient. It therefore wholly disregarded the copies in the record and treated the cause as though they had not been introduced.\n The transactions in question related to interstate commerce; consequent rights and liabilities depend upon acts of Congress, agreement between the parties, and common-law principles accepted and enforced in Federal courts. And the carrier is entitled to the presumption that its business is being conducted lawfully. Southern Exp. Co. v. Byers, \n240 \nU.S. 612, 614\n, 60 S. L. ed. 825, 827, L.R.A.1917A, 197, 36 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 555.\n In the circumstances disclosed, acceptance and use of the ticket sufficed to establish an agreement prima facie valid which limited the carrier's liability. Mere failure by the passenger to read matter plainly placed before her \n\n[242 U.S. 148, 152]\n\u00a0\n could not overcome the presumption of assent. New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v.

St. Rep. 660, 27 N. E. 665.\n In order to determine the liability assumed for baggage it was proper to consider applicable tariff schedules on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission; and the carrier had a Federal right not only to a fair opportunity to put these in evidence, but also that, when before the court, they should be given due consideration. Southern Exp. Co. v. Byers, \n240 U.S. 614\n, 60 L. ed. 827, L.R.A.1917A, 197, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410; Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Jones, \n241 U.S. 181\n, 60 L. ed. 943, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 513. After their admission in evidence by the trial court the schedules could not be disregarded arbitrarily without denying the railroad's Federal right; and we think they were so treated by the court of appeals. We are cited to no decision of the supreme court of Missouri recognizing any settled rule of practice there which required such action, and the unjust consequences of it are apparent. Assuming, without deciding, the correctness of its opinion that the schedules as certified were inadmissible and improperly received, nevertheless the court should not have destroyed the carrier's opportunity to protect itself by introducing other evidence upon a new trial.\n Reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice Pitney dissents. \n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK LIFE INS. CO. v. DUNLEVY(1916)\nNo. 290\nArgued: Decided: June 5, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 518, 519]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James H. McIntosh, J. M. Mannon, Jr., Charles W. Willard, Warren Olney, Jr., and E. J. McCutchen for petitioner.\n Messrs. Nat Schmulowitz, Clarence Coonan, and Frank W. Taft for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n Respondent, Effie J. Gould Dunlevy, instituted this suit in the superior court, Marin county, California, January 14, 1910, against petitioner and Joseph W. Gould, her father, to recover $2,479.70, the surrender value of a policy on his life which she claimed had been assigned to her in 1893, and both were duly served with process while in that state. It was removed to the United States district court, February 16, 1910, and there tried by the judge in May, 1912, a jury having been expressly waived. Judgment for amount claimed was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 204 Fed. 670, 130 C. C. A. 473, 214 Fed. 1.\n The insurance company by an amended answer filed December 7, 1911, set up in defense (1) that no valid assignment had been made, and (2) that Mrs. Dunlevy was concluded by certain judicial proceedings in Pennsylvania wherein it had been garnished and the policy had been adjudged to be the property of Gould. Invalidity of the assignment is not now urged; but it is earnestly insisted that the Pennsylvania proceedings constituted a bar.\n In 1907 Boggs & Buhl recovered a valid personal judgment by default, after domiciliary service, against Mrs. Dunlevy, in the common pleas court at Pittsburgh, where she then resided. During 1909, 'the tontine dividend period' of the life policy having expired, the insurance \n\n[241 U.S. 518, 520]\n\u00a0\n company became liable for $2,479.70, and this sum was claimed both by Gould, a citizen of Pennsylvania, and his daughter, who had removed to California. In November, 1909, Boggs & Buhl caused issue of an execution attachment on their judgment, and both the insurance company and Gould were summoned as garnishees. He appeared, denied assignment of the policy, and claimed the full amount due thereon. On February 5, 1910,-after this suit was begun in California,-the company answered, admitted its indebtedness, set up the conflicting claims to the fund, and prayed to be advised as to its rights. At the same time it filed a petition asking for a rule upon the claimants to show cause why they should not interplead and thereby ascertain who was lawfully entitled to the proceeds, and, further, that it might be allowed to pay amount due into court for benefit of proper party. An order granted the requested rule, and directed that notice be given to Mrs. Dunlevy in California. This was done, but she made no answer and did not appear. Later the insurance company filed a second petition, and, upon leave obtained thereunder, paid $2,479.70 into court, March 21, 1910. All parties except Mrs. Dunlevy having appeared, a feigned issue was framed and tried to determine validity of alleged transfer of the policy. The jury found, October 1, 1910, there was no valid assignment, and thereupon, under an order of court, the fund was paid over to Gould.\n Beyond doubt, without the necessity of further personal service of process upon Mrs. Dunlevy, the court of common pleas at Pittsburgh had ample power through garnishment proceedings to inquire whether she held a valid claim against the insurance company, and, if found to exist, then to condemn and appropriate it so far as necessary to discharge the original judgment. Although herself outside the limits of the state, such disposition of the property would have been binding on her. Chicago, \n\n[241 U.S. 518, 521]\n\u00a0\n R. I. & P. R. Co. v.

See Brigham v. Fayerweather, 140 Mass. 411, 413, 5 N. E. 265. But the interpleader initiated by the company was an altogether different matter. This was an attempt to bring about a final and conclusive adjudication of her personal rights, not merely to discover property and apply it to debts. And unless in contemplation of law she was before the court, and required to respond to that issue, its orders and judgments in respect thereto were not binding on her. Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n, 24 L. ed. 565; Shinn, Attachment & Garnishment,  674. See Cross v. Armstrong, 44 Ohio St. 613, 623, 625, 10 N. E. 160.\n Counsel maintain that having been duly summoned in the original suit instituted by Boggs & Buhl in 1907, and notwithstanding entry of final judgment therein, 'Mrs. Dunlevy was in the Pennsylvania court and was bound by every order that court made, whether she remained within the jurisdiction of that court after it got jurisdiction over her person or not;' and hence, the argument is, 'When the company paid the money into court where she was, it was just the same in legal effect as if it had paid it to her.' This position is supposed to be supported by our opinion in Michigan Trust Co. v. Ferry, \n228 U.S. 346\n, 57 L. ed. 867, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 550, where it is said (p. 353): 'If a judicial proceeding is begun with jurisdiction over the person of the party concerned, it is within the power of a state to bind him by every subsequent order in the cause. Nations v. Johnson, 24 How. 195, 203, 204, 16 L. ed. 628, 631, 632. This is true not only of ordinary actions, but of proceedings like the present. It is within the power of a state to make the whole administration of the estate a single proceeding, to provide that one who has undertaken it within the jurisdiction shall be subject to the order of the court in the matter until the adminis- \n\n[241 U.S. 518, 522]\n\u00a0\n tration is closed by distribution, and, on the same principle, that he shall be required to account for and distribute all that he receives, by the order of the probate court.'\n Of course the language quoted had reference to the existing circumstances, and must be construed accordingly. The judgment under consideration was fairly within the reasonable anticipation of the executor when he submitted himself to the probate court. But a wholly different and intolerable condition would result from acceptance of the theory that, after final judgment, a defendant remains in court and subject to whatsoever orders may be entered under title of the cause. See Wetmore v. Karrick, \n205 \nU.S. 141, 151\n, 51 S. L. ed. 745, 748, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 434; Freeman, Judgm. 4th ed.  103. The interpleader proceedings were not essential concomitants of the original action by Boggs & Buhl against Dunlevy, but plainly collateral; and, when summoned to respond in that action, she was not required to anticipate them.

Former opinions of this court uphold validity of such proceedings upon the theory that jurisdiction to condemn is acquired by service of effective process upon the garnishee.\n The established general rule is that any personal judgment which a state court may render against one who did not voluntarily submit to its jurisdiction, and who is not a citizen of the state, nor served with process within its \n\n[241 U.S. 518, 523]\n\u00a0\n borders, no matter what the mode of service, is void, because the court had no jurisdiction over his person.

R. CO. v. PENINSULA PRODUCE EXCH. OF MARYLAND(1916)\nNo. 137\nArgued: Decided: January 24, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. Henry Wolf Bikle and Frederic D. McKenney for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[240 U.S. 34, 36]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James E. Ellegood for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n On May 26, 1910, the Peninsula Produce Exchange of Maryland delivered to the New York, Philadelphia, & Norfolk Railroad Company at Marion, Maryland, a carload of strawberries for transportation to New York city. The conditions of the transportation were set forth in the bill of lading issued by the railroad company. The property was delivered at destination some hours later than the customary time of arrival, and this action was brought to recover damages for the failure to transport and deliver with reasonable despatch. Judgment in favor of the shipper was affirmed by the court of appeals of Maryland. 122 Md. 215, 89 Atl. 433.\n The plaintiff in error, in its brief, states that 'the questions involved are two--'\n'1: Does the Carmack amendment [34 Stat. at L. 593, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8592] impose on the 'initial carrier' liability for delay occurring on the line of its connection without physical damage to the property?\n\n'2. Was the plaintiff entitled to recover because its shipment failed to arrive in time for the market of May 28th, when the regulations under which the shipment moved were published in tariffs duly on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and specifically provided: 'No carrier is bound to transport said property by any particular train or vessel, or in time for any particular market, or otherwise than with reasonable despatch, unless by specific agreement indorsed hereon'?'\n\n The first question, arising from the fact that it did not appear that the delay occurred on the line of the initial \n\n[240 U.S. 34, 37]\n\u00a0\n carrier (the defendant) was raised by an unsuccessful demurrer to the declaration, and both questions were presented by prayers for instructions which were denied.\n The amendment of  20 of the interstate commerce act, known as the Carmack amendment (act of June 29, 1906, chap. 3591,  7, 34 Stat. at L. 584, 595, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8592), provides 'that any common carrier . . . receiving property for transportation from a point in one state to a point in another state shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it or by any common carrier . . . to which such property may be delivered or over whose line or lines such property may pass, and no contract, receipt, rule, or regulation shall exempt such common carrier . . . from the liability hereby imposed.'\n We need not review at length the considerations which led to the adoption of this amendment. These were stated in Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, \n219 U.S. 186\n, 199-203, 55 L. ed. 167, 179-181, 31 L.R. A.(N.S.) 7, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164. It was there pointed out that along with singleness of rate and continuity of carriage in through shipments there had grown up the practice of requiring specific stipulations limiting the liability of each separate company to its own part of the through route, and, as a result, the shipper could look to the initial carrier for recompense only 'for loss, damage, or delay' occurring on its own line. This 'burdensome situation' was 'the matter which Congress undertook to regulate.' And it was concluded that the requirement that interstate carriers holding themselves out as receiving packages for destinations beyond their own terminal should be compelled 'as a condition of continuing in that traffic to obligate themselves to carry to the point of destination, using the lines of connecting carriers as their own agencies,' was within the power of Congress. The rule, said the court in defining the purpose of the Carmack amendment, 'is adapted to \n\n[240 U.S. 34, 38]\n\u00a0\n secure the rights of the shipper by securing unity of transportation with unity of responsibility.' And, again, we said in Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 57 L. ed. 314, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148, that this legislation embraces 'the subject of the liability of the carrier under a bill of lading which he must issue.' 'The duty to issue a bill of lading and the liability thereby assumed are covered in full, and though there is no reference to the effect upon state regulation, it is evident that Congress intended to adopt a uniform rule and relieve such contracts from the diverse regulation to which they had been theretofore subject.' Id. p. 506.\n It is now insisted that Congress failed to accomplish this paramount object; that while unity of responsibility was secured if the goods were injured in the course of transportation or were not delivered, the statute did not reach the case of a failure to transport with reasonable despatch. In such case it is said that, although there is a through shipment, the shipper must still look to the particular carrier whose neglect caused the delay. We do not think that the language of the amendment has the inadequacy attributed to it. The words 'any loss, damage, or injury to such property,' caused by the initial carrier or by any connecting carrier, are comprehensive enough to embrace all damages resulting from any failure to discharge a carrier's duty with respect to any part of the transportation to the agreed destination. It is not necessary, nor is it natural, in view of the general purpose of the statute, to take the words 'to the property' as limiting the word 'damage' as well as the word 'injury,' jury,' and thus as rendering the former wholly superfluous. It is said that there is a different responsibility on the part of the carrier with respect to delay from that which exists where there is a failure to carry safely. But the difference is with respect to the measure of the carrier's obligation; the duty to transport with reasonable despatch is none the less an integral part of the normal undertaking of \n\n[240 U.S. 34, 39]\n\u00a0\n the carrier. And we can gather no intent to unify only a portion of the carrier's responsibility. Further, it is urged that the amendment provides that the initial carrier may recover from the connecting carrier 'on whose line the loss, damage, or injury shall have been sustained the amount of such loss, damage, or injury as it may be required to pay to the owners of such property;' and this, it is said, shows that the 'loss, damage, or injury' described is that which may be localized as having occurred on the line of one of the carriers, and therefore should be limited to physical loss or injury. But we find no difficulty in this, as the damages required to be paid by the initial carrier are manifestly regarded as resulting from some breach of duty, and the purpose is simply to provide for a recovery against the connecting carrier if the latter, as to its part of the transportation, is found to be guilty of that breach. The view we have expressed finds support in the explicit terms of the act of January 20, 1914, chap. 11, 38 Stat. at L. 278, which provides 'that no suit brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction against a railroad company . . . to recover damages for delay, loss of, or injury to property received for transportation by such common carrier under section twenty of the act to regulate commerce . . . shall be removed to any court of the United States where the matter in controversy does not exceed, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000.' If the language of  20 can be regarded as ambiguous, this legislative interpretation of it as conferring a right of action for delay, as well as for loss or injury to the property in the course of transportation, is entitled to great weight. 1 Alexander \n\n[240 U.S. 34, 40]\n\u00a0\n v. Alexandria, 5 Cranch, 1, 7, 8, 3 L. ed. 19-21; United States v. Freeman, 3 How. 556, 564, 565, 11 L. ed. 724, 727, 728; Cope v. Cope, \n137 \nU.S. 682, 688\n, 34 S. L. ed. 832, 834, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222.\n The second question, as stated, is sought to be raised under the stipulation of the bill of lading (being one of the conditions filed with the tariffs under the interstate commerce act) that the carrier is not bound to transport 'by any particular train or vessel, or in time for any particular market, or otherwise than with reasonable despatch.' See Chicago & A. R. Co. v. Kirby, \n225 U.S. 155\n, 56 L. ed. 1033, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 501; Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Robinson, \n233 U.S. 173\n, 58 L. ed. 901, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 556. But the argument upon this point is not addressed to the issue, as recovery was not sought or permitted, except for a failure to transport with reasonable despatch. The declaration alleged that the berries 'were to be transported with safety, and with reasonable despatch, and delivered . . . in safe condition and with reasonable diligence;' that the defendant, or its connecting lines, did not 'transport or deliver the same with reasonable despatch;' and that the damage was due to their failure to use 'due and reasonable diligence.' The court instructed the jury that it became the duty of the defendant and all connecting lines 'to use reasonable care, diligence, and exertion in forwarding and transporting and delivering' the berries, and that if the jury should believe that the defendant and the connecting lines, or any of them, 'did not use such care, diligence, and exertion,' and that by reason of the failure so to do the berries arrived 'too late for the market of the day on which they would have arrived if they had been forwarded and transported with such care, diligence, and exertion, and that the plaintiff thereby sustained loss, then their verdict should be for the plaintiff.' As the court of appeals of Maryland said, the ground of the \n\n[240 U.S. 34, 41]\n\u00a0\n action was 'the failure to carry with reasonable despatch, and the loss of marketability is mentioned as the element of damage.' That is, the reference to the market said to have been lost was merely for the purpose of calculating damages which were sought solely because of lack of reasonable diligence, and not upon the allegation of any added duty with respect to a particular train or market. The stipulation invoked does not attempt to limit the duty of the carrier to transport with reasonable despatch, and we are not called upon to consider its effect in any other aspect.\n The instructions, however, permitted the jury to award as damages the amount of the decline in value, due to the delay, at the place of destination, without stating the limitation set forth in the tariff of the plaintiff in error as filed; and this tariff, with the accompanying conditions, duly offered in evidence, was excluded. It was conceded by the court of appeals that these rulings were erroneous, but the court found that they worked no harm to the plaintiff in error. The condition in the bill of lading and in the filed tariff provided that 'the amount of any loss or damage for which any carrier is liable shall be computed on the basis of the value of the property (being the bona fide invoice price, if any, to the consignee, including the freight charges, if prepaid) at the place and time of shipment under this bill of lading, unless a lower value has been represented in writing by the shipper or has been agreed upon or is determined by the classiflcation or tariffs upon which the rate is based, in any of which events such lower value shall be the maximum amount to govern such computation, whether or not such loss or damage occurs from negligence.' Treating the rate charged for the transportation as based upon assent to this provision, the court of appeals construed the stipulation not as changing the basis of liability, but as limiting the amount of the recovery in any event to the value of the property \n\n[240 U.S. 34, 42]\n\u00a0\n at the time and place of shipment, no other value having been agreed upon. Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 57 L. ed. 314, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148; Wells, F. & Co. v. Neiman-Marcus Co. \n227 U.S. 469\n, 57 L. ed. 600, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 267; Boston & M. R. Co. v. Hooker, \n233 U.S. 97\n, 58 L. ed. 868, L.R.A.1915B, 450, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 593; George N. Pierce Co. v. Wells, F. & Co. \n236 U.S. 278\n, 59 L. ed. 576, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 351. It appeared from the evidence that the berries were sold in New York city at an average price of 6 1\/2 cents a quart. It was also proved that the decline in value due to the delay was from 2 to 3 cents a quart. The jury gave a verdict for $180.48, which included $153.60, principal, and $26.88 interest. That is, the jury gave damages at the rate of 2 cents a quart for the 240 crates (7,680 quarts) shipped. The court held that it could not be said, as the defendant contended, that there was no proof of actual damage from the delay; and that, so far as the maximum liability fixed by the filed tariff was concerned, the court was justified in taking the value of the berries at the time and place of shipment as being at least equal to the 2 cents a quart allowed. Upon this point the court of appeals said: 'It may be judicially assumed that their value at the time and place of shipment was at least equal to the 2 cents per quart which the jury allowed as damages, and in the view we have taken of the case no just purpose would be served in reversing the judgment and subjecting the parties to the expense of a new trial.' That is to say, upon the facts as the state court found them to be, the agreed maximum of liability as stipulated was not exceeded.\n We cannot say, in the light of the evidence, that the state court denied to the plaintiff in error any Federal right in holding as it did with respect to the amount of the value of the berries at the time and place of shipment, and in this view we are unable to conclude that, in disposing of the Federal questions, there was any error which would require, or justify, a reversal.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The language of the Carmack amendment has been construed in various decisions by state courts as embracing damages for delay.

Bunn for petitioner.\n Messrs. Govnor Teats, Leo Teats, and Ralph Teats for respondents.\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 614, 617]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n Benjamin Meese, an employee of the Seattle Brewing & Malting Company, was fatally injured on April 12, 1913, while engaged about his ordinary duties at its plant in Seattle. Alleging that his death resulted from the negligence of the petitioner railway company, his wife and children brought this action for damages in the district court of the United States. They relied upon the following sections, Remington & Ballinger's Annotated Codes and Statutes of Washington:\n'Section 183. . . . When the death of a person is caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another, his heirs or personal representatives may maintain an action for damages against the person causing the death.'\n\n'Section 194. No action for a personal injury to any person occasioning his death shall abate, nor shall such right of action determine, by reason of such death, if he have a wife or child living , . . .; but such action may be prosecuted, or commenced and prosecuted, in favor of such wife or in favor of the wife and children. . . .'\n\n The railway company demurred, specifying as one of the grounds therefor: 'That there is no authority in law under which the plaintiffs' action can be maintained as against this answering defendant, it appearing from the complaint that Benjamin Meese, on account of whose wrongful death this action was brought, sustained the injuries \n\n[239 U.S. 614, 618]\n\u00a0\n of which complaint is made, at the place of work and plant of his employer, and that plaintiffs' claim comes within the terms of chapter 74 of the Session Laws of the state of Washington for 1911, being an act relating to compensation of injured workmen,' approved March 14, 1911\n\n\n By the act referred to the legislature of Washington specifically repealed certain sections of Remington & Ballinger's Code, not including  183 and 194; established a comprehensive plan for the relief of workmen injured in extrahazardous work, and their families and dependents, regardless of the question of fault; and likewise made provision for raising the necessary funds by enforced contributions from specified employers, both breweries and railroads being included.\n The trial court (206 Fed. 222) held that the purpose of the act of March 14, 1911, was not merely to end controversies between employers and employees in respect of injuries to the latter, but to end all suits at law for the injury or death of employees while engaged in certain occupations, no matter by whom injured or killed, with certain exceptions not here important. And by a judgment dated July 11, 1913, the demurrer was accordingly sustained and the complaint dismissed.\n This action of the trial court was reversed by the circuit court of appeals (127 C. C. A. 622, 211 Fed. 254, 4 N. C. C. A. 819), the latter being of opinion that the act in question did not, and was not intended to, deprive complainants of their right to proceed under  183 and 194 of the Code, since deceased was not its employee when the accident occurred. Counsel for the railway called especial attention to Peet v. Mills, 76 Wash. 437, L. R. A. 1916A, 358, 136 Pac. 685, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 154, 4 N. C. C. A. 786, decided November 28, 1913, and insisted that the conclusions there announced were in accord with the opinion and judgment of the district court then under review; but the circuit court of appeals rejected this view, saying: 'We are unable to agree \n\n[239 U.S. 614, 619]\n\u00a0\n with counsel that the supreme court of the state of Washington in that case reached a conclusion different from that reached by us in the present case.'\n The error now assigned and relied on is: 'That the circuit court of appeals should have followed Peet v. Mills, and have affirmed the judgment of the district court.'\n It is settled doctrine that Federal courts must accept the construction of a state statute deliberately adopted by its highest court. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Omaha, \n230 \nU.S. 100, 116\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1410, 1416, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 967; Fairfield v. Gallatin County, \n100 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 25 S. L. ed. 544, 546. The supreme court of Washington in Peet v. Mills construed the statute in question, and we think its opinion plainly supports the holding of the district court and is in direct opposition to the conclusion reached by the circuit court of appeals. The following excerpts from the opinion will suffice to indicate its import:\n'By this appeal, we are again called upon to review the workmen's compensation act of 1911 (Laws 1911, chap. 74, p. 345, 3 Rem. & Bal. Code ,  6604-1 et seq.), under appellant's contention that the act is applicable only where recovery is sought upon the ground of negligence of the employer. . . .\n\n'. . . The conclusion is evident that, in the enactment of this new law, the legislature declared it to be the policy of this state that every hazardous industry within the purview of the act should bear the burden arising out of injuries to its employees; and that it was the further policy of the state to do away with the recognized evils attaching to the remedies under existing forms of law and to substitute a new remedy that should be ample, full, and complete, reaching every injury sustained by any workman while employed in any such industry, regardless of the cause of the injury or the negligence to which it might be attributed. We can conceive of no language the legislature might have employed that would make its purpose and intent more ascertainable than that made use of in the 1st section of the act. To say with \n\n[239 U.S. 614, 620]\n\u00a0\n appellant that the intent of the act is limited to the abolishment of negligence as a ground of action against an employer only is to overlook and read out of the act and its declaration of principles the economic thought sought to be crystallized into law,-that the industry itself was the primal cause of the injury, and, as such, should be made to bear its burdens. . . . That in so doing the legislative mind was intent upon the abolishment of all causes of action that may have theretofore existed, irrespective of the persons in favor of whom or against whom such right might have existed, is equally clear from the language of  5 of the act, containing a schedule of awards, and providing that each workman injured in the course of his employment should receive certain compensation, and 'such payment shall be in lieu of any and all rights of action whatsoever against any person whomsoever.' . . . For these reasons we are of the opinion that the compensation provided by the act in case of injury to any workman in any hazardous occupation was intended to be exclusive of every other remedy, and that all causes of action theretofore existing, except as they are saved by the provisos of the act, are done away with.'\n\n Respondents' suggestion that the construction of the act adopted by the trial court would cause it to conflict with the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment is without merit. They have raised no other question involving application of the Federal Constitution.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and the action of the District Court affirmed.\n And it is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McKenna is of opinion that the statute was properly construed by the circuit court of apppeals, and that its conclusions do not conflict with the opinion of the state supreme court. He therefore dissents. \n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN PAC. RY. CO. v. WALL(1916)\nNo. 350\nArgued: December 1, 1915Decided: April 24, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 87, 88]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles Donnelly for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Thomas J. Walsh and Walter Aitken for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action to recover for injuries to cattle being transported in interstate commerce, the gravamen of the complaint being that the cattle were unreasonably delayed in transit, and consequently were greatly reduced in weight and emaciated in appearance.\n The cattle were shipped in January, 1912, from Belgrade, Montana, to the Union Stock Yards at Chicago over two connecting railroads,-the Northern Pacific and the Burlington,-under a through bill of lading issued by the initial carrier. The shipment was at a reduced rate based upon the stipulations in the bill of lading. The rate and the bill of lading had been regularly established and put in force under the interstate commerce act and its amendments. One stipulation was to the effect that the shipper, as a condition precedent to his right to recover for any injury to the cattle while in transit, should give notice in writing of his claim to some officer or station agent 'of said company' before the cattle were removed from the place of destination or mingled with other stock; and another was to the effect that the terms of the bill of lading should inure to the benefit of any connecting carrier over whose line the cattle should \n\n[241 U.S. 87, 89]\n\u00a0\n pass in the course of their transportation. By an indorsement on the bill of lading the Burlington Company was designated as the connecting carrier. The shipment was accompanied by an attendant selected by the shipper and authorized to represent him in all matters pertaining to the general care and handling of the cattle. Upon reaching their destination the cattle were delivered by the Burlington Company to an agent of the shipper, and were sold, removed, and mingled with other stock before any notice was given of a claim for injury to them while in transit.\n This action was brought against the initial carrier,-the Northern Pacific Company,-and the damages sought were for alleged injuries to the cattle while passing over both roads. In its answer the defendant set up the stipulations before named; insisted that they were established under the interstate commerce act, and that a Montana statute invalidating such stipulations was, as applied to bills of lading in interstate commerce, in conflict with the congressional enactment and void; alleged that no notice of any claim for injury to the cattle had been given 'to any officer or station agent of the defendant, or to any officer or station agent of the connecting carrier,' until after the cattle had been removed from the place of destination and mingled with other stock, and claimed that by reason of the failure to give the stipulated notice the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. In his reply the plaintiff, while expressly admitting that he had not complied with the stipulation relating to notice, denied that it was established or effective under the interstate commerce act, insisted that it was unreasonable and in contravention of the Montana statute, alleged that compliance with the stipulation had been waived by the defendant, and set forth at length and invoked the Carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act in support of the effort to recover from the initial carrier \n\n[241 U.S. 87, 90]\n\u00a0\n for the injuries occurring while the cattle were on the line of the connecting earrier. Upon the trial, and after the evidence was concluded, the defendant moved for a directed verdict in its favor upon the ground that the contract embodied in the bill of lading was valid, that confessedly the notice 'required by the contract' was not given, and that there was no evidence showing a waiver of the notice. The motion was denied upon the ground that, under the evidence, the question of waiver was for the jury, and an exception was reserved by the defendant. At its request the court, in charging the jury, said: 'One of the defenses relied upon by the defendant is that no notice of claim for damages for loss or injury to the stock in question was given by the plaintiff to the defendant or to the connecting carrier, before the stock was removed from the place of destination or mingled with other stock. This provision of said contract is a reasonable one, binding upon the plaintiff, and, under the admissions in his reply, prevents him from recovering in this action, unless you find that . . . defendant expressly or impliedly by its conduct waived the giving of said notice in accordance with this provision of the contract.' The jury, evidently resolving the question of waiver against the defendant, returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the judgment thereon was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 50 Mont. 122, 145 Pac. 291.\n From what has been said it is apparent not only that the damages sought were for injuries occurring while the cattle were being transported in interstate commerce, but also that both parties relied upon the interstate commerce act and its amendments,-the plaintiff to sustain his right to recover for the injuries on the line of the connecting carrier, and the defendant to sustain its defense based upon the stipulations in the bill of lading. And it is plain that the trial court gave controlling effect to that act and its amendments, for otherwise the instruc- \n\n[241 U.S. 87, 91]\n\u00a0\n tion upholding the validity of the stipulation for notice could not have been given, in the presence of the Montana statute (Laws 1909, chap. 138) declaring such a stipulation void.\n The supreme court, passing the question whether notice had been waived, interpreted the stipulation as requiring that the notice be given to an officer or station agent primarily employed by the Northern Pacific Company, and thereby excluding notice to an officer or station agent of the Burlington Company, and then held the stipulation unreasonable and inoperative because no officer or agent primarily employed by the Northern Pacific Company was accessible at the place of destination. Whether in so interpreting the stipulation that court gave proper effect to the interstate commerce act and its amendments is the Federal question pressed upon our attention, and we think it is fairly presented by the record. The shipment being interstate, that legislation was controlling; the through bill of lading was issued under it; the pleadings show that its application was invoked; and in the answer, as also in the instruction given at the defendant's request, there was a distinct assertion that notice was not given 'to any officer or station agent of the defendant, or to any officer or station agent of the connecting carrier,' which meant that the defendant was proceeding upon the theory that the stipulation, when read in connection with the Carmack amendment, contemplated and recognized that notice to an officer or agent of the connecting carrier- the Burlington Company-would suffice.\n As this court often has held, the laws in force at the time and place of the making of a contract, and which affect its validity, performance, and enforcement, enter into and form a part of it, as if they were expressly referred to or incorporated in its Von Hoffman v. Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, 550, 18 L. ed. 408, 409; Walker v. Whitehead, 16 Wall. 314, 317, 21 L. ed. 357, 358; Ed- \n\n[241 U.S. 87, 92]\n\u00a0\n wards v. Kearzey, \n96 \nU.S. 595, 601\n, 24 S. L. ed. 793, 796. A bill of lading is a contract and within this rule. The Carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act ( 7, chap. 3591, 34 Stat. at L. 584, 595, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563, 8592), which was in force when this bill of lading was issued, directs a carrier receiving property for interstate transportation to issue a through bill of lading therefor, although the place of destination is on the line of another carrier; subjects the receiving carrier to liability for any injury to the property caused by it or any other carrier in the course of the transportation, and requires a connecting carrier on whose line the property is injured to reimburse the receiving carrier where the latter is made to pay for such injury. Thus, under the operation of the amendment, the connecting carrier becomes the agent of the receiving carrier for the purpose of completing the transportation and delivering the property. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, \n219 \nU.S. 186, 196\n, 206 S., 55 L. ed. 167, 178, 182, 31 L.R. A.(N.S.) 7, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164; Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Wallace, \n223 \nU.S. 481, 491\n, 56 S. L. ed 516, 523, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 205. This bill of lading was issued under that statute and should be interpreted in the light of it. Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Dettlebach, \n239 \nU.S. 588, 593\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 177. The shipment was to pass over both roads in reaching its destination; the delivery at that place was to be made, as in fact it was, by an officer or station agent of the connecting carrier; and the stipulated notice was to be given before the cattle were removed from the place of destination or mingled with other stock; that is, while it was yet possible from an inspection of them to ascertain whether the claim of injury, if any, was well founded. In these circumstances it seems plain that the stipulation meant and contemplated that the notice might be given at the place of destination to an officer or station agent of the connecting carrier, and that notice to it, in view of its relation to the initial carrier, should operate as notice to the latter. This interpretation treats the stipulation as designed to be fair to both shipper and carrier, permits it to serve a useful purpose, and gives \n\n[241 U.S. 87, 93]\n\u00a0\n due effect to the statute under which it was issued. True, the words 'said company' in the stipulation, if read only in connection with an introductory sentence in the bill of lading, would seem to refer to the initial carrier alone, but when they are read in connection with the statute and other parts of the bill of lading, including the provision that its terms and conditions 'shall inure to the benefit of' any connecting carrier, it is apparent that they embrace the carrier making the delivery as well as the initial carrier, especially as the former is, in legal contemplation, the agent of the latter.\n The act of March 4, 1915, chap. 176, 38 Stat. at L. 1196, altering the terms of the Carmack amendment, is without present bearing, because passed long after this shipment was made.\n We are of opinion that the Supreme Court of the State failed to give proper effect to the Carmack amendment in interpreting the bill of lading, and that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds, dissenting:\n For two reasons I am unable to agree with the opinion of the court.\n First. If reiteration can establish a rule of law, it must be taken as settled that in causes coming here by writs of error from state courts of last resort we may not consider Federal questions not specially set up below. And further, that such a question comes too late if raised for the first time after final decision in the highest state court by petition for rehearing unless this was actually entertained.

Rep. 146. \n\n[241 U.S. 87, 94]\n\u00a0\n The following recitals are parts of the bill of lading:\n Par. 6. 'The said shipper further agrees that as a condition precedent to his right to recover any damages for loss or injury to any of said stock, he will give notice in writing of his claim therefor to some officer or station agent of the said company before said stock has been removed from the place of destination or mingled with other stock.'\n Par. 9. 'The terms, conditions and limitations hereby imposed shall inure to the benefit of each and every carrier, beyond the route of said company, to which the said property may come for purpose of transportation.'\n A rehearing was denied by the supreme court of Montana in this brief order: 'Appellant's motion for a rehearing herein heretofore submitted is after due consideration by the court denied.' An elaborate written argument filed there in support of the petition, and incorporated in the record, states:\n'Appellant did not brief nor argue the reasonableness of the provisions of paragraph 6 of said contract from the view point considered by the court on page 3 to line 5 of page 7 of the opinion, for the reason that no such question was raised by the plaintiff in the court below. In fact, the only grounds upon which the plaintiff attacked said provisions of the contract in his answer was that it 'is unreasonable, unjust, burdensome, against the policy of the law, and contrary to the express provisions of chapter 138 of Session Laws of the state of Montana for 1909.' Not until his brief was filed in this court did such question appear in the case.\n\n'In view of the provision of paragraph 9 of the contract, also of plaintiff's position in the court below, and of the fact that the defendant company has always considered that a notice served upon 'some officer or station agent' of the connecting carrier at point of delivery, in the manner required by paragraph 6 of the contract, was a sufficient \n\n[241 U.S. 87, 95]\n\u00a0\n notice to show a compliance with such provision in an action brought against the initial carrier, we did not consider the question as presented for the first time in respondent's brief of any importance, and did not even reply thereto in our oral argument.\n\n'Under section 9 of said contract the terms and conditions thereof inure to the benefit of the connecting carrier. Therefore, such notice should be given to some officer or station agent of such carrier at point of delivery when damages are claimed.\n\n'The importance of this is apparent when considered in connection with the Carmack amendment to the interstate commerce law.'\n\n The only ground for reversal now seriously relied upon is that the Carmack amendment ( 7, chap. 3591, 34 Stat. at L. 584, 595, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563, 8592) made 'the connecting carrier, and therefore its agents, the agents of the initial carrier,' and consequently the court below wrongly held, because no officer or station agent primarily employed by Northern Pacific Railway was shown to have been in Chicago, paragraph 6 was unreasonable and inoperative, and notice to a Burlington agent would not have been effective for any purpose. I fail to find that this point was definitely raised at any stage prior to the application for rehearing; and counsel for the railroad below seem to have been equally unsuccessful. If they had already wittingly relied upon it, they would hardly have burdened their argument for rehearing with an excuse for failure so to do. Former opinions imperatively demand that the foundation for our jurisdiction be laid in plain view, and not around a corner, where only an esoteric eye can detect it. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v.

'The bill of lading itself is an elaborate document, bearing on its face evidences of care and deliberation in the formation of the conditions of the liability of the companies issuing it. The language is chosen by the com- \n\n[241 U.S. 87, 96]\n\u00a0\n panies for the purpose, among others, of limiting and diminishing their common-law liabilities, and if there be any doubt arising from the language used as to its proper meaning or construction, the words should be construed most strongly against the companies, because their officers or agents prepared the instrument, and as the court is to interpret such language, it is, as stated by Mr. Justice Harlan, in delivering the opinion of the court in First Nat. Bank v. Hartford F. Ins. Co. \n95 \nU.S. 673, 679\n, 24 S. L. ed. 563, 565: 'Both reasonable and just that its own words should be construed most strongly against itself.\" Texas & P. R. Co. v. Reiss, \n183 \nU.S. 621, 626\n, 46 S. L. ed. 358, 360, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 252.\n Apparently the bill under consideration followed a form adopted before passage of the Carmack amendment, or at least before this was adequately understood. It is dated, 'Belgrade, Montana, Station, January 2, 1912,' purports to be an 'agreement, made the day above stated between the Northern Pacific Railway Company, hereinafter called the 'Company,' and R. J. Wall, hereinafter called the 'Shipper,\" and contains, in addition to paragraphs 6 and 9, copied above, the following ones:\n Par. 7. 'It is further agreed and provided that no suit or action to recover any damages for loss or injury to any of said stock, or for the recovery of any claim by virtue of this contract, shall be sustained by any court against said Company unless suit or action shall be commenced within sixty (60) days after the damage shall occur, and on any suit or action commenced against said Company after the expiration of said sixty ( 60) days, the lapse of time shall be taken and deemed conclusive evidence against the validity of said claim, any statute to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n Par. 8. 'The said Company shall not be liable for the nondelivery or loss of, nor for injuries suffered by, any of the stock beyond the line of its own railroad.' \n\n[241 U.S. 87, 97]\n\u00a0\n Commenting on paragraph 6, the supreme court of Montana said (50 Mont. 127):\n'If the paragraph above means anything, it required the shipper to give notice in writing to an officer or station agent of the Northern Pacific Company. Notice to an agent of the Burlington road would not have been effective for any purpose. The Company mentioned in paragraph 6 is defined by the preamble to the contract, to mean the 'Northern Pacific Railway Company.' Furthermore, if this provision is valid, it must be so construed as to serve some purpose. Its evident purpose was to enable the carrier to investigate the condition of the stock, and to that end the shipper was required to keep them separate until such investigation was made or a reasonable time therefor had elapsed. By the facts before us the reasonableness of the provision is to be tested. The contract is silent upon the question of service of the notice. If personal service was necessary, the shipper was required to hold the cattle at the Union Stock Yards until he could find an officer or station agent of the Northern Pacific Company. No particular officer or station agent is designated, and if this provision is to be taken literally, the shipper was required at his peril to assume the burden of finding some person who answered the description given. There is not a suggestion in the contract, in the pleadings, or the proof, that the Northern Pacific Company had an officer or station agent at Chicago, or nearer than St. Paul, the eastern terminus of its road-more than 400 miles away. If service could have been made by mail, plaintiff would have been in no better position, though doubtless a letter written to the station agent at Belgrade, and mailed postpaid at Chicago, would have sufficed for a literal compliance with the terms of this provision. But in any event, plaintiff would have had to bear the burden of keeping his cattle on the cars or in the stock yards until the notice had been received and a reasonable time for inspection \n\n[241 U.S. 87, 98]\n\u00a0\n had elapsed. If the paragraph in question be construed to mean that a written notice mailed from Chicago to any station agent of the Northern Pacific Company, even the agent at Seattle, would suffice, it is senseless. If it is construed to mean that the shipper should travel from Chicago to St. Paul, and make personal service of the notice upon an officer or station agent of the Northern Pacific Company, then it is unreasonable to the point of being unconscionable. Whether the company had an officer or station agent at Chicago,-at a point where it has no road,-upon whom service of this notice could have been made, was a matter peculiarly within its own knowledge, and for this reason the burden was upon it to make proof of such fact.'\n\n Manifestly its language has given rise to a very grave doubt; therefore I think the contract should be construed most strongly against the company and with a view to preserve shipper's rights. The construction placed upon paragraph 6 by the state supreme court, when sitting within surroundings designed to stimulate clear thinking, is diametrically opposed to the one now adopted. In such circumstances it appears to me hardly reasonable to say that a stockman at a wayside Montana station was bound instantly to apprehend the true interpretation, notwithstanding any mental quickening which he may have received from a 'rough wind' and a modest thermometer pointing to only '7 or 8 degrees below zero.'\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice McKenna concurs in this dissent for the second reason stated. \n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHWESTERN LAUNDRY v.

To that end the ordinance authorized the appointment of a smoke inspector, and otherwise dealt with the subject with a view to effecting the prohibited purpose declared. The case was heard upon the bill and a motion practically amounting to a demurrer.\n The bill and amended bill are very lengthy. For our purposes, their allegations and the requirements of the ordinance sufficiently appear in what is said in the discussion and disposition of the case.\n The protection of the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment is invoked. It is insisted that the ordinance is void because its standard of efficiency requires the remodeling of practically all furnaces which were in existence at the time of its adoption; it forbids remodeling or substituted equipment without a prescribed license; it forbids new construction without such license; it fails to specify approved equipment, and instead delegates, first to the inspector, and second, to the smoke abatement commission, the unregulated discretion to arbitrarily prescribe the requirements in each case, without reference to any other as to the required character of smoke prevention device, thus making the right of complainants and their class to own and operate such furnaces subject to the pleasure of the inspector and commission. It is averred that the ordinance exceeds the authority delegated to the city by the legislature; that it attempts to substitute its own definition of the crime and nuisance committed by the emission of dense smoke for that enacted by the legislature in the act under the pretended authority of which the ordinance is adopted; that it is unreasonable and tyrannical and exceeds the authority delegated for want of uniformity as to the whole city and because the exceptions specified are not natural and just. It is alleged that the ordinance prescribes arbitrary tests of degrees of density, and enables the inspector to present irrebutta- \n\n[239 U.S. 486, 491]\n\u00a0\n ble proof of violation; that it provides for unlimited prosecutions and successive fines, constituting excessive punishment in the aggregate, without adequate remedy or relief, and undertakes to deprive the courts of power to determine whether the nuisances have in fact been committed or maintained.\n A motion to dismiss the bill covered three grounds: First, that the bill did not state any matter of equity entitling complainants to the relief prayed, nor were the facts, as stated in the bill, sufficient to entitle complainants to any relief against defendants; second, that the bill showed upon its face that the complainants have a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law; and third, as it appeared on the face of the bill that the complainants were all residents of the state of Iowa, and the relief demanded was against an ordinance of the defendant city, the court was without jurisdiction. The court sustained the motion, and entered a final decree dismissing the bill with prejudice. There was no attempt to make a separate issue on the question of jurisdiction, or to take an appeal upon that question alone to this court. Judicial Code,  238, 36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1215\n\n\n The decree was a general one on the merits, and, as the bill charged a violation of the 14th Amendment not so frivolous as to fail to give original jurisdiction, the appeal to this court from the final decree brings the whole case here.

Rep. 997.\n We are not furnished with any reference to an Iowa statute giving an adequate remedy at law, and we find none such. We have therefore to deal with the questions, Federal and state, made upon the face of the bill.\n So far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, we have no doubt the state may by itself, or through authorized municipalities, declare the emission of dense smoke in \n\n[239 U.S. 486, 492]\n\u00a0\n cities or populous neighborhoods a nuisance and subject to restraint as such; and that the harshness of such legislation, or its effect upon business interests, short of a merely arbitrary enactment, are not valid constitutional objections. Nor is there any valid Federal constitutional objection in the fact that the regulation may require the discontinuance of the use of property, or subject the occupant to large expense in complying with the terms of the law or ordinance. Recent cases in this court are Reinman v. Little Rock, \n237 U.S. 171\n, 59 L. ed. 900, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 511; Chicago & A. R. Co. v. Tranberger, \n238 U.S. 67\n, 59 L. ed. 1204, 35 Sup. Ct.

McGill v. Pintsch Compressing Co. 140 Iowa, 429, 20 L.R.A.(N.S.) 466, 118 N. W. 786.\n It is contended that the ordinance is in excess of the legislative authority conferred by the state of Iowa upon the city of Des Moines. This question does not seem to have been directly passed upon by the supreme court of Iowa.\n The statute of Iowa enacted April 15th, 1911, before the passage of this ordinance, is as follows:\n An Act Declaring the Emission of Smoke within the Corporate Limits of Certain Cities to be a Public Nuisance, and Conferring upon Such Cities Additional Powers for the Abatement of Such Nuisances. . . .\n Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Iowa:\n Section 1. Declared a nuisance.-The emission of dense smoke within the corporate limits of any of the \n\n[239 U.S. 486, 493]\n\u00a0\n cities of this state now or hereafter having a population of sixty-five thousand (65,000) inhabitants or over, including cities acting under the commission plan of government is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.\n Section 2. Abatement.-Every such city is hereby empowered to provide by ordinance for the abatement of such nuisance either by fine or imprisonment or by action in the district court of the county in which such city is located, or by both, such action to be prosecuted in the name of the city. They may also by ordinance provide all necessary rules and regulations for smoke inspection and the abatement and prevention of the smoke nuisance. 34 Laws of Iowa, chap. 37, p. 27.\n The ordinance in question was passed on the 6th day of September, 1911, and became effective, as we have said, on that date. The city of Des Moines is within the terms of this act. On March 20th, 1913, the legislature passed another law, as follows:\n An Act Declaring the Emission of Smoke within the Corporate Limits of Certain Cities, Including Cities Acting under Special Charter, to be a Public Nuisance and Conferring upon Such Cities Additional Powers for the Abatement of Such Nuisances and Repealing Chapter Thirty-seven (37) of the Laws of the Thirty-fourth General Assembly. . . .\n Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Iowa:\n Section 1. Declared a nuisance.-The emission of dense smoke within the corporate limits of the cities of the state, including cities acting under commission form of government, now or hereafter having a population of thirty thousand or over and in cities acting under special charter or hereafter having a population of sixteen thousand or over, is hereby declared a nuisance.\n Section 2. Abatement.-Every such city is hereby empowered to provide by ordinance for the abatement of \n\n[239 U.S. 486, 494]\n\u00a0\n such nuisance either by fine or imprisonment, or by action in the district court of the county in which such city is located, or by both; such action to be prosecuted in the name of the city. They may also by ordinance provide all necessary rules and regulations for smoke inspection and the abatement and prevention of the smoke nuisance.\n Section 3. Repeal.-That chapter thirty-seven (37) of the laws of the thirty-fourth general assembly be and the same is hereby by repealed. 35 Laws of Iowa, p. 43.\n This statute likewise includes the city of Des Moines.\n The former statute was repealed by the new one. The effect of this repeal upon the validity of the ordinance is a state question, and as we understand the Iowa decisions, the authority of the ordinance here in question remained unimpaired. The statutory change did not have the effect to annul the ordinance passed under the former identical grant of authority. Allen v. Davenport, 107 Iowa, 90, 77 N. W. 532; State v. Prouty, 115 Iowa, 657, 84 N. W. 670.\n It is further contended that, conceding the statutory authority, the ordinance is in excess of the legislative grant. This question does not seem to have been passed upon specifically in any Iowa case called to our attention. The statute, after declaring the emission of dense smoke within the corporate limits of such cities as Des Moines to be a nuisance, authorizes the city to provide by ordinance for the abatement of such nuisance by fine or imprisonment or by action in the district court of the county, or both, such action to be prosecuted in the name of the city; and, furthermore, municipalities are authorized to provide by ordinance all necessary rules and regulations for smoke inspection and the abatement or prevention of the smoke nuisance. The smoke inspector must be qualified by training and experience to understand the theory and practice of smoke inspection. He has the benefit of counsel of the smoke abatement commis- \n\n[239 U.S. 486, 495]\n\u00a0\n sion, consisting of five members to be appointed by the city council, at least one of whom must have had experience in the installation and conduct of power and heating plants. From the smoke inspector there is an appeal to the smoke abatement commission in case of disagreement over plans for newly constructed plants or reconstruction of old ones. This grant of authority would seem to be sufficient to authorize the passage of an ordinance of a reasonable nature, such as we believe the one now under consideration to be. It delegates authority to carry out details to boards of local commissioners. That such rules and regulations are valid, subject as they are to final consideration in the courts, to determine whether they are reasonably adapted to accomplish the purpose of a statute, has been frequently held. 2 Dill. Mun. Corp. 5th ed.  574. We find nothing in the Iowa cases to indicate that the supreme court of that state has laid down any different rule upon this question. That the courts of Iowa may be resorted to in case of an abuse of the powers vested in the inspector and commission seems to follow from the decision of the supreme court of that state in Hubbell v. Higgins, 148 Iowa, 36, 126 N. W. 914, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 822.\n As to the attack upon the ordinance because of arbitrary classification, this question has been so often discussed that nothing further need be said. The ordinance applies equally to all coming within its terms, and the fact that other businesses might have been included does not make such arbitrary classification as annuls the legislation. Nor does it make classification illegal because certain cities are included and others omitted in the statute. Eckerson v. Des Moines, 137 Iowa, 452, 115 N. W. 177.\n We think the District Court was right in dismissing the bill upon its merits.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nO'KEEFE v.

Mann for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Underwood for the United States.\n Mr. Joseph W. Folk for the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a decree dismissing a bill filed by appellant, as receiver of the New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico Railroad Company, against the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission, praying the annulment of an order of the Commission, dated July 29, 1914, made in the Tap Line Cases, following the decision of this court reported in \n234 U.S. 1\n, 58 L. ed. 1185, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 741. The order required certain trunk line railway companies, including the New Orleans, Taxas, & Mexico, to reopen through routes and publish joint rates to interstate destinations with certain tap lines, including Louisiana & Pacific Railway Company, with which appellant's road had and has a connection, and prohibited any of the line carriers from making to any of the tap lines an allowance or division out of the joint rates in excess of maximum amounts prescribed as follows:\n'For switching a distance of 1 mile or less from the junction, $2 per car; over 1 mile and up to 3 miles from the junction, $3 per car; on shipments from points over 3 miles, and not more than 6 miles from the junction, 1 1\/2 cents per 100 pounds; over 6 miles, and not more than 10 miles from the junction, 2 cents per 100 pounds; over 10 miles, and not more than 20 miles from the junction, \n\n[240 U.S. 294, 296]\n\u00a0\n 2 1\/2 cents per 100 pounds; over 20 miles, and not more than 30 miles from the junction, 3 cents per 100 pounds; over 30 miles, and not more than 40 miles from junction, 3 1\/2 cents per 100 pounds; over 40 miles from the junction, 4 cents per 100 pounds.' [31 Inters. Com. Rep. 492.]\n\n The following is an outline of the history of the case. After the supplemental report of the Commission in Star Grain & Lumber Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. 14 Inters. Com. Rep. 364, 372; 17 Inters. Com. Rep. 338, in which the making of allowances and divisions to tap lines for the traffic of proprietary mills was condemned, although no formal order was entered, the trunk lines, including the New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico, filed cancelation of tariffs theretofore filed providing for joint rates with various tap lines, including the Louisiana & Pacific. Certain of the tap lines filed complaints with the Commission, requesting that through routes and joint rates with trunk lines be enforced. The Commission thereupon investigated the tap line situation with reference to lumber operations in the states of Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, and Texas. Pending this investigation, the cancelation of joint rates was suspended from time to time. On April 23, 1912, the Commission filed its report, and on May 14, 1912, its supplemental report (23 Inters. Com. Rep. 277, 549), and in orders dated May 14 and October 30, 1912, based upon these reports, it found that the tracks and equipment of the tap lines with respect to the industry of the proprietary lumber companies were plant facilities, and the service performed for the proprietary companies in moving logs to the mill and mill products to the trunk line was not a transportation service by a common carrier railroad, but a plant service by a plant facility, and that any allowance or division out of the rate on account thereof was unlawful and resulted in undue and unreasonable preferences and unjust discriminations; and the order of October 30 required the trunk lines, including the \n\n[240 U.S. 294, 297]\n\u00a0\n New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico, to desist and abstain from making any such allowance to any of the tap lines mentioned. Certain of the tap lines, including the Louisiana & Pacific, filed petitions in the commerce court to annul this order. The court granted this relief (209 Fed. 244), and its decision was affirmed by this court (\n234 U.S. 1\n), the court holding that the Commission exceeded its authority in condemning the tap line railroads, when duly incorporated as common carriers under the state laws, as being a mere attempt to evade the commerce law and secure rebates and preferences for themselves. At the same time the court said (p. 28):\n'It is doubtless true, as the Commission amply shows in its full report and supplemental report in these cases, that abuses exist in the conduct and practice of these lines and in their dealings with other carriers which have resulted in unfair advantages to the owners of some tap lines and to discriminations against the owners of others. Because we reach the conclusion that the tap lines involved in these appeals are common carriers, as well of proprietary as nonproprietary traffic, and as such entitled to participate in joint rates with other common carriers, that determination falls far short of deciding, indeed, does not at all decide, that the division of such joint rates may be made at the will of the carriers involved, and without any power of the Commission to control. That body has the authority and it is its duty to reach all unlawful discriminatory practices resulting in favoritism and unfair advantages to particular shippers or carriers. It is not only within its power, but the law makes it the duty of the Commission to make orders which shall nullify such practices resulting in rebating or preferences, whatever form they take and in whatsoever guise they may appear. If the divisions of joint rates are such as to amount to rebates or discriminations in favor of the owners of the tap lines because of their disproportionate amount in view of the \n\n[240 U.S. 294, 298]\n\u00a0\n service rendered, it is within the province of the Commission to reduce the amount so that a tap line shall receive just compensation only for what it actually does.'\n\n After this decision, the Commission, after a rehearing and further argument, but without taking further testimony, and upon the same record on which its orders of May 14 and October 30, 1912, had been entered, made further findings (31 Inters. Com. Rep. 490), upon which was based the order of July 29, 1914, now under attack.\n The New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico Railroad Company operates, directly and through stock ownership of other companies, a system of railroad extending from New Orleans across the states of Louisiana and Texas. The Louisiana & Pacific Railway Company, incorporated under the laws of the state of Louisiana, owns and operates a tap line within that state, including approximately 80 miles of main and branch lines, its main line extending from De Ridder southerly to Lake Charles, approximately 45 miles, crossing and forming a junction with the main line of the New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico at Fulton, which is about 25 miles from De Ridder and 19 miles from Lake Charles. The Louisiana & Pacific connects also with the following trunk lines: At De Ridder, with the Gulf, Colorado, & Santa Fe and the Kansas City Southern; at Bon Ami (near De Ridder) with the Kansas City Southern; and at Lake Charles, with the Louisiana & Western (Southern Pacific Company), the Kansas City Southern, and the St. Louis, Iron Mountain, & Southern. Located along the line of the Louisiana & Pacific are certain lumber mills, which are called proprietary mills because controlled by the same interests which own the stock of the Louisiana & Pacific. Some of these are at De Ridder, Bon Ami, and Longville, all of which points are north of Fulton, while one is at Gossport, near Lake Charles. At Bannister and Ragley, on the line of the Louisiana & Pacific, north of Fulton, there are nonproprietary mills. \n\n[240 U.S. 294, 299]\n\u00a0\n In the year 1906, before the construction or definite location of the New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico, an agreement was made between that company, then known by another name, on the one hand, and the Louisiana & Pacific and the various companies owning the proprietary mills, on the other, whereby the Louisiana & Pacific and the lumber companies agreed to give a substantial amount of their tonnage to the New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico upon a division of the joint rates approximating 35 per cent, not exceeding, however, in any case, 5 1\/2 cents per hundred pounds. The lumber tonnage which, pursuant to this arrangement, the New Orleans, Texas , & Mexico expected to receive and did, until the order of July 29, 1914, actually receive, was a great inducement for the company to locate its line through the territory where it is located. During the five fiscal years prior to July, 1914, its lumber tonnage amounted to 37.45 per cent of its total gross, and of this the Louisiana & Pacific supplied approximately one third, or about 13 per cent of the total gross tonnage. Since the order of July 29, 1914, the New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico has been deprived of practically all of this tonnage, which has been diverted to the other trunk lines because the Louisiana & Pacific, in order to gain as large a division of the joint rate as possible, moves its lumber tonnage from points near the northerly end of its line across the line of the New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico, and delivers it to the trunk lines at the southerly end of its line; and also takes tonnage originating near the southerly end of its line, carries it across the line of the New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico, and delivers it to trunk lines at or near its northerly terminus. It is said that the practical effect of the Commission's order results always to the disadvantage of the New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico with respect to traffic originating upon the line of the Louisiana & Pacific, and that the disadvantage is in no case less than 1 cent per hundred pounds, or approximately $5 per \n\n[240 U.S. 294, 300]\n\u00a0\n car. A single illustration will suffice. From the mill at Longville to the junction of the New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico the distance is 8.2 miles, so that if the product of this mill were shipped over appellant's road, the Louisiana & Pacific would receive only 2 cents per hundred pounds, or $10 per car; whereas, by carrying the product beyond Fulton to Lake Charles, and there delivering it to a trunk line, the Louisiana & Pacific receives a division of 3 cents per hundred; or by taking the Longville product to De Ridder, the Louisiana & Pacific likewise receives 3 cents per hundred. As the trunk lines all operate under a common blanket rate on lumber for this territory, the through rate is the same in all circumstances, and the proprietary mills route their shipments in such manner as to give to the Louisiana & Pacific the largest possible division, always to the disadvantage of the New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico.\n It is insisted by appellant that the Commission was without power to prescribe maximum divisions, as was done by the order of July 29, 1914, because no joint rate was fixed, either by the Commission or by the parties, and they had not been afforded an opportunity to agree in respect to the division. This is based upon the view that  15 of the Commerce act as amended (act of June 18, 1910, chap. 309,  12, 36 Stat. at L. 539, 551, Comp. Stat. 1913,  993, 8583), contains only two provisions dealing expressly with the division of rates, the first being applicable where the carriers fail to agree among themselves upon the division, the other where the carriers have refused or neglected to establish through routes or joint rates voluntarily. Without stopping to consider whether the circumstances of this case bring it within either of these provisions, we deem it clear that to regard these only is to take too narrow a view of the scope of the section. The first part of the same section enacts: 'That whenever . . . the Commission shall be of opinion that any individual or joint rates \n\n[240 U.S. 294, 301]\n\u00a0\n or charges whatsoever demanded, charged, or collected by any common carrier or carriers subject to the provisions of this act for the transportation of . . . property . . . or that any individual or joint classifications, regulations, or practices whatsoever of such carrier or carriers . . . are unjust or unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory, or unduly preferential or prejudicial or otherwise in violation of any of the provisions of this act, the Commission is hereby authorized and empowered to determine and prescribe what will be the just and reasonable individual or joint rate or rates, charge or charges, to be thereafter observed in such case as the maximum to be charged, and what individual or joint classification, regulation, or practice is just, fair, and reasonable, to be thereafter followed, and to make an order that the carrier or carriers shall cease and desist,' etc. And a later part of the same section (p. 553) prescribes: 'If the owner of property transported under this act directly or indirectly renders any service connected with such transportation, or furnishes any instrumentality used therein, the charge and allowance therefor shall be no more than is just and reasonable, and the Commission may, after hearing on a complaint or on its own initiative, determine what is a reasonable charge as the maximum to be paid by the carrier or carriers for the services so rendered or for the use of the instrumentality so surnished, and fix the same by appropriate order,' etc.\n In the case in \n234 U.S. 1\n, this court did not ignore, but fully recognized, the significance of the community of interest between the lumber company and the tap line. It was pointed out (p. 27) that timber and its manufactured products were exempted from the absolute prohibition of the commodity clause of the Hepburn act (of June 29, 1906, chap. 3591, 34 Stat. at L. 584, 585, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563). But this was regarded as one of the circumstances rendering it important that the Commission should deal with the abuses \n\n[240 U.S. 294, 302]\n\u00a0\n found to exist in the division of joint rates with the tap lines, not by abolishing them altogether, but by 'reducing the amount so that a tap line shall receive just compensation only for what it actually does.' So, in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Diffenbaugh, \n222 \nU.S. 42, 46\n, 56 S. L. ed. 83, 87, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 22, the court said: 'The act of Congress in terms contemplates that if the carrier receives services from an owner of property transported, or uses instrumentalities furnished by the latter, he shall pay for them. That is taken for granted in  15; the only restriction being that he shall pay no more than is reasonable, and the only permissive element being that the Commission may determine the maximum.' Again, in Ellis v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n237 \nU.S. 434, 445\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1036, 1041, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 645, it was said: 'The intervening corporation may be a means by which an owner of property transported indirectly renders the services in question, and in that event its charges are subject to the Commission by  15.'\n We are clear that the Commission had jurisdiction to make the order of July 29, 1914\n\n\n Next it is insisted that the Commission applied erroneous principles of law, in that it excluded from consideration competitive conditions as an element in determining whether a division is just and reasonable or unlawfully discriminatory. The order is not open to this criticism. It not only takes competitive conditions into consideration, but establishes the maximum divisions for the very purpose of preventing preferences, discriminations, and rebates, as methods of competition.\n It is insisted that there was no evidence before the Commission to sustain its finding to the effect that any allowance or division in excess of the limits prescribed would result in undue preference and unjust discrimination. This, of course, is to be tested by a consideration of the evidence that was before the Commission. The report and supplemental report of April 23 and May 14, and the orders of May 14 and October 30, 1912, and the \n\n[240 U.S. 294, 303]\n\u00a0\n oral evidence and main exhibits before the Commission from the beginning of the tap line investigation to the making of the order last mentioned were offered in evidence. Appellant, however, has printed only a small part of the testimony, being that which especially relates to the Louisiana & Pacific Railway, its organization, ownership, manner and cost of construction, operating revenue and expenses, accumulated surplus, etc. But, besides these details as to this line, the Commission had before it, as its reports show, a mass of evidence relating to numerous other tap lines, operated under somewhat similar circumstances, including evidence as to the allowances actually made to them out of the joint rate. Evidence of what was allowed on these tap lines had a tendency to show what was reasonable and therefore permissible upon other tap lines, including the Louisiana & Pacific. It is said there was no evidence to enable the Commission to fix a just compensation to that line for a haul of a given number of miles as compared with the just compensation for a haul of a greater or lesser number of miles; no evidence as to terminal expenses, or cost of road haul, or the relation between these factors, or as to other elements which should be taken into account in fixing a division according to the length of haul. But the evidence showed that some limitation was called for, and, in general at least, furnished the materials upon which to base it. A tribunal such as the Interstate Commerce Commission, expert in matters of rate regulation, may be presumed to be able to draw inferences that are not obvious to others. Nor can it be said that the commission's action was arbitrary because, while classifying all the service for distances up to 3 miles from junction as switching, and allowing for this a division of $2 and $3 per car, allowances for all distances above 3 miles are based upon mileage. It is admitted that distance is an element properly to be considered; but appellant insists \n\n[240 U.S. 294, 304]\n\u00a0\n that terminal service, the origin of traffic, etc., are more important elements. This is an administrative question. The tap line problem is exceedingly complex, and the importance of a general rule based upon simple elements easily ascertained is obvious. We are not able to say that the adoption of the mileage basis is, under the circumstances, sufficient to sustain a charge of arbitrary action.\n The final contention, which is that the Commission's order in effect deprives the New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico of its property without due process of law, by denying to it the right to contract and compete for traffic originating on the line of the Louisiana & Pacific, is transparently unsound. The trunk line has no constitutional right to build up its business by paying bonuses or rebates that have been forbidden by act of Congress from considerations affecting the public welfare.\n We are not to be understood as conceding that appellant is in a legal sense aggrieved by the action of the Commission in limiting the allowance to the tap line. The case is singular, in that neither this tap line nor any tap line is complaining that the allowance is too small; nor is any trunk line complaining that it is too great. The real basis of appellant's complaint, representing a trunk line carrier, is that the allowance to the tap line is too small. It is questionable whether it lies in the mouth of the line carrier to object on this ground.\n We recognize the exceptional situation in which appellant's road is placed, and the hardship that results to it from the application of the order of July 29, 1914, to the traffic originating upon the line of the Louisiana & Pacific.

The defendants justified under a decree establishing the Irrigation Company's priority and a statute making the decree conclusive after four years. The plaintiff replied and argued that the statutes, if construed to have the alleged effect, took his property without due process of law, contrary to the 14th Amendment. The defendants demurred and the state courts upheld the defense. 56 Colo. 545, 139 Pac. 536.\n The case is this: In 1879 the state established water districts, the plaintiff's water rights being in district 23 and the defendant's in district 8, directly below 23, upon the South Platte. Jurisdiction was conferred upon the district courts for the proper county to adjudicate all questions concerning priority of appropriation and other questions of right between 'owners of ditches drawing \n\n[242 U.S. 20, 25]\n\u00a0\n water for irrigation purposes from the same stream or its tributaries within the same water district.' Laws of 1879, Feb. 19,  19, p. 99. Rev. Stat. 1908,  3276. The provisions were enlarged by an Act of February 23, 1881, p. 142, but still seemingly confined to controversies between parties in the same district, until they came to the sections of limitation. By  34 the act was not to prevent suits within four years, and by  35 after 'four years from the time of rendering a final decree, in any water district, all parties whose interests are thereby affected shall be deemed and held to have acquiesced in the same . . . and thereafter all persons shall be forever barred from setting up any claim to priority of rights to water for irrigation in such water district adverse or contrary to the effect of such decree.' Laws of 1881, pp. 159, 160. Rev. Stat. 1908,  3313, 3314. Later statutes were enacted in 1887 and 1903, creating divisions, and requiring the irrigation division engineers to tabulate the priorities and rights as established by decree in the different districts of their divisions, and to administer the use of water accordingly. But these statutes are not material. The parties' rights were held to be fixed under the Act of 1881\n\n\n On December 10, 1883, the proper court for the defendant company's district made a decree that the company was entitled to a priority of right to the use of water for irrigation purposes of 1184 cubic feet of water per second from the South Platte and its tributaries, dated January 18, 1879, which was prior to the date of the plaintiff's rights. It will be observed that the Act of 1881 was in force when this decree was made. The plaintiff contends that the construction of  35 of the act, as applying to parties in a different district, this construction having been first announced after the period of limitation had gone by, had the effect of a new statute declaring his rights barred by time already elapsed, and attempted to \n\n[242 U.S. 20, 26]\n\u00a0\n make conclusive against him a proceeding to which he was not a party and in which he would not have been heard.\n So far as the last objection goes the answer is that if it be true that the plaintiff was not entitled to be heard on the defendant's decree, still there was nothing to hinder the state from providing that, if he took no step to assert his rights within a reasonable time after the judicial assertion of an adverse title, the decree being a public fact, he should lose those rights See Barker v. Harvey, \n181 U.S. 481\n, 45 L. ed. 963, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690; Soper v. Lawrence Bros. Co. \n201 \nU.S. 359, 367\n, 368 S., 50 L. ed. 788, 791, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 473; American Land Co. v.

The answer to the first half of the plaintiff's contention is no less plain. It is that the construction of a statute does not take a party's property without due process of law simply because it takes him by surprise, and when it is too late for him to act on the construction and save his rights. That is all that the plaintiff has to complain of. There was no different construction of the statute by the court before the limitation had run, that might have lulled him to repose. The only decisions relied upon by the plaintiff as tending to favor him are Nichols v. McIntosh, 19 Colo. 22, 34 Pac. 278, and Sterling Irrig. Co. v. Downer, 19 Colo. 595, 36 Pac. 787, which were not rendered until 1893 and 1894, and both of which are consistent with Ft. Lyon Canal Co. v. Arkansas Valley Sugar Beet & Irrig. Land Co. 39 Colo. 332, 90 Pac. 1023, establishing the construction followed in this case. It should be added that, however strong the argument for a different interpretation, the one adopted also was strongly supported, so that there can be no pretense that a perverse reading of the law was used as an excuse for giving a retrospective effect to the law of 1903. The decision was absolutely entitled to respect.\n It is suggested that the cases cited established a rule of \n\n[242 U.S. 20, 27]\n\u00a0\n property, and that any departure from it violated the plaintiff's rights under the 14th Amendment. But we already have said that the cases do not establish the rule supposed, and if they did, something more would be necessary before the plaintiff could come to this court. Sauer v.

Frierson and Lewis M. Coleman for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[241 U.S. 16, 18]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. B. E. Tatum, P. H. Thach, Felix D. Lynch, George W. Chamlee, and Joe V. Williams for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was brought, in the year 1908, by Jennie B. Gray to recover damages for the death of her husband, who was employed in the operation of the railroad of which the plaintiff in error and another were receivers. The original declaration sought recovery for negligence, at common law, and did not allege that the deceased was injured while engaged in interstate commerce. The plaintiff was permitted to file an additional count, and this was subsequently amended so as to allege the interstate character of the employment of the deceased at the time of his injury. The action was first tried in November, 1912; the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff of $10,000 and judgment was entered accordingly. Thereupon, the trial judge granted a new trial upon the ground that he had erred in his instructions \n\n[241 U.S. 16, 19]\n\u00a0\n to the jury with respect to the burden of proof. At the second trial, in 1913, a verdict was directed for the defendants (the plaintiffs in error) and judgment in their favor was entered. The court of civil appeals reversed this judgment and reinstated the judgment entered upon the verdict at the first trial. The court of civil appeals did not consider the record of the second trial, but was of the opinion that the verdict first rendered in favor of the plaintiff should not have been set aside. This decision was affirmed by the supreme court of the state, without opinion.\n The plaintiff in error presents for our consideration these assignments of error: (1) That the court erred in not holding that both counts of the declaration stated a case controlled by the Federal employers' liability act, and that, therefore, the widow could not recover in a suit begun in her own name; and (2) that the court erred in not holding that the evidence on the first trial made a case within the Federal act.\n In support of the first assignment, it is insisted that the amendment inserting the allegation that the injury was sustained while the decedent was engaged in interstate commerce amended both counts of the declaration. The state court treated it as an amendment of the second count, and thus the declaration on which the case was tried was deemed to contain two counts, 'one under the common law of Tennessee and the other charging negligence under the employers' liability act.' From a Federal standpoint, the question is not important, for if it had been shown that the injury had been received in interstate commerce, the defendants would have been entitled to insist upon the applicable Federal law as the exclusive measure of their liability, and they would not have lost this right merely because the plaintiff had seen fit to present the claim 'in an alternative way,' by means of separate counts. Wabash R. Co. v. Hayes, 234 \n\n[241 U.S. 16, 20]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 86, 90, 58 L. ed. 1226, 1230, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 729, 6 N. C. C. A. 224. And in the absence of a showing bringing the injury within the Federal act, the question whether the declaration permitted a recovery at common law was a state question.\n It was distinctly stated by the court of civil appeals that if the proof showed 'that the deceased was engaged in interstate commerce when he was injured,' the court would 'be compelled to hold that the trial judge was not in error in setting aside the verdict.' But it was found that there was no basis in the evidence for such a conclusion, and the second assignment of error challenges this ruling. The court of civil appeals thus stated the facts:\n'The proof indicates that the deceased came into Alton Park on a passenger train, and, as a part of this train, there were three cars loaded with peaches. These cars were taken out of the passenger train at Alton Park, when the train went on to the Chattanooga depot. After these fruit cars were taken out of the passenger train, the deceased was directed by one of his superiors to have them re-iced and then taken to Cravens and delivered to the N., C. & St. L. Railroad Company. The proof does not show that the passenger train on which the deceased came into Alton Park, and a part of which the fruit cars were, came from another state, and in fact fails to show where it came from. The proof likewise fails to show how far through or into what part of Tennessee the railroad of defendant company is located, and to what point it operates trains . . . . The fruit cars which he was ordered to take and deliver to the Nashville road, so far as his record discloses, were taken out of a passenger train in Alton Park. The proof does not indicate where they came from, whether from another state, or whether they were picked up in Tennessee. . . . We do not know where the passenger train came from, nor where these fruit cars come from; all we do know is, they were \n\n[241 U.S. 16, 21]\n\u00a0\n cut out of the passenger train at Alton Park, and the deceased was ordered to take them down into Chattanooga and deliver them to the N., C. & St. L. Railroad Company. That being true, the deceased and these cars were engaged in intrastate commerce when he received his fatal injury, and not in interstate commerce.' [5 Tenn. C. C. A. 524.]\n\n The evidence has not been printed, but by stipulation between the parties it is agreed that the testimony also showed that the passenger train in question had left Chattanooga at 7 o'clock in the morning of the day of the accident, and that it had come into Alton Park from the south, on its return trip, late in the afternoon. But this still leaves undisclosed the origin and destination of the cars in the movement of which the decedent was employed.\n It is apparent that there was no evidence requiring the conclusion that the deceased was engaged in interstate commerce at the time of his injury, and we are asked to supply the deficiency by taking judicial notice that the cars came from without the state. This contention we are unable to sustain. The make-up of trains and the movement of cars are not matters which we may assume to know without evidence. The state court, with its intimate knowledge of the local situation, thought that such an assumption on its part would be wholly unwarranted and we cannot say that it erred in this view. The fact that Chattanooga and its suburb, Alton Park, were near the state line, did not establish that the cars had crossed it. The defendants knew the actual movement of the cars, and, failing to inform the court upon this point, cannot complain that they have been deprived of a Federal right.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPACIFIC LIVE STOCK CO. v.

Clements for appellant.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 440, 442]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George M. Brown, Attorney General of Oregon, and Messrs. George T. Cochran, Will R. King, James T. Chinnock, Percy A. Cupper, and J. O. Bailey for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill in equity to enjoin a proceeding before the State Water Board of Oregon, looking to the ascertainment and adjudication of the relative rights of the various claimants to the waters of Silvies river, in that state, the grounds upon which such relief is sought being ( a) that it is essential to protect a jurisdiction previously acquired by the district court, and (b) that the local statute, 3 Lord's Oregon Laws, title XLIII., chap. 6, Laws 1913, chaps. 82, 86, and 97, authorizing and controlling the proceeding, is repugnant to the due process of law clause of the 14th Amendment. An interlocutory injunction was denied by the district court, three judges sitting (217 Fed. 95), and motions to dismiss the bill, as disclosing no right to relief, were afterwards sustained.\n The plaintiff, a California corporation, owns large tracts of land along the river, and claims a vested right to use upon these lands a portion of the waters of the stream for irrigation and other beneficial purposes. The defendants are the members of the State Water Board, and a few out of many persons and corporations claiming similar rights in the waters of the river. The statute under which the proceeding assailed is being conducted was enacted in 1909 and amended in 1913, and most of the rights affected by the proceeding are claimed to have arisen prior to the \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 443]\n\u00a0\n statute,-the plaintiff's as much as thirty years before. All claimants to the waters of the river, including the plaintiff, were brought into the proceeding by due notice and in conformity with the statute.\n A general outline of the statute, as it has been construed by the supreme court of the state,1 will serve to simplify the questions to be considered. It recognizes that in Oregon rights to use the waters of streams for irrigation and other beneficial purposes may be acquired by appropriation, adopts a comprehensive scheme for securing an economical, orderly, and equitable distribution of the waters among those entitled to their use, incidentally prescribes a mode of determining the relatives rights of the various claimants to the waters of each stream, and in large measure commits the administration of the scheme to the State Water Board and officers acting under the supervision of its members. When one or more users of water from any stream request it, the board, if finding that the conditions justify it, is required to set in motion a proceeding looking to an ascertainment and adjudication of all rights to the waters of that stream. Every material step in the proceeding is to be attended with notice and an opportunity to be heard, the adequacy of which is manifest. In the beginning each claimant is required to present to the division superintendent a sworn statement of his claim, showing its nature, inception, and extent, and all the particulars upon which it is based. These statements are to be exposed to public inspection, so that every claimant may determine whether there is occasion for him to oppose or contest the claims of others. The state engineer, or a qualified assistant, is to measure the flow of the stream, the carrying capacity of the several ditches taking water \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 444]\n\u00a0\n therefrom, and the land irrigated or susceptible of irrigation from each ditch, and also to take such other observations as may be essential to a proper understanding of the claims involved, a report of all of which is to be made in writing. Any claimant desiring to contest the claim of another may present to the division superintendent a sworn statement showing the grounds of contest, and obtain a hearing before that officer, at which the parties may present whatever evidence they have, and may secure the attendance of witnesses by compulsory process. After the evidence in the contests is taken, it and the sworn statements of the several claimants, with the report of the engineer's measurements and observations, are to be laid before the board,-the statements and the report both being regarded as evidence appropriate to be considered. The board is then to examine all the evidence, make findings of fact therefrom, enter an order embodying the findings and provisionally determining the relative rights of the several claimants, and transmit the evidence and a copy of the order to the circuit court of the county wherein the stream or some part of it lies. Exceptions to the board's findings and order may be presented to the court, and in disposing of them the court is to follow as near as may be the practice prevailing in suits in equity. All parties in interest, including the board, as representing the state, are to be fully heard. Further evidence may be taken by the court, or the matter may be remanded with directions that additional evidence be taken, and that the matter be again considered by the board, in which event the evidence and a copy of the further order of the board are to be transmitted to the court as in the first instance. In short, upon exceptions the court may reexamine the whole matter, and enter such decree as the law and the evidence may require, whether it be an affirmance or a modification of the board's order. And even where no exceptions are presented, a decree giving effect \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 445]\n\u00a0\n to the order is to be entered; that is to say, the matter is not to be left as if the order in itself constituted an effective adjudication. An appeal from the court's decree may be taken to the supreme court of the state 'as in other cases in equity,' except that the time therefor is substantially shortened. When the rights involved are adjudicated the decree is to be 'conclusive as to all prior rights and the rights of all existing claimants,' and the right of each claimant as so settled is to be appropriately entered and shown upon the records of the board and upon those of the proper county. Each claimant also is to receive from the board a certificate setting forth the priority, extent, and purpose of his right, and, if it be for irrigation purposes, a description of the land to which it is appurtenant. That the statute is not intended to take away or impair any vested right to any water or to its use is expressly declared in its 1st and 70th sections, 3 Lord's Oregon Laws,  6594, 6595\n\n\n At the time the statute was adopted, and continuously until this suit was begun, there were pending undetermined in the district court2 two suits in equity brought by the present plaintiff, one against two Oregon corporations and the other against another corporation of that state, in each of which suits the relative rights of the parties thereto in the waters of Silvies river were in controversy. These rights are reasserted and again brought in controversy in the proceeding before the board.\n When that proceeding was first set in motion, the Pacific Live Stock Company, the plaintiff in this suit, presented to the board a petition and bond for the removal of the proceeding, or a part of it, alleged to involve a separable controversy, to the district court of the United States, \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 446]\n\u00a0\n upon the ground that it was a suit between citizens of different states. But the attempted removal was not sustained, for the district court remanded the proceeding, and in that connection held that, while it was pending before the board, it was essentially preliminary and administrative, and not a suit at law or in equity within the meaning of the removal statute. 199 Fed. 495.\n Thereafter the plaintiff presented to the division superintendent a sworn statement of its claim, accompanied by the fee prescribed,-at the same time protesting that the fee was extortionate, that the matter should be adjudicated in the Federal court, and that the local statute was repugnant to the 14th Amendment. More than two hundred other claimants also appeared and submitted statements of their claims, all being described as higher up the stream than that of the plaintiff. When the statements were opened to public inspection many contests were initiated. Several of these were against the plaintiff's claim; a large number were by the plaintiff against other claims, and there were others in which, it is said, the plaintiff was not directly concerned. It was at this stage of the proceeding, and before any evidence was taken in any of the contests, that this suit was brought.\n Upon the assumption (1) that the removal proceedings were effective, ( 2) that the proceeding before the board is substantially identical with the pending suits, and (3) that that proceeding is essentially judicial in its nature, the plaintiff insists that the continued prosecution of the proceeding before the board constitutes an inadmissible interference with the district court's jurisdiction, and that this jurisdiction should be maintained and protected by an appropriate injunction. \n3\n The insistence must \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 447]\n\u00a0\n be overruled, because the assumption upon which it rests cannot be indulged.\n Nothing was accomplished by the removal proceedings. The district court did not take jurisdiction under them, but, on the contrary, by its remanding order, adjudged that they were unauthorized. That order is not subject to review, either directly or indirectly, but is final and conclusive. Judicial Code,  28 [36 Stat. at L. 1094, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1010]; Missouri P. R. Co. v.

In so holding, it is not intimated that the result would be different if the order were now open to review. See Upshur County v. Rich, \n135 U.S. 467\n, 474, et seq., 34 L. ed. 196, 199, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651, and cases cited.\n The rule that where the same matter is brought before courts of concurrent jurisdiction, the one first obtaining jurisdiction will retain it until the controversy is determined, to the entire exclusion of the other, and will maintain and protect its jurisdiction by an appropriate injunction, is confined in its operation to instances where both suits are substantially the same; that is to say, where there is substantial identity in the interests represented, in the rights asserted, and in the purposes sought. Buck v. Colbath, 3 Wall. 334, 345, 18 L. ed. 257, 261; Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679, 715, 20 L. ed. 666, 671; Rickey Land & Cattle Co. v. Miller & Lux, \n218 \nU.S. 258, 262\n, 54 S. L. ed. 1032, 1038, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 11. This is not such an instance. The proceeding sought to be enjoined, although in some respects resembling the prior suits, is essentially different from them. They are merely private suits brought to restrain alleged encroachments upon the plaintiff's water right, and, while requiring an ascertainment of the rights of the parties in the waters of the river, as between themselves, it is certain that they do not require any other or further determination respecting those waters. Unlike them, the proceeding in question is a quasi public proceeding, set in motion by a public agency of the state. All claimants are required to appear and prove their claims; no one can refuse without \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 448]\n\u00a0\n forfeiting his claim, and all have the same relation to the proceeding. It is intended to be universal and to result in a complete ascertainment of all existing rights, to the end, first, that the waters may be distributed, under public supervision, among the lawful claimants according to their respective rights without needless waste or controversy; second, that the rights of all may be evidenced by appropriate certificates and public records, always readily accessible, and may not be dependent upon the testimony of witnesses, with its recognized infirmities and uncertainties; and, third, that the amount of surplus or unclaimed water, if any, may be ascertained and rendered available to intending appropriators.\n Referring to a situation resembling that to which this proceeding is addressed, the supreme court of Maine said in Warren v. Westbrook Mfg. Co. 88 Me. 58, 66, 35 L.R.A. 388, 51 Am. St. Rep. 372, 33 Atl. 665: 'To make the water power of economic value, the rights to its sue, and the division of its use, according to those rights, should be determined in advance. This prior determination is evidently essential to the peaceful and profitable use by the different parties having rights in a common power. To leave them in their uncertainty-to leave one to encroach upon the other- to leave each to use as much as he can, and leave the other to sue at law after the injury-is to leave the whole subject-matter to possible waste and destruction.' In considering the purpose of the state in authorizing the proceeding, the supreme court of Oregon said in Re Willow Creek, 74 Or. 592, 613, 617, 144 Pac. 505: 'To accelerate the development of the state, to promote peace and good order, to minimize the danger of vexatious controversies wherein the shovel was often used as an instrument of warfare, and to provide a convenient way for the adjustment and recording of the rights of the various claimants to the use of the water of a stream or other source of supply at a reasonable expense, the state enacted the law of 1909, thereby \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 449]\n\u00a0\n to a limited extent calling into requisition its police power. . . . Water rights, like all other rights, are subject to such reasonable regulations as are essential to the general welfare, peace, and good order of the citizens of the state, to the end that the use of water by one, however absolute and unqualified his right thereto, shall not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others entitled to the equal privilege of using water from the same source, nor injurious to the rights of the public.' The district court, when making the remanding order, said: 'The water is the res or subject-matter of the controversy. It is to be divided among the several claimants according to their respective rights. Each claimant is therefore directly and vitally interested, not only in establishing the validity and extent of his own claim, but in having determined all of the other claims.' [199 Fed. 502.] And that court further said that what was intended was to secure in an economical and practical way a determination of the rights of the various claimants to the use of the waters of the stream, 'and thus [to] avoid the uncertainty as to water titles and the long and vexatious controversies concerning the same which have heretofore greatly retarded the material development of the state.' In such a proceeding the rights of the several claimants are so closely related that the presence of all is essential to the accomplishment of its purposes, and it hardly needs statement that these cannot be attained by mere private suits in which only a few of the claimants are present, for only their rights as between themselves could be determined. As against other claimants and the public the determination would amount to nothing. And so, upon applying the test before indicated, it is apparent that the assumed substantial identity between the proceeding and the pending suits does not exist.\n The supreme court of the state holds that while the proceeding is pending before the board it is merely pre- \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 450]\n\u00a0\n liminary and administrative, not judicial, and as this holding is a necessary result of that court's construction of the statute, we accept it as correct. The question was first suggested in Pacific Livestock Co. v. Cochran, 73 Or. 417, 144 Pac. 668, and the court then said, p. 429: 'It is not necessary here to decide whether the proceeding by the board to determine water rights is judicial or administrative. To a large extent it is administrative, but like many proceedings of that character, the board must also act in a quasi judicial capacity. A determination of the water rights to a stream finally ends as a report to the circuit court, and a decree of final determination by that court.' Afterwards the question was both raised and determined in Re Willow Creek, 74 Or. 592, 144 Pac. 505. The court there reviewed the several provisions bearing upon the duties and powers of the board, and said, pp. 610, 612, 614: 'Their duties are executive or administrative in their nature. In proceedings under the statute the board is not authorized to make determinations which are final in character. Their findings and orders are prima facie final and binding until changed in some proper proceeding. The findings of the board are advisory rather than authoritative. It is only when the courts of the state have obtained jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of the persons interested, and rendered a decree in the matter, determining such rights, that, strictly speaking, an adjudication or final determination is made. It might be said that the duties of the water board are quasi judicial in their character. Such duties may be devolved by law on boards whose principal duties are administrative. . . . The duties of the board of control are similar to those of a referee appointed by the court. . . . By proceeding in accordance with the statute, when the matter is presented to the court for judicial action, it is in an intelligible form. The water board and state may then be represented by counsel.' \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 451]\n\u00a0\n As an alternative to its first contention, which we hold untenable, the plaintiff insists that the statute is repugnant to the due process of law clause of the 14th Amendment, first, because it requires a claimant, at his own expense, to assert and prove his claim before the board, and to pay an extortionate fee for having it considered,-all under penalty of forfeiting his claim if he refuses,-notwithstanding the board acts only administratively and its findings and order are not conclusive; second, because it permits the board to accept and act upon the sworn statements of claimants taken ex parte and upon the data set forth in the unsworn report of the engineer, without, as is asserted, affording any opportunity for showing their true value, or the want of it, by cross-examination or otherwise; and, third, because it requires that the board's findings and order, although only administrative in character, be followed and given effect in the distribution of the water pending the action of the circuit court upon them.\n A serious fault in this contention is that it does not recognize the true relation of the proceeding before the board to that before the court. They are not independent or unrelated, but parts of a single statutory proceeding, the earlier stages of which are before the board and the later stages before the court. In notifying claimants, taking statements of claim, receiving evidence, and making an advisory report, the board merely paves the way for an adjudication by the court of all the rights involved. As the supreme court of the state has said, the board's duties are much like those of a referee. (And see Washington ex rel. Oregon R. & Nav. Co. v. Fairchild, \n224 \nU.S. 510, 526\n, 527 S., 56 L. ed. 863, 868, 869, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 535.) All the evidence laid before it goes before the court, where it is to be accorded its proper weight and value. That the state, consistently with due process of law, may thus commit the preliminary proceedings to the board and the final hearing and adjudication to the court, is not de- \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 452]\n\u00a0\n batable. And so, the fact that the board acts administratively and that its report is not conclusive does not prevent a claimant from receiving the full benefit of submitting his claim and supporting proof to the board. That he is to do this at his own expense affords no ground for objection; on the contrary, it is in accord with the practice in all administrative and judicial proceedings. The fee alleged to be extortionate is a charge graduated according to the amount of land irrigated under the claim submitted, and is 15 cents per acre for the first 100 acres, 5 cents per acre for the next 900 acres, and 1 cent per acre for any excess over 1,000 acres. The purpose with which it is exacted is explained in the following excerpt from the opinion of the supreme court of the state in Pacific Livestock Co. v. Cochran, 73 Or. 417, 429, 430, 144 Pac. 668: 'The board is required to take testimony which consumes the time of a stenographer paid by the state; to make, through the state engineer, an examination of the stream and the works diverting water therefrom, including the measurement of the discharge of the stream and of the capacity of the various ditches and canals; to examine and measure the irrigated lands, and to gather such other data as may be necessary; to reduce the same to writing and make it a matter of record in the office of the state engineer; to make maps and plats of the various ditches and of the stream,-all at the expense of the state. That these services are beneficial to the claimant and necessary to the preservation of his rights in the stream and the protection and assurance of his title goes without saying. . . . It is reasonable to assume that the expense to the state of the investigation, mapping, taking testimony, and other acts involved in the determination of the claimant's rights, will equal and in many cases exceed the amount of the fee charged; and that the method indicated by the act by which the amount is determined is \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 453]\n\u00a0\n eminently fair.' In our opinion, the charge is not extortionate and its exaction is not otherwise inconsistent with due process of law.\n Upon examining the statute and the decisions of the supreme court of the state construing and applying it, we are persuaded that it is not intended that the board shall accept and act upon anything as evidence that is devoid of evidential value, or in respect of which the claimants concerned are not given a fair opportunity to show its true value, or the want of it, in an appropriate way. On the contrary, the statute discloses a fixed purpose to secure timely notice to all claimants of every material step in the proceeding, and full opportunity to be heard in respect of all that bears upon the validity, extent, and priority of their claims. And while it is true, according to the concessions at the bar, that the sworn statements of claim are taken ex parte in the first instance, it also is true that they are then opened to public inspection, that opportunity is given for contesting them, and that, upon the hearing of the contests, full opportunity is had for the examination of witnesses, including those making the statements, and for the production of any evidence appropriate to be considered. Thus the fact that the original statements are taken ex parte becomes of no moment. And while it is true that the state engineer's report is accepted as evidence, although not sworn to by him, it also is true that the measurements and examinations shown therein are made and reported in the discharge of his official duties and under the sanction of his oath of office, and that timely notice of the date when they are to begin is given to all claimants. The report becomes a public document accessible to all, and is accepted as prima facie evidence, but not as conclusive. Re Willow Creek, 74 Or. 592, 628, 144 Pac. 505. Of the occasion for such a report, the supreme court of the state says in that case, p. 613: 'In a proceeding \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 454]\n\u00a0\n before the board, provision is made for an impartial examination and measurement of the water in a stream, of the ditches and canals, and of the land susceptible of irrigation, and for the gathering of other essential data by the state engineer, including the preparation of maps, all to be made a matter of record in the office of the state engineer, as a foundation for such hearing and to facilitate a proper understanding of the rights of the parties interested. Under the old procedure such information was often omitted. When measurements were made by the various parties to a suit they were nearly always made by different methods and were conflicting. The other evidence in regard thereto, being mere estimates, rendered a determination extremely difficult for the court and of questionable accuracy and value when made.' Considering the nature of the report, and that claimants may oppose it with other evidence, it is plain that its use as evidence is not violative of due process, Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co. \n236 \nU.S. 412, 430\n, 59 S. L. ed. 644, 657, P.U.R.1915D, 1072, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 328.\n The provision that the water shall be distributed in conformity with the board's order pending the adjudication by the court has the sanction of many precedents in the legislation of Congress and of the several states, notably in the provision in the interstate commerce act directing that the orders of the Commission shall be effective from a date shortly after they are made, unless their operation be restrained by injunction. These legislative precedents, while not controlling, are entitled to much weight, especially as they have been widely accepted as valid. Although containing no provision for an injunction, the statute under consideration permits the same result to be reached in another way, for it declares that the operation of the board's order 'may be stayed in whole or in part' by giving a bond in such amount as the judge of the court in which the proceeding is pending may prescribe, conditioned for the payment of such dam- \n\n[241 U.S. 440, 455]\n\u00a0\n ages as may accrue by reason of the stay. It is not, therefore, as if the requirement were absolute. As has been seen, the order is made only after adequate notice and full opportunity to be heard, and when made is, with reason, deemed prima facie correct. It relates to flowing water, to the use of which there are conflicting claims. Unless diverted and used, the water will pass on and be lost. No claimant is in possession, and all assert a right to take from the common source. In this situation we think it is within the power of the state to require that, pending the final adjudication, the water shall be distributed according to the board's order, unless a suitable bond be given to stay its operation. Such a requirement is not arbitrary, does not take from one and give to another, and is not otherwise offensive to a right conception of due process. Detroit & M. R. Co. v. Michigan R.

Harr, Charles H. Bates, George A. Knight, and Charles J. Heggerty for petitioner.\n Mr. James W. Ryan (by special leave) and Mr. John L. McNab for respondent.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 245, 248]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a libel in personam for $30.33, wages and victualing money from September 24 to October 1, 1913, and for a sum equal to one day's pay for every day during which payment had been or should be delayed. The libel was filed on October 20, 1913. On November 5, 1913, the district court entered a decree for $151.59 with interest from the date of its decree, and $36.25 costs. 209 Fed. 264. The libellee, the present petitioner, appealed, but without success, and on May 18, 1914, the decree was affirmed with directions to add one day's pay for every day since the former decree. On October 6, 1914, an order was made by the circuit court of appeals that the petitioner should pay to the proctor for the appellee the amount of the judgment of the district court with costs and proctor's fee as allowed, and should pay to the clerk of the district court the additional amount to the date of deposit of the penalty adjudged to be continuing; to abide the result of an application to this court for a writ of certiorari, and that upon such payment the running of the penalty should cease so far as the judgment of the circuit court of appeals was concerned.\n The facts are these: On July 24, 1913, the libellant shipped as chief steward, under articles, from San Francisco to Ancon, Canal Zone, and such other ports as the master might direct, and back to a final port of discharge in San Francisco, for a term of time not exceeding six calendar months. The vessel returned to San Francisco \n\n[241 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n on September 23, and on September 24, 1913, the libellant was paid in full by the shipping commissioner, and that date noted as the date of termination of voyage on the articles. As seems to have been usual, however, the libellant remained on board, working, and, in the ordinary course, probably would have signed new articles for the next voyage, but on October 1 was notified that he was discharged. On his demanding his wages for his services in port he was told that silverware to the amount of $32.90 was missing, that he was accountable for it, and this sum offset his claim. There is no doubt that this offset, which was alleged again in the pleadings, was set up in good faith, but as both the courts below have found that it was not made out, we assume that it was not proved.\n The statute under which the penalty was imposed is Rev. Stat.  4529, as amended by the act of December 21, 1898, chap. 28,  4, 30 Stat. at L. 756, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8320. By that act 'the master or owner of any vessel making coasting voyages shall pay to every seaman his wages within two days after the termination of the agreement under which he shipped, or at the time such seaman is discharged, whichever first happens; and in the case of vessels making foreign voyages, or from a port on the Atlantic to a port on the Pacific, or vice versa, within twenty-four hours after the cargo has been discharged, or within four days after the seaman has been discharged, whichever first happens. . . . Every master or owner who refuses or neglects to make payment in manner hereinbefore mentioned without sufficient cause shall pay to the seaman a sum equal to one day's pay for each and every day during which payment is delayed beyond the respective periods.' We assume, not only, as we have said, that the claim of offset was not established, but the more doubtful proposition that it did not furnish sufficient cause for the delay. We assume, therefore, that the petitioner did not sufficiently justify putting the libellant to a suit. \n\n[241 U.S. 245, 250]\n\u00a0\n But it is far less clear that the district court was justified in treating the case as within the penalties of the act. The statute deals with voyages. The voyage for which the libellant shipped was at an end, viz., from San Francisco out and back to that port, or till the end of six months, whichever first happened. On the return to San Francisco within the time the libellant was paid all that was due to him, and he himself lays his employment as beginning in San Francisco on September 25, after the voyage described in the articles was at an end. No new articles had been signed, and it would seem on the allegations of the libel, coupled with the admitted facts, that the libellant's legal standing was under an oral contract for a few days in port while hoping to be reshipped. It seems to us a very strong thing to say that any fair construction of the facts brings the case within the act. But, as the two courts have agreed upon this proposition also, and as the writ would not have been granted to reopen the inquiry into those particular facts, we assume that upon this also they were right.\n It is a very different thing, however, to say that the delay occasioned by the appeal was not for sufficient cause. Even on the assumption that the petitioner was wrong, it had strong and reasonable ground for believing that the statute ought not to be held to apply. So that the question before us is whether we are to construe the act of Congress as imposing this penalty during a reasonable attempt to secure a revision of doubtful questions of law and fact, although its language in 'neglect . . . without sufficient cause.' The question answers itself. We are not to assume that Congress would attempt to cut off the reasonable assertion of supposed rights by devices that have had to be met by stringent measures when practised by the states Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 52 L. ed. 714, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441, 14 Ann. Cas. 764. There was sufficient cause for the neglect to pay after the decree of the district court, since the payment of \n\n[241 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n the original wages without the penalty that was reasonably in dispute would neither have been accepted nor allowed.\n Not only so, but there was further reasonable cause for the delay by appeal in the fact that victualing money was included in the wages by which the penalty was measured. Seeing that the petitioner was held as if the articles still were in force, the question arises how the wages could be estimated at more than the articles fixed. The so-called port pay which added a dollar a day for food was an arrangement altogether outside the articles, and the demand for it and the allowance of it not only raised a new question, but intensified the doubt as to how it could be said that the voyage was not ended and that the penalty could be applied. See Palace Shipping Co. v. Caine \n\n[241 U.S. 245, 1907]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 386, 76 L. J. K. B. N. S. 1079, 23 Times L. R. 731, 9 Ann. Cas. 526. We shall allow the decree of the district court to stand, as we have stated, but there was ample justification for the appeal, and on both the above grounds sufficient reason for the delay. We need not consider whether, if there had been no such reason, there would be any escape from Atty. Gen. v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n141 U.S. 40\n, 35 L. ed. 628, 11 Sup. Ct.

James D. Williamson, J. A. Stanford, and H. H. Cooper for defendants in error.\n\n Memorandum opinion by Mr. Justice McReynolds, by direction of the court:\n In November, 1909, M. A. Rosenbloom was instantly killed by a ballast car being pushed by an engine along track No. 5 in the railway company's switch yard at \n\n[240 U.S. 439, 440]\n\u00a0\n Amarillo, Texas. Proceeding in behalf of herself, as next friend for her two minor children, and for the use and benefit of his parents, the deceased's widow instituted this suit for damages in the district court, Potter county, Texas. The jury returned a verdict for $7,000-apportioned $ 2,000 respectively to the the widow and each child, and $500 to each parent; judgment thereon was sustained by the court of civil appeals (141 S. W. 175) and by the state supreme court, -- Tex. --, 173 S. W. 215.\n Among other things the amended petition alleges: That Rosenbloom was employed by the railway as ticket clerk and required to be in and at the switch yard in order to take and preserve a record of numbers on outgoing cars and to seal those which needed it. That when the accident occurred a long freight train was leaving the yard on its regular run along switch track No. 4; as required by his duties, Rosenbloom was walking between tracks 4 and 5, and near the train, observing and noting car numbers; while so engaged and exercising due care a ballast car, negligently pushed along track No. 5, struck him with great violence and caused his death.\n It conclusively appears from the evidence that the freight train on track 4 consisted of thirty odd cars moving, with one exception, in interstate commerce. The petition declares that, in pursuance of his duty, deceased was taking the numbers of these cars; there was some direct evidence to the same effect; and certainly enough had been shown to support a finding that when killed he was engaged in interstate commerce. The trial court refused the following instruction:\n'If M. A. Rosenbloom, at the time of his death, was engaged in examining seals and making record of seals on cars being transported interstate over the line of defendant and other lines of connecting carriers, and if such work was a necessary part and customary work, reasonably \n\n[240 U.S. 439, 441]\n\u00a0\n carried on by defendant as a part of its business, transporting freight interstate over its line, or if he had then just completed such inspection of said train and had not yet completed his record and placed it in the place where usually kept, then you will return a verdict for the defendant on its special plea that plaintiff has no right to maintain this suit in the capacity in which she sues.'\n\n Upon a clearly erroneous assumption that there was nothing on which to base such request, the supreme court approved its refusal. The record discloses no proper reason for thus denying plaintiff in error a right claimed under the Federal employers' liability act. If when struck deceased was employed in interstate commerce, the right of recovery depended upon that act; and it only permits suit by a personal representative for the benefit of surviving widow or husband and children if there be such (Chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657; chap. 143, 36 Stat. at L. 291, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8662). It is unnecessary to take up other points presented by counsel; the purpose and effect of the Federal legislation has been much discussed in our recent opinions. Pedersen v. Delaware, L. & W. R.

SONMAN SHAFT COAL CO.(1916)\nNo. 10\nArgued: May 14, 1915Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 120, 121]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis I. Gowen, John G. Johnson, and Frederic D. McKenney for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. A. M. Liveright and A. L. Cole for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n The coal company brought this action to recover damages from the railroad company upon two grounds: first, that for a period of four years, beginning April 1, 1903, the railroad company had failed to supply the coal company with a sufficient number of cars to meet the needs of the latter's coal mine; and, second, that during the same period the railroad company, in furnishing cars to the several mines in that district, had discriminated unjustly against the coal company and in favor of some of its competitors. The second ground was eliminated by the coal company at the trial, and does not require further notice. The action was begun in a state court and resulted in a \n\n[242 U.S. 120, 122]\n\u00a0\n judgment for the coal company for $145,830.25, which the supreme court of the state affirmed. 241 Pa. 487, 88 Atl. 746.\n The questions presented by the several assignments of error are: (1) What was the nature of the commerce involved? (2) If the commerce was interstate, was the action cognizable in a state court? (3) Was prejudicial error committed in excluding evidence presently to be mentioned?\n The coal company sold its coal f. o. b. cars at the mine, and when the cars were loaded, the coal was promptly forwarded to the purchasers at points within and without the state,-largely to points in other states. This was well understood by both companies,-by the coal company when it asked for cars and by the railroad company when it supplied them. Cars were not requested or furnished merely to be used in holding or storing coal, but always to be employed in its immediate transportation. While furnishing some cars for this service, the railroad company failed to furnish as many as the coal company needed and requested. It is plain that supplying the requisite cars was an essential step in the intended movement of the coal and a part of the commerce-whether interstate or intrastate-to which that movement belonged. It was expressly so held in Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Clark Bros. Coal Min. Co. \n238 U.S. 456\n, 465-468, 59 L. ed. 1406, 1410-1412, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896. We there said of the sale and delivery of coal f. o. b. at the mine for transportation to purchasers in other states: 'The movement thus initiated is an interstate movement and the facilities required are facilities of interstate commerce.' Here the state court ruled that, as the coal was sold f. o. b. at the mine, the commerce involved was intrastate, even though the coal was going to purchasers outside the state. This was error, but it plainly was without prejudice unless it led the state court to exercise a jurisdiction which it did not possess.\n In the courts below the railroad company contended that, in so far as the commerce involved was interstate, \n\n[242 U.S. 120, 123]\n\u00a0\n the action could not be entertained by a state court consistently with the Interstate Commerce Act, chap. 104, 24 Stat. at L. 379, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563, and that contention is renewed here. It proceeds upon the theory, first, that the coal company was without any right to redress in respect of its interstate business unless the failure to supply it with the requisite cars was a violation of some provision of that act; second, that  8 and 9 of the act prescribe the only modes of obtaining redress for violations of its provisions; and, third, that an action for damages in a state court is not among the modes prescribed.\n It is true that  8 and 9 deal with the redress of injuries resulting from violations of the act, and give the person injured a right either to make complaint to the Interstate Commerce Commission or to bring an action for damages in a Federal court, but not to do both. If the act said nothing more on the subject it well may be that no action for damages resulting from a violation of the act could be entertained by a state court. But the act shows that  8 and 9 do not completely express the will of Congress as respects the injuries for which redress may be had or the modes in which it may be obtained, for  22 contains this important provision: 'Nothing in this act contained shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this act are in addition to such remedies.' The three sections, if broadly construed, are not altogether harmonious, and yet it evidently is intended that all shall be operative. Only by reading them together and in connection with the act as a whole can the real purpose of each be seen. They often have been considered and what they mean has become pretty well settled. Thus we have held that a manifest purpose of the provision in  22 is to make it plain that such 'appropriate common law and statutory remedies' as can be enforced consistently with the scheme and purpose of the act are not abrogated or \n\n[242 U.S. 120, 124]\n\u00a0\n displaced (Texas & P.

Cas. 1075); that this provision is not intended to nullify other parts of the act, or to defeat rights or remedies given by earlier sections, but to preserve all existing rights not inconsistent with those which the act creates ( Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Puritan Coal Min. Co. \n237 \nU.S. 121, 129\n, 59 S. L. ed. 867, 872, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 484); that the act does not supersede the jurisdiction of state courts in any case, new or old, where the decision does not involve the determination of matters calling for the exercise of the administrative power and discretion of the Interstate Commerce Commission, or relate to a subject as to which the jurisdiction of the Federal courts is otherwise made exclusive (id. 130); that claims for damages arising out of the application, in interstate commerce, of rules for distributing cars in times of shortage, call for the exercise of the administrative authority of the Commission where the rule is assailed as unjustly discriminatory, but where the assault is not against the rule, but against its unequal and discriminatory application, no administrative question is presented and the claim may be prosecuted in either a Federal or a state court without any precedent action by the Commission (id. 131, 132); and that, if no administrative question be involved, as well may be the case, a claim for damages for failing upon reasonable request to furnish to a shipper in interstate commerce a sufficient number of cars to satisfy his needs may be enforced in either a Federal or a state court without any preliminary finding by the Commission, and this whether the carrier's default was a violation of its common-law duty existing prior to the Hepburn Act of 1906, or of the duty prescribed by that act1 (id. 132- 135; Eastern R. Co. v. Littlefield, \n237 \nU.S. 140, 143\n, 59 S. L. ed. 878, 882, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 489; Illinois C. R. Co. v. Mulberry \n\n[242 U.S. 120, 125]\n\u00a0\n Hill Coal Co. \n238 \nU.S. 275, 283\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1306, 1310, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 760; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Clark Bros. Coal Min. Co. \n238 \nU.S. 456, 472\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1406, 1413, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896).\n Applying these rulings to the case in hand, we are of opinion that a state court could entertain the action consistently with the Interstate Commerce Act. Not only does the provision in  22 make strongly for this conclusion, but a survey of the scheme of the act and of what it is intended to accomplish discloses no real support for the opposing view. With the charge of unjust discrimination eliminated, the ground upon which a recovery was sought was that for a period of four years, during which the conditions were normal, the carrier had failed upon reasonable demand to supply to a shipper in interstate commerce a sufficient number of cars to transport the output of the latter's coal mine. Assuming that the conditions were normal and the demand reasonable, it was the duty of the carrier to have furnished the cars. That duty arose from the common law up to the date of the amendatory statute of 1906, known as the Hepburn Act, and thereafter from a provision in that act which, for present purposes, may be regarded as merely adopting the common-law rule. There was evidence tending to show, and the jury found, that the conditions in the coal trade were normal and the demand for the cars reasonable. Indeed, without objection from the carrier, the court said when charging the jury; 'There is no testimony disputing the claim of the plaintiff that these were normal times.' The carrier insisted and the jury found that the carrier had a generally ample car supply for the needs of the coal traffic under normal conditions, and the jury further found that the failure to furnish the cars demanded was without justifiable excuse. Thus far it is apparent that no administrative question was involved,-nothing which the act intends shall be passed upon by the \n\n[242 U.S. 120, 126]\n\u00a0\n Commission either to the exclusion of the courts or as a necessary condition to judicial action.\n But there was testimony tending to show that the carrier was applying or following a rule for allotting cars which did not entitle the coal company to receive as many cars as it needed and requested, and because of this it is contended that the reasonableness of this rule was in issue and was an administrative question which the act intends that the Commission shall solve. We cannot accede to the contention. The conditions in the coal trade being normal, as just shown, the number of cars to which the coal company was entitled was to be measured by its reasonable requests based upon its actual needs. It is only in times of car shortage resulting from unusual demands or other abnormal conditions, not reasonably to have been foreseen, that car distribution rules originating with the carrier can be regarded as qualifying or affecting the right of a shipper to demand and receive cars commensurate in number with his needs. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Puritan Coal Min. Co. \n237 \nU.S. 121, 133\n, 59 S. L. ed. 867, 873, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 484. Such a rule being inapplicable in the conditions existing at the time, the rule mentioned in the testimony could not be a factor in the decision of the case, and whether in a time of unforeseen car shortage it would be reasonable or otherwise was not then material.\n Upon the trial carrier offered to prove by a witness then under examination 'that during all of the period of this action the defendant had in effect . . . through routes and joint rates to points outside the state of Pennsylvania on the lines of other common carriers; that it was obliged to permit cars loaded by its shippers with bituminous coal consigned to such points outside the state of Pennsylvania to go through to destination, even when on the lines of other railroad companies; that, as a result of doing this, it had continuously throughout the period of this action a large number of cars off its own lines \n\n[242 U.S. 120, 127]\n\u00a0\n and on the lines of other common carriers, which cars would otherwise have been available for shippers of coal on the railroad lines of the defendant, and these cars, if not on other railroad lines, would have increased the equipment available for distribution to the plaintiff's mine and would consequently have diminished the damage which plaintiff claims to have sustained by reason of the fact that it did not receive more cars than it did receive.'\n But on the coal company's objection the evidence was excluded. We think the ruling was right. The offer did not point to any unusual or abnormal condition, not reasonably to have been foreseen, but, on the contrary, to a situation which was described as continuous throughout the four-year period to which the action relates. It did not indicate that this condition was even peculiar to that period, or was caused by an extraordinary volume of coal traffic or an unusual detention of cars on other lines of railroad, or that it was other than a normal incident of the coal transportation in which the carrier was engaged. Without doubt the cars of this carrier when loaded with coal often went forward to destinations on the lines of other carriers. It is common knowledge that coal transportation has been conducted quite generally in this way for many years. Besides, a carrier extensively engaged in such transportation from mines along its lines, as this one was, naturally would expect to have a considerable number of cars on other lines in the ordinary course of business. Although possibly having a bearing upon the adequacy of the supply of cars provided by the carrier for the coal business as a whole,-a matter not within the contemplation of the offer,- it is certain that what was proposed to be proved had no tendency to show that the carrier had supplied to the coal company the number of cars to which it was entitled, or to mitigate the carrier's default in that regard.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 1. . . . and the term 'transportation' shall include cars and other vehicles and all instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage, . . .; and it shall be the duty of every carrier subject to the provisions of this act to provide and furnish such transportation upon reasonable request therefor, . . .' chap. 3591, 34 Stat. at L. 584, Comp.

McKenney for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. A. M. Liveright and A. L. Cole for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n In a state court in Pennsylvania the coal company recovered a judgment against the railroad company for damages resulting, as was claimed, from unjust discrimination practised in the distribution of coal cars in times of car shortage; and the supreme court of the state affirmed the judgment. 241 Pa. 509, 88 Atl. 761.\n The suit related to both intrastate and interstate commerce, and whether, in respect of the latter, it could be brought in a state court consistently with the Interstate Commerce Act is the first question presented.\n The coal company was engaged in coal mining on the carrier's line in Pennsylvania, and was shipping the coal to points in that and other states. Other coal companies were engaged in like operations in the same district. A \n\n[242 U.S. 298, 300]\n\u00a0\n rule of the carrier provided for a pro rata distribution of the available supply of coal cars in times of car shortage, but did not require or contemplate that individual cars, owned or controlled by the shipper, should be charged against his distributive share. Without questioning the reasonableness of this rule, but, on the contrary, assuming that it was unobjectionable and became the true measure of the shipper's right and the carrier's duty, the coal company claimed that the carrier had unjustly discriminated against it to its damage by furnishing it a smaller number of cars, and some of its competitors a greater number, than the rule contemplated or permitted. In other words, the claim was not that the rule was discriminatory, but that it was violated or unequally enforced by the carrier. Of such a suit was said in Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Puritan Coal Min. Co. \n237 \nU.S. 121, 131\n, 132 S., 59 L. ed. 867, 873, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 484, where the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act were extensively considered: 'There is no administrative question involved, the courts being called on to decide a mere question of fact as to whether the carrier has violated the rule to plaintiff's damage. Such suits, though against an interstate carrier for damages arising in interstate commerce, may be prosecuted either in the state or Federal courts.' Adhering to this view, we think the suit was properly brought in a state court. See Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Sonman Shaft Coal Co. \n242 U.S. 120\n, 61 L. ed. 188, 37 Sup. Ct. Rep. 46.\n But it is suggested that, in the course of the trial, an administrative question-one which the act intends the Interstate Commerce Commission shall solve-was brought into the suit, and that this disabled the court from proceeding to a decision upon the merits. The suggestion is grounded upon the fact that one of the carrier's defenses at the trial was to the effect that the rule invoked by the coal company as fixing its quota of the cars was unjustly discriminatory, and therefore not an appropriate test of the shipper's right or the carrier's duty. We think the \n\n[242 U.S. 298, 301]\n\u00a0\n suggestion is not well taken. The administrative question, which was whether the rule was reasonable or otherwise, was not then an open one. It had been theretofore determined in the mode contemplated by the act. Upon the complaint of other shippers, and after a full hearing, the Commission had found that the rule was unjustly discriminatory, and had directed the carrier to give no further effect to it. See Hillsdale Coal & Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 19 Inters. Com. Rep. 356; Jacoby v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 19 Inters. Com. Rep. 392, 23 Inters. Com. Rep. 186. Com. Rep. 392, 23 Inters. Com. Rep. 186. the Commission, which were produced in evidence. Thus there was no jurisdictional obstacle at this point.\n The Commission deemed it essential to a fair distribution in times of car shortage that individual cars, owned or controlled by the shipper, should be charged against his distributive share, and because the rule here took no account of such cars the Commission found that it was unjustly discriminatory. This occurred two years before the trial, but after the period covered by the suit. As part of its defense the carrier claimed that the cars distributed to the coal company during that period included many individual cars controlled by the latter, and that these were not charged against its distributive share. Evidently intending to recognize that this was so, and desiring to shorten the trial, the parties agreed that a verdict should be taken for the coal company in a designated sum, subject to the condition, among others, that 'if, under the practice, the law, and the rules,' the court should conclude that 'the plaintiff company should have been charged with individual cars,' then judgment should be entered for the carrier non obstante veredicto. The verdict was taken and judgment entered thereon, the court concluding that the rule should be respected notwithstanding the Commission's finding. Complaint is made of this decision, and we think it was wrong. That this shipper was not a party to the proceeding before the Commission hardly needs notice, no point being made of it in \n\n[242 U.S. 298, 302]\n\u00a0\n the briefs. And it is not a valid objection that the finding came after the period to which the suit relates. The act contemplated that the proceeding should be conducted in the interest of all the shippers who had been, or were likely to be, affected by the rule, and not merely in the interest of those who filed the complaint. The purpose was to determine the character of the rule for the equal benefit of all, to the end not only that discrimination thereunder in the future might be prevented, but also that such discrimination in the past might be redressed. So understanding the act, the Commission, upon finding the rule unjustly discriminatory, ordered the carrier to cease giving effect to it, and also recognized that shippers who had been injured through its operation in the past were entitled to reparation. And the Commission proceeded to award reparation to such shippers as appeared and adequately proved their injury and the amount of damages sustained. Not only so, but the Commission's report makes it plain that the finding was not based upon any temporary or changeable condition existing at the time, but upon what inhered in the rule, and therefore was true from the time of its adoption. The legal propriety of the Commission's finding is not questioned, but only that it operates to discredit the carrier's rule as respects earlier transactions.\n In the circumstances stated we are of opinion that effect must be given to the Commission's finding, even though it came after the transactions in question, and that a recovery by the coal company cannot be permitted without departing from the uniformity and equality of treatment which the act is intended to secure. Only through an enforcement of the discriminatory rule, and of the particular feature which made it discriminatory, can a recovery be had. A right to recover independently of that is neither shown nor claimed. In short, the coal company concedes that it received all the cars to which it would have been entitled under a reasonable rule, and yet seeks to recover \n\n[242 U.S. 298, 303]\n\u00a0\n upon the ground that more cars were not delivered to it under a rule which was unreasonable, because unduly discriminatory in its favor. Consistently with the act this cannot be done.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENNSYLVANIA R. CO. v. W F JACOBY & CO.(1916)\nNo. 22\nArgued: October 20, 1915Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 89, 90]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis I. Gowen, John G. Johnson, and Frederic D. McKenney for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.\n Mr. William A. Glasgow, Jr., for W. F. Jacoby & Company.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n Jacoby & Company, hereinafter called the plaintiffs, owned a coal mine known as Falcon No. 2 in the Clearfield district served by the Tyrone division of the lines of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, hereinafter called the company, and shipped coal from their mine in interstate commerce. In April, 1907, the plaintiffs made complaint before the Interstate Commerce Commission of discriminatory practices against them in the distribution of coal cars, in violation of the Act to Regulate Commerce. The Commission made findings, among others, that Falcon No. 2 was not placed on an equal footing with the mines of the Berwind-White Coal Company in the matter of the distribution of the defendant's available coal car equipment during the period of the action. It also found a special allotment of 500 cars daily to the Berwind-White Company to be an undue preference and discrimination, and on March 7th, 1910, the Commission made an order, finding that the complainants had been unduly discriminated against, and set forth that it appeared 'that it is and has been the defendant's rule, regulation, and practice, in distributing coal cars among the various coal operators on its lines for interstate shipments during percentage \n\n[242 U.S. 89, 91]\n\u00a0\n periods, to deduct the capacity in tons of foreign railway fuel cars, private cars, and system fuel cars, in the record herein referred to as 'assigned cars,' from the rated capacity in tons of the particular mine receiving such cars, and to regard the remainder as the rated capacity of that mine in the distribution of all 'unassigned' cars.' The Commission ordered 'that the said rule, regulation, and practice of the defendant in that behalf unduly discriminates against the complainants and other coal operators similarly situated and is in violation of the 3d section of the Act to Regulate Commerce . . . and that the defendant be, and it is hereby, notified and required, on or before the 1st day of November, 1910, to cease and desist from said practice and to abstain from maintaining and enforcing its present rules and regulations in that regard, and to cease and desist from any practice and to abstain from maintaining any rule or regulation that does not require it to count all such assigned cars against the regular rated capacity of the particular mine or mines receiving such cars in the same manner and to the same extent and on the same basis as unassigned cars are counted against the rated capacity of the mines receiving them.'\n At the same time, the Commission ordered that the question of damages sustained by the plaintiffs in respect to the matters and things in the report found to be discriminatory be deferred pending further argument. See also 19 Inters. Com. Rep. 392, where the decision is reported. In that case the Commission referred to its report filed the same day in the case of Hillsdale Coal & Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 19 Inters. Com. Rep. 356, in which the discriminatory character of the rules of car distribution of the company is fully discussed (page 364) and the rules are condemned, largely because of the advantages given to the owners of private cars unless the same shall be counted against the distributive share of the mine receiving them. See also the discussion of these rulings in \n\n[242 U.S. 89, 92]\n\u00a0\n Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Clark Bros. Coal Min. Co. \n238 U.S. 456\n, 59 L. ed. 1406, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896.\n On March 11, 1912, the Commission made a further report, in which it found as follows:\n'We find that by reason of the discriminations ascertained and set forth in our report in Jacoby v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 19 Inters. Com. Rep. 392, the complainants were damaged to the extent of $21,094.39, which they are entitled to recover with interest from June 28, 1907.\n\n'The claimants here demand $51,950.49. The award above made we base upon evidence adduced of record, from which we find:\n\n'(a) That the fair rating of the mine for the time in question, as fixed by the defendant and not objected to by the complainants, was 450 tons per day.\n\n'(b) That during the period from April, 1904, to March 31, 1905, the mine was operated 275 days; and that during the second period named on the exhibits, from April 1 to October 18, 1905, it was operated 138 1\/4 days.\n\n'(c) That during the first of these periods 38,714.23 tons were actually shipped from Falcon No. 2, and during the second period 17,973.88 tons; that if the complainants had received their fair share of the cars available for distribution the mine would have made additional interstate shipments and sales to the extent of 35,412.02 tons and 19,104.77 tons during the respective periods.\n\n'(d) That the average selling price of the complainants' product for the first period was $1.212 per ton, and in the second period $1.1670; that the cost of production, based on economical operation of the mine with a fair car supply, would have been 92 cents during the entire period of the action; and that the profit during the first period would therefore have been 29.2 cents and during the second period 24.7 cents per ton. This measures the loss on the tonnage which the complainant was unable to ship. \n\n[242 U.S. 89, 93]\n\u00a0\n '(e) That the actual cost of production is shown by the record as $1. 016 per ton during the first period and $1.049 per ton during the second period, making an excess of 9.6 cents and 12.9 cents for the respective periods in the actual cost of production under the conditions obtaining, as compared with what would have been the cost based on a fair car supply as heretofore stated. This is the basis adopted for computing the loss sustained by these complainants in diminished profits for the coal actually shipped during the period in question.'\n\n On March 11th, 1912, the Commission made a reparation order in favor of the plaintiffs, confirming its former orders, findings, and conclusions, and ordering that the company should pay to the plaintiffs on or before the 1st day of June, 1912, the sum of $21,094.39, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from June 28th, 1907, as reparation for defendant's discrimination in distribution of coal cars, which discrimination had been found by the Commission to be unlawful and unjust. Upon these orders of the Commission, suit was brought in the district court of the United States, for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, on July 19th, 1912, the action being based upon  16 of the Act to Regulate Commerce (34 Stat. at L. 590, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8584). The case was heard in the district court, and resulted in a verdict for the amount awarded by the Commission, with interest thereon. On the case going to the circuit court of appeals, that court certified certain questions to this court, and upon writ of certiorari the whole record was brought here.\n The case was argued before this court at the October term, 1915. At that term the judgment below was affirmed, with costs, by a divided court. Afterwards, and at the same term, a petition for rehearing was granted and the former judgment set aside, and the case restored to the docket for reargument. \n239 U.S. 631\n, 60 L. ed. 476, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 166.\n At the trial in the district court the plaintiffs offered \n\n[242 U.S. 89, 94]\n\u00a0\n no other testimony as to the amount of damages sustained by them than that contained in the orders of the Commission, before recited. Section 16 of the act makes the findings and orders of the Commission prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated, and it may be conceded that if no testimony was offered in the case to overcome the prima facie case thus made, the orders of the Commission would be controlling and determine the amount of recovery. The prima facie character of the findings of fact and award of damages by the Commission was established upon full consideration of the subject in Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co. \n236 U.S. 412\n, 426-431, 59 L. ed. 644, 656-658, P.U.R. 1915D, 1072, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 328, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 691, and second Meeker Case, \n236 U.S. 434\n, 59 L. ed. 659, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337. This court said in Mills v. Lehigh Valley R. Co. \n238 \nU.S. 473, 481\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1414, 1418, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 888, after quoting from the Meeker Cases supra: 'The statute was not concerned with mere forms of expression, and, in view of the decision that a finding of the ultimate fact of the amount of damage is enough to give the order of the Commission effect as prima facie evidence, we think the court did not err in its ruling. The statutory provision merely established a rule of evidence. It leaves every opportunity to the defendant to contest the claim.'\n In order to meet the prima facie case made by the plaintiffs upon the orders of the Commission in awarding damages, in the course of the testimony the company put in evidence certain sheets, which were offered in evidence before the Commission by the plaintiffs, in the hearing before that body, known as exhibit No. 10. These sheets were entitled, 'Detailed statements showing discrimination in favor of other mines and against Falcon No. 2 [the mine of the plaintiffs], from April 1st, 1904, to April 1st, 1905,' and 'from April 1st, 1905, to October 15th, 1905,' respectively, these being the periods for which recovery was sought in this case by the plaintiffs. These sheets undertook to show the percentage of cars awarded to certain preferred companies by the railroad company, as com- \n\n[242 U.S. 89, 95]\n\u00a0\n pared to those awarded to the plaintiffs for use in their mine during the period stated. They were intended to show that the favored companies received cars during the first period to the extent of 59.9 per cent of their mine rating, and during the second, 59.6 per cent of their mine ratings, which percentages were much larger than the plaintiffs received for their mine during the like periods. In other words, it was thus sought to establish that the favored mines received, not their just proportion of the distributable cars, but a much larger, and highly discriminatory share when compared with the allotment made to the plaintiffs. It is the contention of the company that it is demonstrable from this record that these tables showing the percentages awarded to favored companies were made the basis of the Commission's award of damages.\n We have already seen from the orders of the Commission, above recited, the manner in which it made its award and reached its conclusion as to the amount recoverable by the plaintiffs. At the trial in the district court, the Company placed a witness upon the stand, who testified as follows:\n Q. Referring to the order which has been put in evidence, made by the Interstate Commerce Commission, finding a certain amount as due Jacoby & Company, will you please say whether you have taken the daily rating fixed by the Commission as proper; namely, 450 tons per day, and multiply that by 275 days, the days which the Commission found the plaintiff's mine would have been able to work in the year ending March 31, 1905, and tell us what the aggregate number of tons is, based upon those two figures?\n A. 123,750 tons.\n Q. In that same order the Commission has found that the plaintiff shipped in that period 38,714.23 tons and that they ought to have received cars which would have enabled them to ship 35,412.02 tons additional. If they had made \n\n[242 U.S. 89, 96]\n\u00a0\n those additional shipments what would the total volume of shipments have been?\n A. 74,126.25 tons.\n Q. What percentage of the aggregate capacity of the mine, based upon 450 tons per day and 275 days, are the aggregate shipments which would have been made, which you have just spoken of?\n A. 59.9 per cent.\n Q. Coming to the second period of the action, the Commission found that 450 tons per day was a proper rating for the mine and that the mine would have been capable of working 138 1\/4 days. What, on that basis, is the aggregate capacity of the mine in that period?\n A. 62,212.51 tons.\n Q. In their order the Commission found that in that period the mine had shipped 17,973.88 tons and that it should have received cars which would have enabled it to ship 19,104.77 tons additional. If it had made those additional shipments, what would have been the total shipments in that period?\n A. 37,078.65 tons.\n Q. And what percentage is that of the aggregate rated capacity based on 450 tons a day and 138 1\/4 days?\n A. 59.6.\n This testimony was competent in order to meet the plaintiffs' case based on the orders of the Commission, and from it we think the conclusion is inevitable that the Commission may have used the percentages of 59.9 per cent and 59.6 per cent respectively in reaching the amount of damages awarded to the complainant. If so, the recovery was permitted, not upon the basis of damages sustained by reason of the illegal discrimination practised against the plaintiffs, as found by the Commission, but upon the basis that they were entitled to receive cars equal in ratio to those illegally and preferentially given to the certain favored companies named in the tables. The effect of \n\n[242 U.S. 89, 97]\n\u00a0\n the enforcement of such rule would be not to give the shipper the damages which he actually suffered, but would base the recovery upon a rule which is condemned as to others, because of its discrimination in their favor,-a result manifestly not intended by the act of Congress.\n The testimony being in the condition which we have stated, and the plaintiffs having offered no testimony to show the amount of damages sustained other than that contained in the order made by the Commission, the company made certain definite requests to charge, which were refused. In one of them, they requested a peremptory instruction in favor of the company upon the ground that as the award of the Interstate Commerce Commission was based upon the conclusion that, in the year ending April 1st, 1905, the plaintiffs should have received cars equal in capacity to 59.9 per cent of the aggregate of their daily mine rating for 275 days, and in the period between April 1st and October 18th, 1905, cars equal in capacity to 59.6 per cent of their daily mine rating for 138 1\/4 days, it was apparent that this conclusion of the Commission was based upon the evidence presented by the plaintiffs that the aggregate of the cars placed by the defendant at certain mines selected for the purpose of comparison from those comprised in the region in which the plaintiffs' mine was located had been equal in the earlier period to 59.9 per cent, and in the later period 59.6 per cent of the aggregate ratings of these selected mines. If the court should refuse to charge as above requested, the court was requested to instruct the jury as follows:\n'8. If the jury should find that the conclusion of the Interstate Commerce Commission that the plaintiffs, in the year ending April 1, 1905, should have received cars equal in capacity to 59.9 per cent of the aggregate of their daily mine ratings, and in the period between April 1 and October 18, 1905, cars equal in capacity to 59.6 per cent of the aggregate of their daily mine ratings, was reached or arrived \n\n[242 U.S. 89, 98]\n\u00a0\n at because of the evidence presented by the plaintiffs that the aggregate of the cars placed by the defendant at certain mines selected for the purpose of comparison from those comprised in the region in which the plaintiffs' mine was located had been equa' in the earlier period to 59.9 per cent and in the later period to 59.6 per cent of the aggregate ratings of these selected mines, the basis for the Commission's conclusion and award was an erroneous one, and the plaintiffs consequently are not entitled to recover.'\n\n In view of the testimony as we have already stated it, we think the company was entitled to have this eighth request given in charge to the jury. Nor do we think this refusal was cured by the charge that the finding of the Commission was prima facie correct, and entitled to weight as such unless the defendant produced evidence to show that some other state of facts existed, and that the plaintiffs had not suffered the damages awarded to them by the Commission, and the charge in general terms that it was the duty of the company to apportion and deliver to the plaintiffs their fair share of all cars available during the period of the action to shippers in the district in which plaintiffs' mine was located, and that, if plaintiffs received their full and proportionate share of cars in the district, they had no cause for complaint against the company, and the burden was upon the plaintiffs to establish by satisfactory proof that they did not receive their share; nor by other parts of the charge in which the jury was told in general terms that the shipper was entitled to recover the full amount of damages which he sustained, and that, in arriving at such damages, the jury could only take into consideration whether they had been discriminated against, and to what extent they were damaged by that discrimination, and that, if the Berwind-White Company got 59 per cent of its output when the average allottable was 28 per cent, it did not necessarily follow that the plaintiffs would be damaged the entire difference between \n\n[242 U.S. 89, 99]\n\u00a0\n 28 per cent and 59 per cent, but their damage would be the amount to which their number of cars was reduced in the general allotment by favoring somebody else and taking the cars from them. However correct these general observations may have been, we think it was error in the state of the record to which we have already referred to refuse the specific charge requested.\n It is urged that the testimony before the Commission is not all in the record, and that, for aught that appears, the Commission may have reached its conclusion and awarded damages upon other and competent proofs, and it is insisted that the coincidence of the amount as awarded and the amount ascertained by the use of the percentages contained in the tables may not necessarily have controlled the action of the Commission. But it is difficult to reach the conclusion that the Commission could have arrived at the result so exactly corresponding with the one obtained by the use of the percentages shown in the tables, except by actually using them to ascertain the sum which is exactly the amount resulting from their application. The Commission might have approximated the same result by using other and legal means to ascertain the damages sustained, but when it is demonstrated that the use of the percentages precisely produces the amount awarded to the dollar and cent, it seems almost mathematically certain that the result could have been reached in no other way. At least, we think that the testimony was in such shape that, as we have already said, the company was entitled to the specific request upon this subject submitting the matter to the jury.\n For error in refusing to give this request in charge, the judgment of the District Court must be reversed, and the case remanded to that court for a new trial.\nREVERSED.\n Dissenting, Mr. Justice Pitney. \n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK EX REL KENNEDY v.

After that event, it was again considered, and was re-adopted.\n Fayette Kennedy, Warren Kennedy, and Willis White, Jr., three Seneca Indians, residing on the Cattaraugus Reservation, under the charge of an Indian agent of the United States, were arrested for spearing fish in Eighteen Mile creek, in Erie county, state of New York, at a place outside the Reservation, and there having certain fish in their possession, in violation of  176 of the conservation law of that state. A justice of the peace committed them to the custody of the sheriff, and a writ of habeas corpus was sued out upon the ground that the commitment was invalid. It was alleged that the persons arrested were tribal Indians, as above stated, and that the place where the offense was committed was within the territory included in 'certain grants . . . under sanction of the United States of America, whereby . . . the right was reserved to the said Indians to fish in the waters on and in said lands.' The supreme court, at special term, discharged the petitioners, holding that the ancient grants, agreements, and the treaties mentioned, and \n\n[241 U.S. 556, 560]\n\u00a0\n particularly the treaty made between the Seneca Nation of Indians and Robert Morris, in the year 1797, permitted these Indians to fish in the waters in question 'at will, and at all seasons of the year, regardless of the provisions of the game laws of the state of New York.' The appellate division of the supreme court, fourth department, reversed the order, and remanded the three Indians to custody (165 App. Div. 881, 151 N. Y. Supp. 138); and the order of the appellate division was affirmed by the court of appeals. The court entertained the Federal question presented, and decided that the state law, notwithstanding the treaty, was applicable. 215 N. Y. 42, 109 N. E. 116.\n Section 176 of the conservation law of New York prohibits the taking of fish, or having the same in possession, except as permitted by the article of which it is a part. The validity of these provisions with respect to those subject to the jurisdiction of the state is not questioned. The controversy relates solely to the state power over these Indians.\n The argument for the plaintiffs in error has taken a wide range, and embraces an extended history of the dealings with the Six Nations. We do not find it to be necessary to review this interesting history, as the question to be determined is a narrow one. The locus in quo is within the state of New York, being within 1 mile from the point where Eighteen Mile creek empties into Lake Erie. It is not within the territorial limits of the Indian Reservation on which the Senecas reside. It is within the territory which was ceded by the Seneca Nation to Robert Morris by the treaty of the 'Big Tree,' of September 15, 1797 (7 Stat. at L. 601), and the question turns upon the construction of this treaty; that is, on the consequences which attached to the reservation therein of fishing and hunting rights upon the lands then granted. These lands were a part of the tract covered by the compact made in 1786 between the state of New York and the \n\n[241 U.S. 556, 561]\n\u00a0\n commonwealth of Massachusetts, known as the Hartford convention. (Journals of Congress, vol. 4, p. 787.) By the terms of this compact for the settlement of existing controversies, Massachusetts ceded, granted, and released to New York all its 'claim, right, and title' to the 'government, sovereignty, and jurisdiction' of the lands, while New York ceded, granted, and released to Massachusetts 'the right of pre-emption of the soil from the native Indians, and all other the estate, right, title, and property' which the state of New York had. Subsequently Massachusetts sold to Robert Morris its 'pre-emptive right.' By  12 of the Federal Indian intercourse act of May 19, 1796 (1 Stat. at L. 469, 472, chap. 30), it was provided that no conveyance of lands 'from any Indian, or nation or tribe of Indians,' should be valid unless 'the same be made by treaty or convention, entered into pursuant to the Constitution;' and this was subject to a proviso as to the proposal and adjustment of compensation by state agents in the presence and with the approval of commissioners of the United States. The lands in question were accordingly conveyed to Robert Morris by the treaty above mentioned. From the preamble (as shown by the original on file in the State Department, a copy of which has been produced by the government) it appears that the conveyance was made under the authority of the United States, and in the presence of the United States commissioner, and the treaty was proclaimed by the President after ratification by the Senate on April 11, 1798. The convention is in the form of an indenture by which (identifying the tract as being part of that embraced in tne Hartford convention) these lands were granted by the sachems, chiefs, and warriors of the Seneca Nation to Robert Morris, 'his heirs and assigns forever.' The lands-which were soon resold-thus passed by the conveyance into private ownership, and were subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the \n\n[241 U.S. 556, 562]\n\u00a0\n state of New York. The grant contained the following reservation, which is in question here:-'Also, excepting and reserving to them, the said parties of the first part and their heirs, the privilege of fishing and hunting on the said tract of land hereby intended to be conveyed.'\n The right thus reserved was not an exclusive right. Those to whom the lands were ceded, and their grantees, and all persons to whom the privilege might be given, would be entitled to hunt and fish upon these lands, as well as the Indians of this tribe. And, with respect to this nonexclusive right of the latter, it is important to observe the exact nature of the controversy. It is not disputed that these Indians reserved the stated privilege both as against their grantees and all who might become owners of the ceded lands. We assume that they retained an easement, or profit a prendre, to the extent defined; that is not questioned. The right asserted in this case is against the state of New York. It is a right sought to be maintained in derogation of the sovereignty of the state. It is not a claim for the vindication of a right of private property against any injurious discrimination, for the regulations of the state apply to all persons equally. It is the denial with respect to these Indians, and the exercise of the privilege reserved, of all state power of control or reasonable regulation as to lands and waters otherwise admittedly within the jurisdiction of the state.\n It is not to be doubted that the power to preserve fish and game within its borders is inherent in the sovereignty of the state (Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 U.S. 519\n, 40 L. ed. 793, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 600; Ward v. Race Horse, \n163 \nU.S. 504, 507\n, 41 S. L. ed. 244, 245, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1076), subject, of course, to any valid exercise of authority under the provisions of the Federal Constitution. It is not denied-save as to the members of this tribe-that this inherent power extended over the locus in quo and to all persons attempting there to hunt or fish, whether they are owners of the lands or others. The contention for the plaintiffs in error must, and does, \n\n[241 U.S. 556, 563]\n\u00a0\n go to the extent of insisting that the effect of the reservation was to maintain in the tribe sovereignty quoad hoc. As the plaintiffs in error put it: 'The land itself became thereby subject to a joint property ownership and the dual sovereignty of the two peoples, white and red, to fit the case intended, however infrequent such situation was to be.' We are unable to take this view. It is said that the state would regulate the whites and that the Indian tribe would regulate its members, but if neither could exercise authority with respect to the other at the locus in quo, either would be free to destroy the subject of the power. Such a duality of sovereignty, instead of maintaining in each the essential power of preservation, would in fact deny it to both.\n It has frequently been said that treaties with the Indians should be construed in the sense in which the Indians understood them. But it is idle to suppose that there was any actual anticipation at the time the treaty was made of the conditions now existing, to which the legislation in question was addressed. Adopted when game was plentiful,-when the cultivation contemplated by the whites was not expected to interfere with its abundance,-it can hardly be supposed that the thought of the Indians was concerned with the necessary exercise of inherent power under modern conditions for the preservation of wild life. But the existence of the sovereignty of the state was well understood, and this conception involved all that was necessarily implied in that sovereignty, whether fully appreciated or not. We do not think that it is a proper construction of the reservation in the conveyance to regard it as an attempt either to reserve sovereign prerogative, or so to divide the inherent power of preservation as to make its competent exercise cise impossible. Rather are we of the opinion that the clause is fully satisfied by considering it a reservation of a privilege of fishing and hunting upon the granted lands in common with the \n\n[241 U.S. 556, 564]\n\u00a0\n grantees, and others to whom the privilege might be extended, but subject, nevertheless, to that necessary power of appropriate regulation, as to all those privileged, which inhered in the sovereignty of the state over the lands where the privilege was exercised. This was clearly recognized in United States v. Winans, \n198 \nU.S. 371, 384\n, 49 S. L. ed. 1089, 1093, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 662, where the court, in sustaining the fishing rights of the Indians on the Columbia river, under the provisions of the treaty between the United States and the Yakima Indians, ratified in 1859 [12 Stat. at L. 951], said (referring to the authority of the state of Washington): 'Nor does it' (that is, the right of 'taking fish at all usual and accustomed places') 'restrain the state unreasonably, if at all, in the regulation of the right. It only fixes in the land such easements as enable the right to be exercised.'\n We have assumed the applicability of the state law in question, as its construction is determined by the decision of the state court. We also assume that these Indians are wards of the United States, under the care of an Indian agent; but this fact does not derogate from the authority of the state, in a case like the present, to enforce its laws at the locus in quo. Ward v. Race Horse and United States v. Winans, supra. There is no question of conflict with any legislation of Congress or with action under its authority; for the case rests on the construction of the treaty. The only action of Federal authority, that is pertinent, is found in the convention itself. It should be added that we have not considered any question relating to conduct or fishing rights upon territory, not ceded, which is comprised within the Indian Reservation; nor is it necessary to deal with other matters which have been discussed in argument touching the relation of the state of New York to the Indians within its borders.\n We find no error in the judgment of the state court, and it is accordingly affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Leave granted to present a petition for rehearing herein within sixty days if counsel are so afvised, on motion of Solicitor General Davis for the United States.\n June 12, 1916. \n\n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPHILADELPHIA & R R.

L. ed. 1267, 1271, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 867.\n In November, 1912, the Allentown Portland Cement Company filed a petition before the Interstate Commerce Commission against the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, Delaware, Lackawanna, & Western Railroad Company, Erie Railroad Company, and Pennsylvania Railroad Company, wherein it alleged the Philadelphia & Reading operates the only line reaching its plant at Evansville, Pennsylvania, and in connection with other defendants transports cement therefrom to many points, including Jersey City; \n\n[240 U.S. 334, 337]\n\u00a0\n that the published rate of $1.35 per ton charged and collected for transportation to the latter place is unlawful and forbidden by  1 and 3 of the act to regulate commerce.* It prayed for 'an order declaring the rates aforesaid to be unjust and unreasonable and that the same discriminate against complainant and the locality wherein is located its plant or factory aforesaid, and that the Commission will also enter an order fixing the reasonable and just rates for the transportation of Portland Cement from its factory or plant at Evansville, over the lines of the defendant.' After hearing, a report and order were made by the Commission; upon rehearing the original findings were approved in an additional report, and a supplemental order, not substantially different from the first one, was passed. The material portions of these reports follow:\n'The case involves the question of the reasonableness and justness of defendants' rate for the transportation of cement in car loads from Evansville, Pennsylvania, to Jersey City, New Jersey. Evansville is reached only by the Philadelphia & Reading Railway. That carrier transports the cement in question from Evansville to Allentown, where it delivers it to one of numerous connections which either transports it to Jersey City or in turn delivers it to other carriers for final delivery at Jersey City. The rates via these various routes is $1.35. Certain of the carriers which receive this Evansville cement from the Philadelphia & Reading at Allentown also serve other mills in the same general vicinity at Allentown, namely, the Lehigh district, either directly or through connections. The rate from these other mills to Jersey City is 80 cents. The Philadelphia & Reading does not participate in the 80-cent rate from any mill in the district.' (31 Inters. Com. Rep. 277.)\n\n'Evansville is situated in the Lehigh district and is one of numerous cement producing points in that district located within a radius of perhaps 20 miles of each other. None of the other mills, however, are reached by the Philadelphia-\n\n * Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 380 (Comp. St. 1913,  8563, 8565). \n\n[240 U.S. 334, 338]\n\u00a0\n & Reading, they being served by the Central Railroad of New Jersey or Lehigh Valley direct, or by short lines of railway which connect with those carriers at distances of from 1 to 16 miles from their junction points. While the rate to Jersey City is thus $1.35 from Evansville on the Philadelphia & Reading, the rate to Jersey City from these competing mills on other lines is 80 cents. . . . On shipments to Jersey City for trans- shipment by water to points in the southeast, such as Charleston and Savannah, the rate is 80 cents from Evansville, the same as it is from these other mills; and this equality of Evansville with the other mills is maintained on traffic to Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York city, and New England. In other words, the rate is the same from Evansville as from other mills in the Lehigh district to all points east, except on traffic to Jersey City for local consumption.\n'The 80-cent rate to Jersey City locally from the other mills is used in connection with shipments destined to New York, that rate plus the trucking charge to all points south of Ninetieth street totaling less than the $1.40 rate to New York proper plus the trucking charge to the same point, the result being that complainant, who must use the latter rate, is effectively barred from competition in that part of the city located south of Forty-third street, which is the greatest Cement consuming district. North of Ninetieth street complainant can compete with the other mills because of their greater expense in the longer truck haul from Jersey City. It will also necessarily be apparent that complainant cannot sell any cement in Jersey City for local consumption in competition with these other mills which have the 80-cent rate.'\n\n'It cannot be questioned that complainant is laboring under a prohibitory disadvantage in marketing its product in Jersey City under the present rate in competition with other mills in the same district. While it is true that the Philadelphia & Reading does not have any hand in the \n\n[240 U.S. 334, 339]\n\u00a0\n establishment of the 80-cent rate from these other mills, as it cannot participate in that traffic because it does not serve them, it is also true that it is a party to tariffs under which cement may be purchased as cheaply at Evansville as at neighboring mills in the Lehigh district by dealers in and consumers of cement at practically all points of importance east of that district, with the single execption of Jersey City. Why Jersey City should be singled out by that carrier as the one exception to this equalization of rates as between competing mills in the same district has not been satisfactorily shown by this record. We are therefore of opinion, and find, that in maintaining or participating in rates on cement in carloads to other eastern destinations, such as Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and New England points, which are not higher from Evansville than the contemporaneous rates which it maintains or participates in from other mills in the Lehigh district, while refusing contemporaneously to participate in the same relative adjustment from Evansville to Jersey City, the Philadelphia & Reading, as well as the other carriers defendant, are subjecting Jersey City and its traffic to an undue prejudice and disadvantage, from which an order will be entered to cease and desist.' ( 27 Inters. Com. Rep. 448.)\n\n Purporting to base its action on the foregoing findings, the Commission directed:\n'That the above-named defendants, according as their various lines or routes may run, be, and they are hereby, notified and required, on or before October 1, 1914, to cease and desist from said undue and unreasonable prejudices and disadvantages.'\n\n'That said defendants, according as their various lines or routes may run, be, and they are hereby notified and required to establish on or before October 1, 1914, upon statutory notice to the Interstate Commerce Commission and to the general public by filing and posting in the manner \n\n[240 U.S. 334, 340]\n\u00a0\n prescribed in  6 of the act to regulate commerce, and for a period of two years after said October 1, 1914, to maintain and apply to said transportation rates which will prevent and avoid the aforesaid undue and unreasonable prejudices and disadvantages.'\n\n Undue discrimination against itself of the locality of its plant, as alleged by the cement company, was not found; the community declared to be prejudiced by established conditions had offered no complaint and was not party to the proceedings. Neither the $1.35 rate to Jersey City nor any other participated in by the Philadelphia & Reading was declared unreasonable, either in itself or in relation to others; and there was no positive finding touching the reasonableness-intrinsic or relative-of the 80-cent schedule from 'Lehigh district' adopted by the remaining carriers.\n In their brief here, counsel for the Commission say:\n'The Commission did not pass upon the reasonableness of either rate [ to Jersey City-80 cents or $1.35]. It struck at the discrimination and the cause of it. It said, in effect, to these five carriers, that as they treated the Lehigh cement district as one point of origin and made a relative adjustment of rates on cement to all the principle consuming points competing with Jersey City, they must make the same adjustment of the rates to Jersey City on this commodity; that they might make the rate any sum which they might choose to initiate, but that it must be the same as the rate from every mill in the district to Jersey City. . . .'\n\n'If, as to all other consuming localities, they [the carriers] are giving the relative adjustment of rates on cement from cement mills in the Lehigh district, and refusing this adjustment to one consuming locality, they are prejudicing that locality. . . .'\n\n'The establishment of joint rates is provided for in  6 of the act to regulate commerce. Such rates \n\n[240 U.S. 334, 341]\n\u00a0\n are made by agreement between the participating carriers and cannot not be filed or published without such agreement. . . .'\n\n'The appellant has no individual rate which covers the cement traffic from Evansville to Jersey City; the traffic moves on a joint rate. The cement traffic from other mills to Jersey City and to other principal consuming points also moves on joint rates. The Philadelphia & Reading is a party to many of these rates. It is also a party to the joint rate from Evansville to Jersey City. As a participating carrier in these rates it is responsible for the violation of the act described in the order.'\n\n We must assume the Jersey City rate of $1.35 is intrinsically reasonable and nondiscriminatory in relation to those accorded other consuming points; and, plainly, if this were put in by all carriers, the Commission's order would be complied with and the supposed discrimination disappear. It must be taken as true that no rate above what all might lawfully establish is being demanded by any carrier; and, with one exception, they are paid 40 per cent less than that amount. If a universal rate of $1.35 could not justly be complained of by the locality, certainly it is not discriminated against or unlawfully prejudiced because, failing to agree, most of the carriers have established an 80-cent schedule. In the circumstances disclosed it is impossible rightly to conclude that Jersey City is being subjected to 'any undue of unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.'\n As the facts reported afford no foundation for the Commission's findings, enforcement of the order based thereon must be enjoined. The decree below is accordingly reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPINEL v.

C. Stanley for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a direct appeal under  238, Judicial Code (36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1215), from an order dismissing a bill of complaint for want of jurisdiction. There are two complainants, and the jurisdictional questions certified are, (1) whether the amount in controversy is sufficient to give the court jurisdiction, and (2) whether the parties are collusively joined.\n It is averred in the bill that complainants and defendants are the children of one Charles T. Pinel, a resident of the state of Michigan, who died June 26, 1888, possessed in fee simple of a tract of land situate in that state, and leaving a last will and testament which was afterwards duly admitted to probate there, by which he left his entire estate to the defendants, failing to provide for complainants, who are two of his children, and for another child, Charles W. Pinel; that their omission from the will was not intentional on the part of the said Charles T. Pinel, but was made by a mistake or accident; that the laws of the state of Michigan (Comp. Laws 1897,  9286) \n\n[240 U.S. 594, 596]\n\u00a0\n provide that when any testator shall omit to provide in his will for any of his children, and it shall appear that such omission was not intentional and was made by mistake or accident, such child shall have the same share in the estate of the testator as if he had died intestate; that by virtue of the statute complainants and the said Charles W. Pinel were severally entitled to the same shares in the estate of Charles T. Pinel, deceased, as if he had died intestate; that testator left a widow and nine children, one of whom is since deceased; that after testator's death Charles W. Pinel conveyed all his interest in the estate to the complainant Sarah Slyfield; and that, by reason of the premises, 'complainant Herman Pinel is entitled to an undivided one-eighth interest, and complainant Sarah Slyfield to an undivided two-eighths interest, or in all both complainants together to an undivided three-eighths interest in the aforesaid property, which said interests are of the value of $4,500 and upwards over and above all encumbrances.' The prayer is, in effect, that the title of complainants to an undivided three-eighths interest in the land may be established.\n The settled rule is that when two or more plaintiffs having separate and distinct demands unite in a single suit, it is essential that the demand of each be of the requisite jurisdictional amount; but when several plaintiffs unite to enforce a single title or right in which they have a common and undivided interest, it is enough if their interests collectively equal the jurisdictional amount.

This case comes within the former class, since the title of each complainant is separate and distinct from that of the other; it being evident that the testator's omission to provide for one of his children by will, based upon mistake or accident, is independent of the question whether a like mistake was made with respect to another child. \n\n[240 U.S. 594, 597]\n\u00a0\n The action having been brought in the district court under the first paragraph of  24, Judicial Code (act of March 3, 1911, chap. 231, 36 Stat. at L. 1087, 1091, Comp. Stat. 1913,  991), on the ground of diversity of citizenship, it is necessary that the matter in controversy exceed the sum or value of $3,000, and that this shall appear by distinct averment upon the face of the bill, or otherwise from the proofs. The averment that complainant Pinel is entitled to an undivided one-eighth interest, and complainant Slyfield to an undivided two-eighths interest, making together an undivided three-eighths interest in the property in question, 'which said interests are of the value of $4,500 and upwards over and above all encumbrances,' is not the legal equivalent of saying that the interest of either complainant is of the value of more than $3,000. It is not necessarily to be inferred that the value of an undivided two-eighths is two-thirds of the value of an undivided three-eighths. The probable cost and difficulty of partition, and other like considerations, prevent the application of a mere rule of proportion. Affidavits were submitted pro and con upon the motion to dismiss, but they do not help matters. Complainants submitted five affidavits, all in a stereotyped form and based on information and belief, stating that the value of the farm as a whole is $15,000 and upwards, but saying nothing about encumbrances, nor stating distinctly the value of an undivided one-eighth or two-eighths interest. Defendants submitted four affidavits valuing the farm at not more than $9,000 if free and clear of encumbrances, but showing it encumbered to an amount upwards of $3,500. Were we to accept the highest valuation stated by anybody ($15,000) and deduct from it the amount of undisputed encumbrances, we should have a net valuation less than $11,500. Assuming undivided shares to be of proportionate value, a two-eighths interest would be worth less than $3,000.\n Upon the whole, it does not satisfactorily appear that \n\n[240 U.S. 594, 598]\n\u00a0\n the interest claimed by either complainant is sufficient in value to confer jurisdiction, and hence the bill was properly dismissed. It is obvious that, in the view we take of the case, the question of collusive joinder becomes immaterial.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPITNEY v. STATE OF WASHINGTON(1916)\nNo. 242\nArgued: Decided: March 6, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. Louis Marshall and Sol. M. Stroock for plaintiff in error. \n\n[240 U.S. 387, 388]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. D. V. Halverstadt, Blackburn Esterline, Alfred H. Lundin, and Mr. W. V.

L. ed . --, --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 370, 379]. It was argued and submitted with those cases and involves the same general questions and the validity of the statute passed upon in No. 224.\n A criminal information was filed in the superior court of the state of Washington for the county of King, charging that the United Cigar Stores Company, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, doing business in the state of Washington, owned and conducted a certain store and place of business in the city of Seattle, and had not then or theretofore obtained a separate license from the auditor of the county entitling it at its store and place of business to use or furnish to other persons, etc., to use, in, with, or for the sale of any goods, etc., any stamps, etc., or other similar devices, entitling the purchaser receiving the same to procure from any person, etc., any goods, etc., free of charge or for less than the retail price thereof upon the production of any number of said stamps, etc.\n That Pitney (plaintiff in error), at said place of business, \n\n[240 U.S. 387, 389]\n\u00a0\n well knowing the above facts, did then and there unlawfully, as the manager, servant, and agent of the United Cigar Stores Company, Inc., use and furnish in, with, and in connection with the sale of certain goods, etc., to one John Garvin a certain stamp, etc., of the following tenor:\n No. 139,198. Dr.\n United Cigar Stores Company (Incorporated).\n Certificate.\n Cash value at any Profit-Sharing Station in the state of Washington, 1 cent, but average merchandise value, according to profit-sharing list, 2 cents.\n This certificate represents a 25-cent purchase, and is redeemable according to the conditions of our profit-sharing list.

Redeemable only by the person to whom originally issued.\n United Cigar Stores Company (Incorporated)\n Largest Cigar Retailers in the world.\n And it was alleged that Garvin received the same.\n A demurrer was filed to the information, the grounds of which were, as alleged, that the defendant had not violated any law, that the information failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a crime or misdemeanor, and that it did not charge any offense against the laws of Washington. The demurrer was sustained and the case dismissed. This action was reversed by the supreme court of the state and the cause remanded with directions to overrule the demurrer. 79 Wash. 608, 140 Pac. 918.\n Upon the return of the case to the superior court the demurrer was overuled and defendant pleaded guilty. He then moved in arrest of judgment, invoking against the law and sentence under it articles 5 and 8 of the Constitution of the United States and  1 of the 14th Amendment of that Constitution.\n It was stipulated that Pitney, as charged, furnished Garvin a certain stamp, etc., which entitled Garvin to procure from the United Cigar Stores Co., Inc., upon the \n\n[240 U.S. 387, 390]\n\u00a0\n production of a certain specified number of such stamps, etc., or other similar device, certain goods, etc., free of charge; that the stamp, etc., so delivered to Garvin, was redeemable by the company alone, and entitled him to receive from the company, and from no other, such goods, etc.; that the stamp, etc., was by its terms redeemable in goods, etc., or 1 cent in cash, at the option of the holder, as provided by the laws of the state of Washington. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Judgment of a fine of $10 and costs was pronounced against him, which was affirmed by the supreme court for the reasons announced in its former opinion. The case was then brought here by writ of error allowed by the chief justice of the state.\n The court overruled Leonard v. Bassindale, 46 Wash. 301, 89 Pac. 879, in which case it had decided that the law, passed in 1905, prohibiting the use of trading stamps, was unconstitutional, giving as reason that the police power of the state, as expounded and illustrated by the decisions of this court, was legally exercised in the passage of the statute.\n The reasons and conclusion of the court are combated \n\n[240 U.S. 387, 391]\n\u00a0\n by plaintiff in error by the same considerations and arguments that were advanced in Nos. 41 and 224. What we said in answer to them there we need not repeat here, and upon the authority of those cases the judgment of the Supreme Court must be, and it is, affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The law of Washington, passed in 1907 (Laws 1907, p. 742), provided:\n ( 1) That no stamps, etc., or other similar device which should entitle the holder thereof to receive from the vendor or indirectly through any other person, money or goods, etc., should be sold or issued unless each of the stamps, etc., should have legibly printed or written upon the face thereof the redeemable value thereof in cents.\n ( 2) That such stamps, etc., should be redeemable in goods, etc., 'or in cash, good and lawful money of the United States, at the option of the holder thereof,' and any number of such stamps, etc., should be redeemed at the value thereof in cents printed on the face thereof, and it should not be necessary for the holder thereof to have any stipulated number of the same.\n ( 3) That in case of refusal to redeem the stamps, etc., the vendor or such other person should be liable to the holder thereof for the face value thereof.\n ( 4) Violation of the act is made a misdemeanor. \n\n\n\n\n","155":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPORTUGUESE-AMERICAN BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO v.

The district court approved the report of the referee against the claim and in favor of the appellant, but this decree was reversed by the circuit court of appeals. 128 C. C. A. 161, 211 Fed. 561; 131 C. C. A. 389, 215 Fed. 81. The subject- matter is the fourth progress payment, which, on December 5, 1910, had been authorized by the board of public works of the city. On that day the Construction Company applied to the appellant bank for a loan of $30,000, secured by an order on the auditor of the city, authorizing the bank to draw from the city for the above and other amounts not in controversy here. The bank declined until the order should be accepted by the auditor, whereupon, on the next day, the order was presented to the auditor's office and stamped as received on December 6. The order was intended and taken as an assignment, and, after it had been stamped, was accepted by the bank as security and the money was advanced. The next day $5,000 more was advanced on the same security, notes being given for each sum. The appellee Welles was a subcontractor, and on December 12 and 16 served notice on the city to withhold payment, as permitted by  1184 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the state of California. It is admitted by Welles that if the assignment was valid, his rights are subordinate to it ( Newport Wharf & Lumber Co. v. Drew, 125 Cal. 585, 58 Pac. 187); and the only question argued on his behalf is whether the terms of the contract between the bankrupt and the city made the assignment void.\n The contract provided that the contractor should keep the work under his personal control, and should not assign or sublet the whole or any part thereof without the consent of the board of public works. It further declared that no subcontract should relieve the contractor of any \n\n[242 U.S. 7, 11]\n\u00a0\n of his obligations, and that he should not, 'either legally or equitably, assign any of the moneys payable under the contract or his claim thereto unless with the like consent.' The city has made no objection to the assignment to the bank, and the money now awaits the decision of this court as between the claimant of the lien and the prior assignee.\n There is a logical difficulty in putting another man into the relation of the covenantee to the covenantor, because the facts that give rise to the obligation are true only of the covenantee,-a difficulty that has been met by the fiction of identity of person and in other ways not material here. Of course, a covenantor is not to be held beyond his undertaking, and he may make that as narrow as he likes. Arkansas Valley Smelting Co. v. Belden Min. Co. \n127 U.S. 379\n, 32 L. ed. 246, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1308. But when he has incurred a debt, which is property in the hands of the creditor, it is a different thing to say that, as between the creditor and a third person, the debtor can restrain his alienation of that, although he could not forbid the sale or pledge of other chattels. When a man sells a horse, what he does, from the point of view of the law, is to transfer a right, and a right being regarded by the law as a thing, even though a res incorporalis, it is not illogical to apply the same rule to a debt that would be applied to a horse. It is not illogical to say that the debt is as liable to sale as it is to the acquisition of a lien. To be sure, the lien is allowed by a statute subject to which the contract was made, but the contract was made subject also to the common law, and if the common law applies the principle recognized by the statute of California that a debt is to be regarded as a thing, and therefore subjects it to the ordinary rules in determining the relative rights of an assignee and the claimant of a lien, it does nothing of which the debtor can complain. See further, Cal. Civ. Code,  954, 711. The debtor does not complain, but stands \n\n[242 U.S. 7, 12]\n\u00a0\n indifferent, willing that the common law should take its course.\n The circuit court of appeals relied largely upon Burck v. Taylor, \n152 U.S. 634\n, 38 L. ed. 578, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 696, some expressions in which, at least, seem to warrant the conclusion reached. But that case, as understood by the majority of the court, was quite different from this. A contract for the building of the Capitol of Texas was made not assignable without the consent of the governor and certain others. The contractor assigned an undivided three-fourths interest to Taylor, Babcock, & Company, with the required assent, and then three sixteenths without assent to three others severally, one of whom conveyed one thirty-second to the plaintiff. The contractor made another conveyance of all his rights under the contract to Taylor, Babcock, & Company, and Taylor, Babcock, & Company made what purported to be a transfer of the entire contract to Abner Taylor, the defendant. Both of these transfers were assented to. In the latter, Taylor purported to bind himself to the state to perform the original contract, and, in the assent to the same, the governor and other authorities stated that they recognized Taylor as the contractor, bound as the original contractor was bound. The court held that there was a novation (p. 650), and that Taylor acted without notice of the plaintiff's claim (p. 653). Upon those facts it would be hard to make out any right of the plaintiff to proceeds of the new contract that Taylor had performed.\n The assignability of a debt incurred under a contract like the present sometimes is sustained on the ground that the provision against assignment is inserted only for the benefit of the city. Whether that form of expression is accurate or merely is an indirect recognition of the principle that we have stated hardly is material here. It is enough to say that we are of opinion that, upon the facts stated, the assignment was not absolutely void, that therefore the bank got a title prior to that of Welles, and con- \n\n[242 U.S. 7, 13]\n\u00a0\n sequently that the decree must be reversed.

The tax upon wholesale dealers is $1.50 upon each $1, 000. The statute has this proviso:\n'Provided, further, That each and every person, firm or corporation, who shall offer with merchandise bargained or sold in the course of trade any coupon, profit-sharing certificate, or other evidence of indebtedness or liability, redeemable in premiums, shall pay annually a state license tax of five hundred ($500) dollars and a county license tax of two hundred and fifty ($250) dollars in each and every county in which said business is conducted or carried on, and if more than one place of such business shall be operated by any person, firm or corporation, a separate state and county license shall be taken out for each such place; and no person, firm or corporation shall offer with merchandise, bargained or sold as aforesaid, any coupon, profit-sharing certificate or other evidence of indebtedness or liability, redeemable by any other person, firm or corporation than the one offering the same without paying the above license for each other person, firm or corporation who may redeem the same. The license prescribed in this section shall be in addition to other licenses prescribed by this act. Any \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 345]\n\u00a0\n person violating any of the provisions of this section, whether acting for himself or as the agent of another, shall on conviction thereof be punished by fine not exceeding one thousand ($1,000) dollars or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six months.\n\n'Mercantile agencies: Shall pay a license tax of one hundred ($100) dollars in each county in which an office is established.\n\n'Merchants using trading stamps, shall pay a license tax of two hundred and fifty ($250) dollars for each place of business where they use such stamps.\n\n'Merchant tailors shall pay a license tax of ten ($10) dollars for each place of business.'\n\n This suit was instituted by appellees (Florida merchants) against appellant Rast as tax collector of Duval county, Florida, and the tax collectors of each county in the state, the different state's attorneys, county solicitors, and prosecuting attorneys of the circuits and counties of Florida. The purpose of the suit was to restrain those officers from proceeding under the statute or enforcing it. A preliminary and perpetual injunction was prayed, and that the act be declared unconstitutional, illegal, and void.\n The bill is very elaborate and we select from its repetitions and condense the following: It alleges the various businesses in which the complainants are engaged. The Van Deman & Lewis Company is a Florida corporation and a wholesale grocer, doing business as such and selling groceries in certain counties in the state; Harkisheimer Company is also a Florida corporation and is a retail grocer; J. S. Pinkussohn Cigar Company is a corporation organized under the laws of South Carolina and is a wholesale and retail merchant, buying and selling cigars and other tobacco products in the cities of Jacksonville and Pensacola, Florida. With these complainants were joined others, corporations and individuals, doing business in Florida. \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 346]\n\u00a0\n It is alleged that complainants and each of them, in the conduct of their business, offer for sale and deal in various and numerous articles of merchandise manufactured and produced in other states than Florida by persons and corporations in those states and shipped into Florida to be sold therein, and who, for the purpose of advertising their businesses and increasing their sales, inclose in the packages in which the merchandise is put up for market and sale coupons, slips, certificates, and other profit-sharing discount or premium tokens. The articles and the persons and companies producing them are enumerated.\n The manner or method of disposing of and redeeming and taking up such coupons, etc., is alleged to be that the same are inclosed in packages or the wrappers thereof, or are a part of the wrappers, the packages are put into boxes, cases, or other receptacles or inclosures and shipped by the manufacturer or producer from his place of business outside of Florida to the merchants in Florida, generally to a wholesale merchant or jobber, and are received by such in Florida and sold to the retail merchants in that state. The retail merchant sells them to his customers. When the latter have accumulated a sufficient number of the coupons, etc., to entitle them to receive a premium or article or payment therefor according to some list, catalogue, or rule promulgated by the manufacturer, producer, or original shipper, they send such coupons, etc., to such manufacturer, producer, or original shipper, or, in some instances, to a company or agency in some state other than Florida, where they are redeemed or paid, or the articles which the purchasers have selected are sent to them in consideration of such coupons, etc., or for the same and a postage stamp or stamps, or a small sum of money in addition thereto. And this in accordance with the contract, agreement, or sale made to the purchasers by the manufacturer, shipper, or producer outside of the \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 347]\n\u00a0\n state. And it is alleged that the transactions so detailed, the manufacture without the state and shipment to wholesale merchants within the state, the sale by the latter to retail merchants, and by the latter again to customers, constitute interstate commerce.\n That the form of the coupons, etc., varies, and when its identity is secured as prescribed it is evidence that each purchaser of a package has bought a definite part of some article, to be selected by him or her from a certain list, the list showing a number of valuable articles which can be paid for by a certain number of the tokens and a two-cent stamp.\n In another case there is an accumulation of the tokens which are to be sent to the redemption or coupon agency or corporation and exchanged for a valuable article of merchandise to be selected by the purchaser from a list or catalogue furnished him.\n Another form of coupons, etc., is where each of them is good for a certain value; for instance, one-half cent in presents or premiums, the coupons being sent from the state of Florida to another state. There are also other forms in which the coupons or tokens are to be redeemed, paid for, or used in the purchase of other articles of merchandise or in the accumulation of premiums or the like. All of the articles are known and largely used as legitimate articles of commerce, and the transactions detailed are interstate commerce.\n That divers forms of coupons, etc., in connection with the sale of merchandise, are used by the merchants of the state substantially in similar form mentioned above, and the payment or redemption is made by the Florida merchant in Florida, sometimes by the delivery of some valuable article of merchandise; sometimes by the payment of cash or the allowance of credit on account of purchases in the nature of a discount, or for or on account of a certain amount having been purchased of the merchant by the \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 348]\n\u00a0\n customer. The tokens are sometimes in the form of a cash register slip or memorandum.\n That the methods detailed are a form of advertising and the use of such coupons, etc., induces purchasers to trade more largely with and to make more of their purchases from complainants on account of the additional inducement of such coupons, etc.; that they increase the businesses of complainants and their profits, and enable them to carry and sell stocks of goods covering the various articles of merchandise, and are of great importance and value to complainants in their several businesses; and if they are prevented from using them, their businesses will be decreased to the amount of many thousands of dollars.\n That at the time of the passage of the statute complainants had on hand large amounts and quantities of goods, and if they are prevented from selling them in the manner detailed they will be subjected to great loss and damage, will be embarrassed and injured in their businesses, and the value of their property destroyed or greatly lessened.\n That the transactions and methods give an additional value to purchasers and they are substantially benefited thereby. That there is no element of gambling or chance in the transactions, and nothing in them or their methods prejudicial to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare.\n That if there is a cessation of the transactions, purchasers and customers who have received tokens, but have not accumulated a sufficient number of them, will be unable to have the same redeemed or paid, or secure articles therewith. That about 500 merchants are similarly affected with complainants.\n That certificates or tokens commonly called trading stamps, and so designated in the statute, are substantially like some of the tokens hereinbefore mentioned and \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 349]\n\u00a0\n described, and when delivered by retail merchants with the various articles sold to purchasers, such purchasers are entitled to purchase or receive various valuable articles of merchandise, according to a list or catalogue, upon the presentation of the stamps to some person or company that has issued the trading stamps, and that redeems them according to the provisions of such list or catalogue.\n That under the statute every person, firm, or corporation offering with merchandise any coupon, profit-sharing certificate, or other evidence of indebtedness or liability redeemable in premiums, is not only liable to pay the license tax for himself or itself, but to pay such tax for every other person, firm, or corporation who may redeem any such coupon, etc.\n That such taxes are unreasonable, enormous, and prohibitive on account of the number of articles sold, and by reason of the provision requiring complainants and each and every other person in like situation to pay the license tax to the state, and it is alleged with much circumstance that, from their number and the number of the articles that each sells, each and every person would be required to pay for license tax to the state and for one county or one place of business alone $15,000 per year, or one half that amount for six months or less time.\n That as a result of the statute, if the tax be paid for only 100 persons, or persons, firms, or corporations, it would amount to $75,000 per annum; if for 1,000 persons, or persons, firms, or corporations in Florida for one place of business, it would amount to $750,000, and so on as to any number to be paid by and for each and every manufacturer, producer, or shipper.\n That such coupons, etc., inclosed in packages of tobacco and so delivered, are authorized and rendered lawful by  3394 of the Revised Statutes of the United \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 350]\n\u00a0\n States, as amended by  10 of the act of July 24, 1897 [30 Stat. at L. 206, chap. 11], and by  2 of the act of July 1, 1902 [32 Stat. at L. 715, chap. 1371, Comp. Stat. 1913,  6204], of the statutes of the United States.\n That the provision of  35 (the provision quoted above) of the Florida statute and all provisions and enactments for its enforcement are in violation of the Constitution of the United States in that they violate ( 1) the commerce clause, (2) the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, and (3) the equal protection clause of that Amendment. There are many specifications of the particulars and it is alleged: (1) The statute discriminates between merchants in similar lines of business. (2) Between merchants who advertise in a certain manner and those who advertise in another manner. (3) The taxes are not upon the business or occupation of complainants, but upon the mere incidents of the business, and are an unreasonable and illegal interference with the method and manner of conducting the business. (4) The taxes are unreasonable, arbitrary, oppressive, discriminatory, and prohibitory for the reasons already detailed, and are far in excess of the amounts of taxes or licenses fixed or imposed when other methods of advertising or inducing custom are used, and will prevent complainants from carrying on their legitimate business. ( 5) They are not productive of revenue, are in excess of the profits of the businesses, and are in fact prohibitory. (6) That the methods employed by complainants in no wise affect the public health, morals, or welfare, and the imposition of the taxes is in no way a legitimate or lawful exercise of the police power of the state. (7) That the fines are so onerous, drastic, excessive, and enormous as to deter complainants in going on and doing business as they have heretofore done, and testing the validity of the statute in a court of law.\n That by the statute and in  59 thereof a violation of its provisions is made a misdemeanor, and it is provided \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 351]\n\u00a0\n in  35 that, for failure to pay any of the license taxes, any person, whether acting for himself or as agent of another, may be imprisoned in the county jail, not exceeding six months.\n It is further alleged that the statute impairs the obligations of the contracts entered into between complainants and their customers, in violation of clause 1,  10, article I., of the Constitution of the United States.\n That the officers of the state threaten to enforce the statute, and that the state's attorneys, county solicitors, and prosecuting attorneys of the several circuits and counties of the state are respectively empowered and authorized to prosecute in the several courts of the state, and such officers are threatening to prosecute divers of the complainants, and it is alleged that a multitude of prosecutions will be instituted, with seizures, sales, and injury to property, if a temporary restraining order be not granted. There is a prayer for such order and for a perpetual injunction.\n A restraining order was issued. The defendants appeared specially and filed motions to dismiss the suit, and as grounds thereof denied the allegations and implications of the bill as to the various grounds of infringement of the Constitution of the United States charged against the statute, and set up that complainants had a complete and adequate remedy at law. That the bill sought a restraint of the enforcement of a criminal statute of the state, and to enjoin an alleged threatened seizure of property in the enforcement of the alleged illegal tax, and the enforcement of the collection of a tax imposed by a statute of the state of a general and public nature.\n A motion was made for an interlocutory injunction, hearing upon which was referred to three judges. Upon the hearing the injunction was ordered ( 214 Fed. 827), to review which this appeal has been prosecuted. \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 352]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas F. West, Attorney General of Florida, for appellants.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 342, 353]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles M. Cooper for appellees.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 342, 355]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n It was determined that the bill set forth grounds of equitable relief; that the condition of complainants' businesses and of the property engaged in them was such that the statute, if exerted against complainants and their property, would produce irreparable injury, citing Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 52 L. ed. 714, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441, 14 Ann. Cas. 764; Dobbins v. Los Angeles, \n195 U.S. 223\n, 49 L. ed. 169, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 18; Davis & F. Mfg. Co. v. Los Angeles, \n189 U.S. 207\n, 47 L. ed. 778, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498. We concur in this view.\n Passing on the constitutional questions involved, the \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 356]\n\u00a0\n court was of opinion that the statute violated the 14th Amendment, and considered it unnecessary to decide whether there was an interference with interstate commerce.\n It is not entirely clear upon what clause of the 14th Amendment the court rested its judgment. The equality clause was selected for special comment. After stating the limitation upon legislation and the power of classification, the court proceeds to say: 'Is there a just basis for the classification attempted in this section [ 35] of the act? Merchants, etc ., all pay a tax according to the value of the stock carried by each, but if they sell goods for which coupons, etc., are given by themselves or others, then they must pay this additional tax for each place of business in each and every county in which said business is conducted or carried on. And if goods are offered for sale with which coupons are given, redeemable by persons other than the seller, then this tax must be paid by him for each of said lines of goods.\n'We can see no just basis for such classification. It is an arbitrary selection of one merchant for the imposition of a 'greater burden' than that imposed on others in the same calling and condition.' [214 Fed. 833.]\n\n But the court went farther and declared that 'the use of coupons, etc ., was an entirely legitimate method of advertising,' and that such had been the ruling in state cases which were cited. And excluding the application of cases adduced by defendants to sustain the statute as an exercise of the police power of the state, the court said: 'As before pointed out, this coupon business is legitimate, in no way affecting the health or morals of the community.'\n Though it is not clear, as we have said, certainly not explicit in the opinion of the court, whether it decided the due process clause as well as the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment was violated by the statute, \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 357]\n\u00a0\n we may assume that the violation of both was decided. It may be that the court thought that even though the use of coupons was a legitimate method of advertising, and not affecting the health or morals of the community, it was nevertheless within the power of the state to license if the statute were free from discrimination, or it may be that the court considered that the two grounds interlocked and were dependent upon the same reasoning. However, the two grounds may be, indeed must be, taken into consideration, as they are submitted for decision.\n The ground of discrimination, simply and separated from the other attacks upon the statute, does not present much difficulty. The difference between a business where coupons are used, even regarding their use as a means of advertising, and a business where they are not used, is pronounced. Complainants are at pains to display it. The legislation which regards the difference is not arbitrary within the rulings of the cases. It is established that a distinction in legislation is not arbitrary, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, and the existence of that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co. \n220 \nU.S. 61, 78\n, 55 S. L. ed. 369, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160. It makes no difference that the facts may be disputed or their effect opposed by argument and opinion of serious strength. It is not within the competency of the courts to arbitrate in such contrariety. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 U.S. 549\n, 55 L. ed. 328, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 259; German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, \n233 \nU.S. 389, 413\n, 414 S., 58 L. ed. 1011, 1022, 1023, L.R.A.1915C, 1189, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612; Price v. Illinois, \n238 \nU.S. 446, 452\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1400, 1405, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 892.\n It is the duty and function of the legislature to discern and correct evils, and by evils we do not mean some definite injury, but obstacles to a greater public welfare. Eubank v. Richmond, \n226 \nU.S. 137, 142\n, 57 S. L. ed. 156, 158, 42 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1123, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 76, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 192; Sligh v. Kirkwood, \n237 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 59 S. L. ed. 835, 837, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 501. And, we repeat, 'it may make discriminations if founded on distinctions that we cannot pronounce unreasonable and purely arbitrary.' Quong \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 358]\n\u00a0\n Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59, 62\n, 56 S. L. ed. 350, 351, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192, and the cases cited above.\n Of course, an element to be considered is the authority of the legislature over the subject-matter, and this will best be examined in considering the contentions of complainants under the due process clause. Preceding that, however, are the contentions based on the commerce clause and the sanction which the Constitution gives to the integrity of contracts.\n First, as pertinent to our discussion are the specific schemes at which, it is said, the statute is directed, and we adopt complainants' description of them. The first is 'where the Florida merchant issues his own coupon, certificate, or cash register receipt, and himself makes payment or redemption of the same, sometimes by the delivery of some valuable article of merchandise, sometimes by the payment of cash or allowance of credit on account of purchases, being in the nature of a discount, or for or on account of a certain amount having been purchased of the merchant by the customer.' In a word, it is a case where the Florida merchant issues his own coupons and redeems them.\n The second is 'where the manufacturer or shipper outside of the state of Florida, in some other state of the Union, inserts such coupons or certificates in packages of his goods which he ships to Florida, and the ultimate purchaser or consumer takes such coupons or certificates from such packages and returns them to such manufacturer or shipper in such state outside of Florida, who gives a premium for them and sends such premium or proceeds of redemption to such ultimate purchaser or consumer in Florida who has forwarded to him such coupons or certificates.' The merchandise so shipped into Florida is kept in stock by the merchants of the state, and the coupons, etc., are delivered upon the sale of the merchandise to their customers, who have them redeemed in the \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 359]\n\u00a0\n manner described. That is, the coupons are redeemed by the person who originally issues them; the coupons, however, to repeat, being delivered by the Florida merchant as a part of the transaction between him and the purchaser from him at retail.\n The third is 'where the manufacturer or shipper in a state other than Florida inserts in the packages of his goods which he ships to Florida such coupons or certificates which are taken from the packages by the ultimate purchaser or consumer in Florida and sent to some company or agency in some state of the United States outside of the state of Florida other than the manufacturer or shipper of the goods, to be redeemed or paid, and the premium or proceeds thereof is returned by such company or agency to the person in Florida who has sent such coupons or certificates.' This differs from the other two cases in that a premium company or agency other than the manufacturer or shipper himself is used for the redemption or payment of the coupons or certificates. But here again the Florida merchant is a factor because it is in completion of the sale by him at retail that the coupons are delivered to the purchasers.\n We are careful, by much repetition, to show the difference between the cases, to distinguish between the premium systems, and to show, as urged by counsel, that this case is not concerned with a license tax upon a trading stamp business pure and simple, a license upon companies engaged in such business being provided by another section of the statute. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n It is well here to observe, to avoid misunderstanding, that the redemption in the first scheme is 'sometimes by the payment of cash or allowance of credit on account of \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 360]\n\u00a0\n purchases or for or on account of a certain amount having been purchased of the merchant by the customer.' We are not concerned with a statute directed solely at such method of redemption or a business so confined. The Florida statute imposes its license tax on coupons, etc., 'redeemable in premiums.' And therefore, whether any other method of redemption-be it by giving a discount or an allowance of credit simply-would be amenable to objection, we express no opinion. In all of the schemes other methods of redemption are used and are attempted to be justified.\n With this comment we may say that all of the schemes have a common character,-something is given besides that which is or is supposed to be the immediate incentive to the transaction of sale and purchase,-something of value given other than it; and even as to the second and third schemes, the transactions are only executed through the purchase at retail. In other words, they are not designed for or executed through a sale of the original package of importation, but in the packages of retail and sale to the individual purchaser and consumer. This fixes their character as transactions within the state, and not as transactions in interstate commerce, and this is conceded as to the first scheme; it is true as to the second and third schemes. All of the schemes have their influence and effect within the state. Nor is such influence and effect changed or lessened by the redemption of the tokens outside of the state.\n The transactions, therefore, are not in interstate commerce. The sales, as we have said, are not in the packages of that commerce; they are essentially local sales, schemes consummated by such sales, and it is upon them and on account of their effect that the statute has imposed its license tax, and not upon the shipment into the state nor their disposition in the packages of importation. Of course, there is shipment to Florida merchants, but \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 361]\n\u00a0\n for the disposition of the merchandise in retail trade. The schemes contemplate such disposition and are executed by it. Detach the importations from the retail sale, consider only the transportation to the state of merchandise in its original package, being sold therein in such package, and there may, indeed, be interstate commerce; but so detached and so considered the importations are left without purpose, the schemes without execution. Indeed, complainants contend for the right not only of importations in the original package containing the coupons, but the disposition of the goods and coupons through the retail merchant. This, we repeat, has no protection in the commerce clause.\n Nor is the regulation of the statute prohibited by  3394 of the Revised Statutes of the United States as amended in 1897 [30 Stat. at L. 206, chap. 11] and 1902 [32 Stat. at L. 715, chap. 1371, Comp. Stat. 1913 ,  6204]. Section 3394 provides for a tax on cigars and cigarettes. By the amendment of 1897 it was forbidden to pack in, attach to, or connect with any package of tobacco or cigarettes anything but the wrappers, and it was further provided that there should not be affixed to, or branded, stamped, marked, written, or printed upon the packages or their contents any promise or offer of, or any order or certifiate for, any gift, prize, premium, payment, or reward. This provision upset the practice of manufacturers, and was attacked on the ground that it was beyond the power of Congress under the Constitution to enact, the prohibited practice being a method of advertising. The provision was sustained. Felsenheld v. United States, \n186 U.S. 126\n, 46 L. ed. 1085, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 740, affirming 103 Fed. 453. In 1902 the paragraph containing the provision was amended so as to forbid the inclosure or attachment to the packages of 'any paper, certificate, or instrument purporting to be or represent a ticket, chance, share or interest in, or dependent upon the event of a lottery, \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 362]\n\u00a0\n nor any indecent or immoral picture, representation, print or words.'\n Let it be granted that this provision permitted the inclosure in the package of tobacco of tokens of the character with which this case is concerned. It goes not farther nor does it purport to go farther. It does not attempt to protect and enforce the permission to the retail sales of packages in the state. It might not legally have such effect if attempted; and such attempt will not lightly be inferred. Savage v. Jones, \n225 U.S. 501\n, 56 L. ed. 1182, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 715; Standard Stock Food Co. v. Wright, \n225 U.S. 540\n, 56 L. ed. 1197, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 784. The statute of Florida does not seek to control the interstate transportation of the packages; it controls only their sale in the state through the retail merchant, or, it may be, directly to the individual consumer for the purpose described, and in both cases for the ultimate redemption of the tokens delivered with the sale.\n McDermott v. Wisconsin, \n228 U.S. 115\n, 57 L. ed. 754, 47 L.R.A.(N.S.) 984, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 39, is not applicable. There Congress, for the effective execution of the food and drugs act, defined what the 'package' of commerce should be, and necessarily any law which conflicted with it was void. In the case at bar there is no such definition. There is only permission to insert in the package whatever the manufacturer of tobacco may choose, with a single exception. There is no compulsion of use, and omission to avail of the permission has no effect upon the purpose of Congress in the enactment of the revenue laws which provide for the packing of tobacco products.\n The contract clause of the Constitution is also unavailable to complainants. The statute must be held to have prospective operation. Sales completed before its enactment are unaffected by it. We say 'sales completed,' and by this we mean those in which the right of redemption according to some of the schemes has accrued as distinguished from what is alleged in the bill as 'the \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 363]\n\u00a0\n understanding and expectation' arising from one or more sales that complainants would continue to sell to such purchasers other articles so that they might be able to accumulate tokens and use them. It cannot be said that there is an obligation to continue sales or an obligation to continue purchases. Besides, as the business is subject to regulation, the contracts made in its conduct are subject to such regulation. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 U.S. 467\n, 55 L. ed. 297, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 671, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265, and New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v. Gray, \n239 U.S. 583\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 176.\n Having disposed of the other contentions of complainants, we are brought to a consideration of the question whether the statute of Florida offends the due process clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. In other words, does the statute interfere with the business liberty of complainants? Is it an illegal meddling with a lawful calling and a deprivation of freedom of contract? This is the contention, and it is attempted to be supported by the assertion that the schemes detailed in the bill are but a method of advertising, and, as such, mere allurements to customers, not detrimental in any way to the public health and morals, nor obstructive of the public welfare; but are a means of enterprise, mere incidents of the businesses of complainants, and as beneficial to their customers as to them. And besides, that they are but a method of giving discount, practically in some instances a rebate upon the price, and in others an equivalent gift of some article that may attract the choice of the purchaser, the choice being free and the article of definite utility and value.\n These contentions have the support of a number of cases. They are opposed by others, not nearly so numerous as the supporting cases, but marking a change of opinion. Both sets of cases indicate by the statutes passed upon a persistent legislative effort against the schemes under review or some form of them, beginning in 1880 and \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 364]\n\u00a0\n repeated from time to time until the statute in controversy was passed in 1913.2 In such differences between judicial and legislative opinion where should the choice be? That necessarily depends upon what reasoning judicial opinion was based. We appreciate the seriousness of the situation. Regarding the number of the cases only, they constitute a body of authority from which there might well be hesitation to dissent except upon clear compulsion.\n The foundation of all of them is that the schemes detailed are based on an inviolable right, that they are but the exercise of a personal liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States and distinguished from other lawful exercise of business contracts and activity by a method of advertising and lawful inducements to an increased custom, and that in them there is no element of chance or anything detrimental to the public welfare. But there may be partial or total dispute of the propositions. And it can be urged that the reasoning upon which they are based regards the mere mechanism of the schemes alone, and does not give enough force to their influence upon conduct and habit, not enough to their insidious potentialities. As to all of which not courts, but legislatures, may be the best judges, and, it may be, the conclusive judges.\n This may be illustrated. A lottery of itself is not wrong, may be fairer, having less of overreaching in it, than many of the commercial transactions that the Constitution protects. All participants in it have an equal chance; there is no admonishing caveat of one against the other. And at one time it was lawful. It came to be condemned by experience of its evil influence and effects. It is trite to say that practices harmless of themselves may, from \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 365]\n\u00a0\n circumstances, become the source of evil or may have evil tendency. Murphy v. California, \n225 U.S. 623\n, 56 L. ed. 1229, 41 L.R.A.(N.S.) 153, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 697.\n But no refinement of reason is necessary to demonstrate the broad power of the legislature over the transactions of men. There are many lawful restrictions upon liberty of contract and business. It would be an endless task to cite cases in demonstration, and that the supplementing of the sale of one article by a token given and to be redeemed in some other article has accompaniments and effects beyond mere advertising the allegations of the bill and the argument of counsel establish. Advertising is merely identification and description, apprising of quality and place. It has no other object than to draw attention to the article to be sold, and the acquisition of the article to be sold constitutes the only inducement to its purchase. The matter is simple, single in purpose and motive; its consequences are well defined, there being nothing ulterior; it is the practice of old and familiar transactions and has sufficed for their success.\n The schemes of complainants have no such directness and effect. They rely upon something else than the article sold. They tempt by a promise of a value greater than that article and apparently not represented in its price, and it hence may be thought that thus by an appeal to cupidity lure to improvidence. This may not be called in an exact sense a 'lottery,' may not be called 'gaming;' it may, however, be considered as having the seduction and evil of such, and whether it has may be a matter of inquiry,- a matter of inquiry and of judgment that it is finally within the power of the legislature to make. Certainly in the first instance, and, as we have seen, its judgment is not impeached by urging against it a difference of opinion. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 U.S. 549\n, 55 L. ed. 328, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 259, and German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, \n233 U.S. 389\n, 58 L. ed. 1011, L.R.A. 1915C, 1189, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612. And it is not required that we should be sure as to the precise reasons for such judgment, or that we should certainly know them \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 366]\n\u00a0\n or be convinced of the wisdom of the legislation. Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 126\n, 127 S., 54 L. ed. 688, 694, 695, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 496. See also Munn v. Illinois, \n94 \nU.S. 113, 132\n, 24 S. L. ed. 77, 86.\n But it may be said that judicial opinion cannot be controlled by legislative opinion of what are fundamental rights. This is freely conceded; it is the very essence of constitutional law, but its recognition does not determine supremacy in any given instance. 'While the courts must exercise a judgment of their own, it by no means is true that every law is void which may seem to the judges who pass upon it excessive, unsuited to its ostensible end, or based upon conceptions of morality with which they disagree. Considerable latitude must be allowed for differences of view as well as for possible peculiar conditions which this court can know but imperfectly, if at all. Otherwise a constitution, instead of embodying only relatively fundamental rules of right, as generally understood by all English-speaking communities, would become the partisan of a particular set of ethical or economical opinions, which by no means are held semper ubique et ab omnibus.' Otis v. Parker, \n187 \nU.S. 606, 608\n, 609 S., 47 L. ed. 323, 327, 328, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 168.\n That case illustrated the reach of the power of government to protect or promote the general welfare. It sustained a provision of the Constitution of the state of California which made void all contracts for the sale of the stock of corporations on margin or to be delivered at a future day. The practice had been common, its evil was disputed. It was attempted to be justified by argument very much like those advanced in the case at bar, but this court decided that the legislative judgment was controlling.\n Even more pertinent in illustration of the power of the states as unaffected by the 14th Amendment is Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, \n226 U.S. 157\n, 57 L. ed. 164, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66. A statute of the state was sustained which provided that anyone engaged in the manufacture, production, or distribution \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 367]\n\u00a0\n of any commodity in general use, who should intentionally, for the purpose of destroying the competition of any regular, established dealer, discriminate between different places by selling such commodity at a lower rate in one place than such person charged in another, after equalizing the distance from the point of production, should be guilty of a crime. Freedom of conduct was restricted by the statute, which had its incentive in trade advantages. It was the judgment of the legislature that such practice was an impediment to the public welfare. The legislative judgment was sustained against the attack, among others, that the law was an infringement of freedom of conduct and contract.\n In Keokee Consol. Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 U.S. 224\n, 58 L. ed. 1288, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 856, the company issued scrip payable in merchandise only from its store as an advance of monthly wages in payment of labor performed. A statute of the state (West Virginia) prohibited the issue of any order for the payment of labor unless it was redeemable in money. The statute was assailed on the ground that it interfered with the freedom of contract. It will be observed that there was a consideration for the order payable in merchandise; it was a payment in advance, and hence it was asserted that the statute was an injury to the employees and employers. There were elements in the transactions of apparent advantage to both, and it would seem to have been within the liberty of both to contract upon an estimate of the value of that advantage. It was deemed an evil by the legislature and this court sustained its judgment.\n In Erie R. Co. v. Williams, \n233 U.S. 685\n, 58 L. ed. 1155, 51 L.R.A.( N.S.) 1097, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 761, a law of the state of New York required railroad companies to pay their employees semimonthly, and prohibited them from making contracts which should vary the time of payment. The law was sustained mainly upon the ground that it was an amendment of the charter of the corporation, but the extent of the police power was adverted to and the competency \n\n[240 U.S. 342, 368]\n\u00a0\n of the legislature exercising that power to enact the legislation. The incentive of the legislation was the benefit which accrued to the employees by the period of payment. The public welfare was deemed to be promoted by it.\n Other cases might be cited, and, it may be, of more pertinent application, which, from their number and instances, would seem to have uttered the last necessary word upon the power of the legislature to regulate conduct and contracts, and, in the exercise of the power, to classify objects, upon its conception of the public welfare, the right of review to be exerted by the courts only when the legislation is unreasonable or purely arbitrary.\n Complainants allege that the license tax which the statute imposes is of prohibitory character, and assert that they are exercising inviolable rights and privileges which the excess of the tax prevents in violation of the 14th Amendment; they contend that hence the statute is invalid.\n It is not certain from the allegations of the bill that the tax is of the asserted character, but granting it to be so, we have shown that the business schemes described in the bill are not protected from regulation or prohibition by the Constitution of the United States.

FARGO(1916)\nNo. 279\nArgued: March 13, 1916Decided: June 12, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 544, 545]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Oscar R. Houston and Howard S. Harrington for petitioner.\n Mr. Walter F. Taylor for James C. Fargo.\n Messrs. Roscoe H. Hupper and Norman B. Beecher for the International Mercantile Marine Company.\n Messrs. Livingston Platt and Frank H. Platt for T. Hogan & Sons.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n This controversy thus arose: In December, 1910, Reid, the petitioner, delivered in London to the American Express Company an automobile, to be carried to New York. The Express Company, in a communication concerning the shipment, was informed that the car was worth about $3,900. The car was boxed by the Express Company and by it delivered to the Minnewaska, a steamship belonging to the International Mercantile Marine Company, bound for New York. The Express Company shipped the car in its own name as consignor, to itself in New York as consignee, and no express notice was given to the ship of the real value of the package and its contents. The bill of lading issued by the steamship company expressly limited the liability to $100, and contained the following clause: 'It is also mutually agreed that the value of each package shipped hereunder does not exceed $100, or its equivalent in English currency on which basis the freight is adjusted, and the carrier's liability shall in no case exceed that sum, unless a value \n\n[241 U.S. 544, 546]\n\u00a0\n in excess thereof be specially declared, and stated herein, and extra freight as may be agreed on paid.' On the arrival of the ship at New York, T. Hogan & Sons, Incorporated, stevedores, were employed to discharge the cargo. A sling was placed around the box containing the car, and a fall, with a hook attached to it, was affixed to the sling, and by a winch the car was lifted up from the hold, through the hatchway. When it had passed above the hatchway, a hook attached to another tackle was fastened to the sling, this second tackle being used to swing the package toward and over the side of the ship, to land it on the pier. This was not accomplished, however, because, as the package swung over the side of the ship, toward the pier, the sling broke, and the car fell into the water, and was seriously damaged.\n In November, 1911, Reid filed his libel in the district court of the United States for the southern district of New York, against the Express Company, to recover from it the amount of damage caused to the automobile. Before answering, the Express Company, in conformity to admiralty rule 59, of this court, and with rule 15 in admiralty for the southern district of New York, filed two petitions, one against the steamship company, and the other against Hogan & Sons, to make them parties defendant on the ground that, if there was any liability on the part of the Express Company \n\n[241 U.S. 544, 547]\n\u00a0\n on the libel of Reid, both the steamship company and Hogan & Sons were responsible therefor, and asking a decree over against each of them separately in case there was any decree against the Express Company. Thereupon the Express Company answered the original libel, denying responsibility on the ground, among others, that it was a mere forwarder. Subsequently both Hogan & Sons and the steamship company answered not only the petitions of the Express Company, making them parties defendant, but also the original libel, traversing the alleged liability on various grounds. The latter company, however, referring to the limitation of liability to $100 in the bill of lading which it had issued, admitted its responsibility to that extent, and alleged that the sum thereof had been offered and declined.\n In March, 1913, an interlocutory decree was entered, holding that Hogan & Sons were primarily responsible, and that the Express Company was secondarily so, and that when the amount of the loss was ascertained, Reid would therefore have the right to recover the amount from Hogan & Sons, and in addition to recover from the Express Company any part of the sum which he was unable to collect under execution from Hogan & Sons. The final decree, which thereafter fixed the amount at $2,724.40, carried out the interlocutory decree. Nobody appealed from the interlocutory decree, and the Express Company did not appeal from the final decree, fixing its secondary liability. Hogan & Sons, however, did appeal. The court below, considering that, on the appeal, the case was before it for a trial de novo, and therefore that the rigths and liabilities of all the parties must be considered from that point of view, reversed the decree below, and held that error had been committed in the decree rendered against Hogan & Sons, because the proof did not establish that they had been negligent. As to the Express Company, it was also held that error had been \n\n[241 U.S. 544, 548]\n\u00a0\n committed in decreeing it to be liable secondarily, because, in receiving the automobile, it had acted in the capacity of a mere forwarder, and had discharged its obligations in that respect. As to the decree which dismissed the steamship company, it was held that error had been committed, because that company, as an insurer, was liable, not, however, exceeding the amount of $100, the limitation stated in the bill of lading. As the result of the allowance of a petition for certiorari, the correctness of these conclusions is now before us for decision.\n At the threshold it is insisted that the court below had no authority to consider the case as before it for a new trial, that is, de novo, and to award relief upon that theory, and that consequently it erred in reviewing the interlocutory decree, which was not appealed from, by which the steamship company was dismissed, and allowing a recovery against that company, and also in reviewing both the interlocutory and final decrees so far as it was essential to grant relief to the Express Company, because that company had not appealed. It is not denied that in the second circuit the right to a de novo trial was considered as settled by Munson S. S. Line v. Miramar S. S. Co. 93 C. C. A. 360, 167 Fed. 960, and that a well- established practice to that effect obtained, but it is insisted that a general review of the adjudged cases on the subject will show the want of foundation for the rule and practice. But we think this contention is plainly without merit, and that the right to a de novo trial in the court below authoritatively resulted from the ruling in Irvine v. The Hesper, \n122 U.S. 256\n, 30 L. ed. 1175, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1177,-a conclusion which is plainly demonstrated by the opinion in that case and the authorities there cited, and the long-continued practice which has obtained since that case was decided, and the full and convincing review of the authorities on the subject, contained in the opinion in the Miramar Case. Entertaining this view, we do not stop to consider the various arguments \n\n[241 U.S. 544, 549]\n\u00a0\n which are here pressed upon our attention, tending at least indirectly to establish the nonexistence of the right to the trial de novo in the court below, or that this case, for reasons which are wholly unsubstantial, may be distinguished and made an exception to the general rule, because to do so would serve no useful purpose, and would be at least impliedly to admit that there was room to discuss a question concerning which there was no room for discussion whatever.\n It is conceded that if the grounds relied upon to fix liability as against the Express Company, the steamship company, and Hogan & Sons are established, there is a right to an independent recovery as to each, whatever may be the recourse of these parties to recover over as against each other. Which of the defendants, if any, was liable primarily for the loss, is, then, to be considered. We first approach this question from the point of view of Hogan & Sons, because undoubtedly that company was in possession and control of the car at the time it dropped into the river and was damaged. While there is some confusion and various slight contradictions in the testimony, we are of the opinion that the trail court was right in holding that the loss occurred through the fault of Hogan & Sons, and therefore that the court below erred in reversing the decree against that company. And without undertaking to review the testimony, to all of which we have given a careful consideration, we content ourselves with briefly pointing out the general points of view which have led us to the conclusion stated. Without saying that the mere fact of the dropping of the automobile into the water in the course of delivery from the ship's hold to the pier serves to speak for itself on the issue of responsibility, that is, to bring the case within the principle of res ipsa loquitur, we are of the opinion that, by analogy, the case well illustrates that rule for this reason: Some cause must be found for the dropping of the car into the river, and only \n\n[241 U.S. 544, 550]\n\u00a0\n two theories on this subject may be deduced from the proof: either that the accident to the car occurred without fault, as the result of the breaking of the rope composing the sling because of some unseen and hidden defect in such rope, or that it was occasioned by some act of negligence or want of care in handling the car. The first, we are of opinion, is without any substantial support in the proof; in fact, to accept it would conflict with direct and positive proof to the contray. That view, therefore, could only be sustained by substituting imagination for proof. The second, on the contrary, we are of opinion, finds cogent support from the proof which could only be escaped by overthrowing it by the process of imagination to which we have just referred. It is unquestioned that when the sling was put around the box containing the car, preparatory to attaching the hook in order to hoist it, no blocks or other means were used to prevent the rope from being worn or cut by the edges of the box. The presumption that the rope was strong and efficient, arising from the fact that it held the weight of the box until it was lifted above the hatch, and until, by the swinging motion, the danger of straining or cutting of the ropes upon the edges was more likely to result, gives adequate ground for the inference that such cutting and straining occurred and led to the severance of the rope, and the precipitation of the car into the water. And this inference is supported by various other circumstances which we do not stop to recapitulate.\n Were the steamship company and the Express Company, in the order stated, liable to Reid, the libellant, dependent upon his inability to make under execution the amount of the decree from Hogan & Sons, is, then, the only remaining question. In substance this question, however, is negligible since, in the argument at bar, it was conceded that T. Hogan & Sons, Incorporated, were amply solvent, and that there was no question of their ability \n\n[241 U.S. 544, 551]\n\u00a0\n to respond to any decree which might be rendered against them. To avoid, however, all miscarriage of right from any possible, though improbable, change of conditions, without going into detail or stating the considerations which control our conclusion on the subject, we content ourselves with saying, first, that as to the steamship company we are of the opinion that, on the failure to make the amount of the decree against Hogan & Sons, the libellant will be entitled to recover over against that company to the amount of $100, to which its liability was limited, as stated in the bill of lading under which the shipment was made; second, that even looking upon the Express Company as a forwarder, under the circumstances of the case and the terms of the bill of lading under which the car was shipped by that company, the trial court rightly held it liable, and that recovery against it on failure to enforce the decree against Hogan & Sons will also obtain.\n It follows that the decree below must be reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court, with directions to set aside its decree in so far as it dismissed the steamship company from the case, and to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRICHARDSON v.

Purporting to proceed under act No. 35, Laws of Porto Rico, 1911 (copied in margin), and claiming the assess- \n\n[241 U.S. 44, 47]\n\u00a0\n ment was wholly illegal, the Sugar Company brought this suit to recover the sum so paid. In due season the treasurer of Porto Rico, appearing by its attorney general, made full answer to the original complaint; a day for trial was fixed by stipulation; an amended and also a supplemental complaint were filed and appropriately answered. Eight months after institution of the action the court's jurisdiction was first challenged by motion to dismiss, and thereafter the point was persistently urged. The company recovered judgment for amount claimed (6 Porto Rico Fed. Rep. 224); and the cause has been argued here by counsel.\n It is not now seriously maintained that the tax was lawfully demanded- in effect, the contrary is conceded.\n A reversal of the district court's action is asked upon the theory that the proceeding is against Porto Rico, a government of sovereign attributes, which has only consented to be sued in its own courts.

Smith, Attorney General of Minnesota, and Messrs. William J. Stevenson and John M. Rees for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit in equity to cancel certain assessments for the year 1912, and to restrain the collection of taxes imposed accordingly upon the plaintiffs and others in like case with respect to their memberships in the Chamber of Commerce of the city of Minneapolis. There were three groups alleged to be represented by the respective plaintiffs: One, of members residing in Minneapolis; another, of those residing within the state, but outside that city; and a third, of citizens and residents of other states. The complaint, among other things, averred in substance that the Chamber of Commerce was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota; that it had no capital stock and transacted no business for profit; that it furnished buildings and equipment for its members, who, under its rules, transacted business with each other (for themselves and their customers) upon the trading floor which was in fact a grain exchange; that the property of the corporation had been fully taxed; that the memberships, in case of winding up, would have actually no value \n\n[240 U.S. 184, 186]\n\u00a0\n above the assets so taxed; that it had been the practical construction of the tax laws of the state that such memberships were not taxable; that the assessments in question had been laid under the head of 'Moneys and Credits,' and that they were excessive; that memberships in other associations were not taxed 'although standing in a similar position;' that the members of the Chamber of Commerce were 'unlawfully and prejudicially' discriminated against 'by unequally assessing them,' and that their property was taken 'without due process of law, contrary to the state and Federal Constitutions;' that, unless restrained, the attempt to enforce the tax would result in a multiplicity of suits; that in the case of members residing outside of the city of Minneapolis, the certificates of membership were 'kept at their respective residences' and such members did not 'operate' upon the exchange personally except 'at rare intervals,' and that their use of such memberships was practically limited to benefits obtained 'from having other members buy or sell grain for them as commission merchants' at one half the 'regular commission' by reason of 'a privilege extended to the members under the rules.'\n The defendants demurred to the complaint upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The trial court denied a motion for temporary injunction and sustained the demurrer, and thereupon judgment was entered in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs appealed to the supreme court of the state, assigning as error the holding of the trial court that the assessments 'did not deny to the several members in the respective classes the equal protection of the laws' and did not constitute a taking of property 'without due process of law and without compensation,' contrary to the Federal Constitution. The latter objection was stated in various forms, specific complaint being made of the assessment of those members who were said to be outside the \n\n[240 U.S. 184, 187]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction of the taxing officers. Another appeal was then pending in the same court in the case of State v. McPhail, 124 Minn. 398, 50 L.R.A.(N. S.) 255, 145 N. W. 108, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 538, relating to the taxation of memberships in the Board of Trade of Duluth, and, by stipulation, the appeals were heard together. In the Duluth Case, the supreme court held that the membership was taxable under the stautes of the state, and, further, sustained the tax there laid as against contentions under the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment. The court said: 'We do not sustain the claims that the taxation of memberships in a board of trade or stock exchange would violate provisions of the Federal or state Constitution. . . . We see no improper classification here, nor any lack of equality or uniformity. Nor would it be double taxation. The members of the board are not required to pay taxes on the physical and tangible property of the board, nor does the board pay taxes upon the intangible rights which constitute the value of a membership. And we hold that proceedings to tax such a membership do not deprive the member of his property without due process of law, take property for public use without just compensation, or deny such member the equal protection of the laws, in violation of familiar provisions of the Federal Constitution and Amendments.' State v. McPhail, supra.\n At the same time, the decision in the instant case was rendered with an opinion per curiam in which, after a summary statement of the nature of the case, the court ruled as follows: 'The case was submitted on briefs in this court with State v. McPhail. The decision in that case, filed herewith, controls this. Judgment affirmed.' 124 Minn. 539, 145 N. W. 112. And this writ of error has been sued out.\n The defendants in error insist that the decision of the state court involved no Federal question; that the suit was for injunction and that the plaintiffs had an adequate \n\n[240 U.S. 184, 188]\n\u00a0\n remedy at law. They invoke the familiar rule that when the decision of the state court rests upon an independent or non-Federal ground, adequate to support it, this court has no jurisdiction. Hammond v. Johnston, \n142 \nU.S. 73, 78\n, 35 S. L. ed. 941, 942, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141; Gaar, S. & Co. v. Shannon, \n223 \nU.S. 468, 470\n, 56 S. L. ed. 510, 512, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 236. But the state court, which alone determines local questions of procedure, did not deny relief because an injunction was sought or because it was considered that under the state law another remedy was appropriate. It said nothing whatever as to the form of remedy, or as to the right to proceed in equity, but considered and decided the case on the merits, including the Federal questions. No other conclusion can be drawn from the fact that the sole reason for the decision is found in the reference to State v. McPhail as authority,-a case in which no procedural question was involved. There, the action was brought by the state itself to recover the tax, and the decision was directly and exclusively upon the validity of the tax, it being sustained first, as one authorized by the state law, and, then, as not repugnant to the Federal Constitution. The fact that there were some objections to the constitutional validity of the tax in the present case that were not urged in the McPhail Case does not affect the matter. They were all grounds for the contention that the tax denied the equal protection of the laws and took property without due process of law. That was the ultimate contention which was overruled with respect to the tax in the McPhail Case, and the allusion to that decision as 'controlling' plainly meant that the court thought that all the reasons urged for a different view were without merit, and that the present tax did not violate the 14th Amendment. It is well settled that where the state court does not decide against the plaintiff in error upon an independent state ground, but, deemed the Federal question to be before it, actually entertains it and decides it adversely to the Federal right asserted, this court has \n\n[240 U.S. 184, 189]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction to review the judgment, assuming it to be a final judgment, as it is here.

Rep. 671.\n It is not to be doubted-giving full effect to all the allegations of the complaint-that the memberships, despite the restrictions of the rules, were property. See Hyde v. Woods, \n94 \nU.S. 523, 525\n, 24 S. L. ed. 264, 265; Sparhawk v. Yerkes, \n142 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 35 S. L. ed. 915, 917, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 104; Page v. Edmunds, \n187 \nU.S. 596, 604\n, 47 S. L. ed. 318, 322, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 200. As was said by the supreme court of the state with respect to memberships deemed to be essentially similar: 'A membership has a use value and a buying and selling or market value. It is bought and sold . . . . There is a lien upon it for balances due members. . . . It passes by will or descent and by insolvency or bankruptcy. . . . It is true that there are certain restrictions in the ownership and use of a membership. These may increase or decrease its value, probably in the case of a board of trade membership greatly enhance it. They do not prevent its being property.' 124 Minn. p. 401. Of course, there is nothing in the Federal Constitution which prevents the memberships here involved from being taxed, and the question whether they were in fact taxable under the statutes of the state was a matter of local law with which we are not concerned. It was the province of the state court to determine what the terms of the taxing statute authorized, and it is for this court to say whether, in view of the operation of the statute, as thus defined, it overrides the Federal right which is claimed. Clement Nat. Bank v. Vermont, \n231 \nU.S. 130, 134\n, 58 S. L. ed. 153, 155, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 31. It is insisted that there was no legislative \n\n[240 U.S. 184, 190]\n\u00a0\n authority for an official listing of this kind of property, or for an official estimate of its value, and hence that there is no valid taxing scheme. But it is manifest that the state court, in holding the memberships to be embraced within the description of property subject to taxation under the statutes, also held that the statutory scheme, including the provision for listing and for official valuation, did apply to these memberships. See 124 Minn. pp. 404-406. Complaint is made that in the present case the memberships were assessed under the head of 'Moneys and Credits.' But this is an administrative matter which does not touch the fundamentals contemplated by the 14th Amendment. If there was any error or irregularity in the particular application of the state statute in the case of the assessments in question, it was subject to correction according to the local practice; and the argument that the statute is defective because there is no legislative authority for listing and estimate we think is directly opposed to the construction placed upon the statute by the state court. It is also apparent that there is no merit in the objection that there was a violation of the Federal Constitution through what is called double taxation. The membership, as property, was distinct from the assets of the corporation. Van Allen v. Assessors ( Churchill v. Utica) 3 Wall. 573, 584, 18 L. ed. 229, 234; Farrington v. Tennessee, \n95 \nU.S. 679, 687\n, 24 S. L. ed. 558, 560; Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 \nU.S. 97, 106\n, 24 S. L. ed. 616, 620; Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee, \n161 \nU.S. 134, 146\n, 40 S.

The correct valuation of the membership, in view of all relevant facts, was a matter for the taxing officials, and we do not sit to review their judgment. The complaint makes no case whatever of a denial by the statutory scheme of proper opportunity for the hearing of grievances where the estimate is regarded by the members as excessive. See New York ex rel. Brooklyn City R. Co. v. New York State Tax Comrs. \n199 \nU.S. 48, 51\n, 52 S., 50 L. ed. 79, 84, 85, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 713; Orient Ins. Co. v.

On the contrary, the complaint alleges that the plaintiff duly appeared before the Board of Equalization of the city of Minneapolis and the Minnesota Tax Commission, acting as the State Board of Equalization, and on behalf of himself and other members asked to have the assessment canceled, or, if not canceled, to have it reduced to what was asserted to be a fairer valuation, and that the boards were each apparently inclined to grant the application; but, as it would seem, withheld action pending the decision of the courts as to the taxability of the memberships.\n There is the further contention with respect to the authority of the state to tax the memberships owned by citizens of other states. It is urged that the memberships are intangible rights held by the member at his domicil. But it sufficiently appears from the allegations that the memberships represented rights and privileges which were exercised in transactions at the exchange in the city of Minneapolis, and, we are of the opinion, applying a principle which has had recognition with respect to credits in favor of nonresidents arising from business within the state, and in the case of shares of stock of domestic corporations, that it was competent for the state to fix the situs of the memberships for the purpose of taxation, whether they were held by residents or nonresidents, at the place within the state where the exchange was located.

Rep. 201.\n With respect to discrimination, there is no tenable objection because of the exemption from taxation (if they were exempt) of the various organizations to which the plaintiffs in error refer,-such as the 'Associated Press, \n\n[240 U.S. 184, 192]\n\u00a0\n lodges, fraternal orders, churches, etc.' The description itself suggests manifest distinctions which the state is entitled to observe in its taxing policy, despite the general allegation that these associations stand 'in a similar position.' The state has a broad discretion as to tax exemptions ( Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvaniz, exemptions (Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 895, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533), and the averments of the complaint are very far from showing any basis for a charge of violation of the 14th Amendment by unwarrantable discrimination. And, finally, with respect to the argument that the plaintiffs in error were denied due process of law because the state court decided the case upon the authority of the McPhail Case, without referring to the asserted distinctions between the two cases, it is enough to say that the cause was heard and determined, and, viewing the judgment as passing upon all the Federal questions raised, we find no error.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds is of opinion that the writ of error should be dismissed. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROSENBERGER v. PACIFIC EXP CO.(1916)\nNo. 249\nArgued: March 8, 1916Decided: April 24, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 48, 49]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. J. Vineyard, A. F. Smith, and Frank F. Rozzelle for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. I. N. Watson and J. L. Minnis for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n On the taking effect in Texas on the 12th day of February, 1907, of a law imposing a state license tax of $5,000 annually on each place of business or agency of every express company where intoxicating liquors were delivered and the price collected on C. O. D. shipments, and by which law one half of the amount of the state license was in addition authorized to be imposed by every county or municipality, the Express Company, the defendant in error, discontinued at all its agencies in Texas all such business. As a result the company sent back to Kansas City, Missouri, the packages of intoxicating liquor which it had received under C. O. D. shipments made to various places in Texas from Kansas City by Rosenberger, the plaintiff in error, and tendered them to him, conditioned on his payment of the return carriage charges. Rosenberger refused to accept the offer, and brought this suit to recover the value of the merchandise, on the ground that the failure to carry out the shipments was a conversion. The trial court, holding the Texas act was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, and afforded no justification to the Express Company for refusing to carry out the shipments, awarded the relief sought. And the object of this writ of error is to obtain a reversal of a final judgment of the court below, reversing \n\n[241 U.S. 48, 50]\n\u00a0\n the trial court, and rejecting the claim on the ground that the Texas license law was not repugnant to the commerce clause, and afforded ample authority to the Express Company for refusing to complete the interstate shipments in question. 258 Mo. 97, 167 S. W. 429.\n Passing minor contentions whose want of merit will be hereafter demonstrated, it is clear that the issue is this: Was the state license law, if applied to C. O. D. interstate commerce shipments, repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution? It is certain that this question, in view of the date of the law and of the shipments involved, must be determined in the light of the operation of the commerce clause as affected by the power conferred upon the states by what is usually known as the Wilson law (act of August 8, 1890, chap. 728, 26 Stat. at L. 313, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8738), and wholly unaffected by  239 of the Penal Code enacted by Congress March 4, 1909 [35 Stat. at L. 1136, chap. 321, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,409] prohibiting the shipment of intoxicating liquors under C. O. D. contracts, and also without reference to the act of Congress known as the Webb-Kenyon law of March 1, 1913 (chap. 90, 37 Stat. at L. 699, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8739).\n Thus limited, as it is not controverted and indeed is indisputable that the provisions of the statute placed a direct burden on the shipments with which it dealt, and in fact were prohibitive of such shipments, it follows that error was committed in holding that the statute was not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States in so far as it applied to interstate C. O. D. shipments, for the following reasons: (a) Because it is settled from the beginning, and too elementary to require anything but statement, that, speaking generally, the states are without power to directly burden interstate commerce, and that commodities moving in such commerce only become subject to the control of the states or to the power on their part to directly burden after the termination of the interstate movement; that is, after the arrival and delivery of the commodities and their sale in the original packages; and that this rule is \n\n[241 U.S. 48, 51]\n\u00a0\n as applicable to the movement of intoxicating liquors as to any other commodities. (b) Because the Wilson act only modifies these controlling rules by causing interstate commerce shipments of intoxicating liquors to come under state control at an earlier date than they otherwise would; that is, after delivery, but before sale in the original packages. (c) Because the power in interstate commerce shipments to make C. O. D. agreements, that is, agreements on delivery of the commodity shipped to collect and remit the price, is incidental to the right to make such shipments, and the commodities when so shipped do not come under the authority of the state to which the commodities are shipped under such agreements until arrival and delivery, and therefore any attempt on the part of the state to directly burden or prohibit such contracts, or prevent the fulfilment of the same, necessarily comes within the general rule and is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.\n These propositions in substance have been by necessary implication or by direct decision so authoritatively and repeatedly determined, as shown by the cases cited in the margin,1 that there is no necessity for going further. But in view of the fact that the court below held the statute to be not repugnant to the commerce clause, not because it overlooked the rulings of this court referred to, but because it considered them distinguishable or inapposite to this case for reasons deemed by it to be conclusive, there being some difference of opinion on the subject in the court below, we briefly refer to those reasons. \n\n[241 U.S. 48, 52]\n\u00a0\n It was said that the shipment of commodities contains two elements: one, the obligation arising from the duty of the carrier to receive and carry without express contract; and the other, such obligation as arises from contracts made concerning the shipment, not embraced in the duty which rested by law upon the carrier in the absence of contract, the latter being illustrated by C. O. D. contracts. These two classes of obligations, it was pointed out, arising from different sources, were controlled by a consideration of the source whence they sprang; the one, the duty independent of contract, being commerce, and the other, the duty depending upon express contract, in a sense independent of commerce, being governed by the law controlling contracts; that is to say, the one being controlled by the commerce clause and the other by the law of the state. And from these generalizations it was concluded that however complete and efficacious was the control of the Constitution of the United States over the obligation resulting from shipments in the proper sense, it was clear that the power of the state was complete over the other class of obligations, those arising from distinct contracts, and hence the act imposing the burden on the contract to collect on delivery did not reach over into the domain of shipment, was independent of the same, and therefore was not repugnant to the commerce clause. But we think it is a sufficient answer to say that the reasoning referred to rests upon a misconception of the elementary notion of interstate commerce as inculcated and upheld from the beginning, and as enforced in a line of decisions of this court beginning with the very birth of the Constitution, and which in its fundamental aspect has undergone no change or suffered no deviation: that is, that the interstate commerce which is subject to the control of Congress embraces the widest freedom, including, as a matter of course, the right to make all contracts having a proper relation to the subject. Indeed, it must be at once apparent that if \n\n[241 U.S. 48, 53]\n\u00a0\n the reasoning we are considering were to be entertained, the plenary power of Congress to legislate as to interstate commerce would be at an end, and the limitations preventing state legislation directly burdening interstate commerce would no longer obtain, and the freedom of interstate commerce which has been enjoyed by all the states would disappear. But to state these general considerations is indeed superfluous, since in one of the previous cases which we have cited (American Exp. Co. v. Iowa, \n196 \nU.S. 133, 143\n, 144 S., 49 L. ed. 417, 422, 423, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182) substantially the identical contention which we have just disposed of was relied upon and its unsoundness was expressly pointed out and the destructive consequences which would arise from its adoption stated.\n The minor contentions to which we previously referred are these:\n\n 1. \nThat although it be that  239 of the Penal Code has no retroactive operation, it should be used as an instrument of interpretation from which to deduce the conclusion that the power of a state to prohibit shipments of intoxicating liquors in interstate commerce under C. O. D. contracts existed at the time here in question. But this by indirection simply seeks to cause the act of Congress to retroactively apply by reasoning which, if acceded to, would require it to be said that all the previous decisions of this court dealing with the subject before the Penal Code was enacted were wrong, and that, in addition, the enactment of  239 was wholly unnecessary.\n\n 2. \nThat even although there was a wrongful refusal of the Express Company to carry out the shipments, its doing so was a mere violation of contract, giving a right to sue in damages, but not for conversion. We see nothin in the record to indicate that this nothing in the record to indicate that this in the court below. But, passing this consideration, in view of our previous action rejecting a motion to dismiss, the question is foreclosed. But again, \n\n[241 U.S. 48, 54]\n\u00a0\n even if this be put out of view, the proposition is without merit under the controlling state law. Rice v. Indianapolis & St. L. R. Co. 3 Mo. App. 27; Loeffler v. Keokuk Northern Line Packet Co. 7 Mo. App. 185; Danciger Bros. v. American Exp. Co. 172 Mo. App. 391, 158 S. W. 466.\n\n 3. \nThat this case is taken out of the settled rule to which we have referred, and is controlled by the ruling in Delamater v. South Dakota, \n205 U.S. 93\n, 51 L. ed. 724, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 447, 10 Ann. Cas. 733. But the proposition presupposes that the decision in that case overruled the many decisions sustaining the rule without the slightest indication of a purpose to do so. It proceeds upon an obvious misconception of the Delamater case, which, instead of disregarding the construction put upon the Wilson act and the many cases dealing with the subject, was, on the contrary, but an application in a new form of the additional power which that act gave. In other words, the case but held that, inasmuch as Congress, by virtue of its regulating authority, had caused shipments of intoxicating liquors in interstate commerce to become subject to state authority after arrival and before sale in the original packages, the exertion by the state of its authority to prevent the carrying on in the state of the business of soliciting purchases of liquor to be shipped from other states was lawful as a mere exertion of police power, not constituting a direct burden upon interstate commerce, since such a regulation was within the scope of the remedial authority conferred by Congress by virtue of the Wilson act.\n And the contention just stated leads to a reference to suggestions which we deem to be wholly irrelevant to the issue for decision, made both in the opinion of the court below and in the argument at bar concerning possible abuses committed as the result of C. O. D. shipments of intoxicating liquors into states where the use of such liquor is prohibited, such as the unreasonable detention of such liquors before delivery, the ultimate delivery to a \n\n[241 U.S. 48, 55]\n\u00a0\n person who had not ordered the same, the transfer to others by the ostensible person to whom the shipment was seemingly made, etc., etc. We say irrelevant suggestions because we are considering here not whether a state statute enacting reasonable regulations to prevent abuses under C. O. D. shipments would be a direct burden upon interstate commerce, but are only called upon to determine whether a statute is repugnant to the commerce clause which expressly asserts the power of the state to forbid all C. O. D. interstate commerce shipments of intoxicating liquors without reference to abuse of any kind or nature in the manner in which said contracts are carried out.\n It follows from what we have said that the court below erred, and that its judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n And it is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Leisy v.

Judgment of nonsuit was entered on the first trial and was reversed by the circuit court of appeals. 109 C. C. A. 398, 187 Fed. 80. On the second trial, there was a verdict for the defendant, and the judgment entered accordingly was affirmed. 124 C. C. A. 434, 206 Fed. 646. The case comes here on certiorari. \n\n[241 U.S. 403, 407]\n\u00a0\n The facts are these: In December, 1903, the Centennial Mill Company, of Seattle, shipped by the steamship 'Hyades' of the 'Puget Sound-Oriental Line' 35,312 quarter sacks of flour to be transported to Port Arthur, or Dalny, and to be there delivered 'unto shipper's order or to his or their assigns (notify Clarkson & Company).' In accordance with the usual course of business the Centennial Mill Company drew its draft, dated December 11, 1903, on Clarkson & Company, for $36,194.80, payable ninety days after sight, to the order of the National Bank of Commerce (with exchange and collection charges), and, attaching thereto the original and duplicate of the bill of lading for the shipment above described (which was indorsed in blank), the policy of insurance, and bill of sale to Clarkson & Company, delivered the draft to the National Bank of Commerce, of Seattle, which paid the amount of the draft to the Mill Company. This bank then forwarded the draft, with the documents, to the Port Arthur branch of the Russo- Chinese Bank for collection, stating in the letter of transmittal: 'Documents are to be delivered on payment.' The letter, with the draft and documents, was received on January 22, 1904.1 In acknowledging receipt, the Russo-Chinese Bank used the usual form of letter, which stated that specific instructions must be given concerning disposition of bills and documents, and storage of goods, in case the draft were dishonored. No such instructions were given. The draft was presented for acceptance on January 23, 1904, and was accepted on January 30, 1904, by Clarkson & Company, and the Seattle bank was notified accordingly. The acceptance fixed April 30, 1904, as the due date, according to the tenor of the draft, and on the expiration of two days' grace allowed by the Russian law it was protested on May 3, 1904. There was evidence that the draft, with \n\n[241 U.S. 403, 408]\n\u00a0\n deed of protest, was mailed to the Seattle bank on May 26, 1904; and there was counter testimony that it never was received.\n The Russo-Japanese War was formally declared on February 10, 1904. From February 9th there was a stringent water blockade of Port Arthur, and about May 3d the investment was made complete by the Japanese land forces. Port Arthur fell on January 2, 1905, and thereupon the Japanese authorities took possession of all the books and documents of the Russo- Chinese Bank at Port Arthur; these were retained until March, 1906, when they were returned to the bank and taken to its home office at St. Petersburg.\n Clarkson & Company, an importing firm having its principal place of business at Vladivostok and a branch office at Port Arthur, were also the agents at the latter place of the steamship company which carried the flour. On April 29, 1904, the Port Arthur branch of the Russo-Chinese Bank wrote to the Shanghai branch of the bank (in answer to an inquiry requested by a representative of the Centennial Mill Company) that the bank had 'all shipping documents,' and added: 'The flour relative to the first three bills' (including the one in question) 'is in the hands of Clarkson & Company and has been sold by them. They promised to take up the bills as soon as they get the money of their sale . . . Bill No. 1559\/7035' (that is, the draft here involved) 'is due to-morrow and shall be protested if not paid.' It was further stated that the fact that Clarkson & Company had obtained possession of the goods, although the bill of lading was held by the bank, was due to their being the steamship agents, and could not be prevented. On July 7, 1904, the Seattle bank wrote to the Russo-Chinese Bank at St. Petersburg that Clarkson had advised the drawer that this draft, and others, had been paid before maturity. The Russo- Chinese Bank replied, in substance, that it was not in a \n\n[241 U.S. 403, 409]\n\u00a0\n position to trace the matter, but would investigate it as soon as possible. There was further correspondence in which the Seattle bank set forth its information as to the payment of the draft, and the Russo-Chinese Bank reiterated its inability to ascertain the facts. Finally, in response to the demand of the Seattle bank for the return of the bill of lading attached to the draft, or a remittance of its amount, the Russo-Chinese Bank, St. Petersburg, under date of November 9, 1904, forwarded to the Seattle bank a check for $36,013.70 (being $36,194.80, the face of the draft, less commission and charges), and added: 'It remains, of course, however understood that in case your above remittance proves not to have been paid for by Clarkson & Co. you are held responsible to refund the amount of our today's cheque.' The Seattle bank (December 5) acknowledged receipt, pointing out that a balance of $2,298.49 was still needed to make payment of principal and interest in full, and stating: 'We on our part agree upon return to us of both sets of bills, showing that the draft has not been paid, to reimburse you in the sum paid us, provided, that we were in no wise injured by the fact that your Port Arthur branch has indefinitely held the bills after their maturity, at which time they could have been returned to us and we could have collected from the Steamship Company.' On December 29, 1904, the Russo-Chinese Bank, St. Petersburg, enclosed check for the balance requested, and said: 'It remains understood that in case your above remittance proves not to have been paid, you declare yourselves ready to refund us these $2,298.49 with the $36,013.70, sent on 27\/9 November plus accrued interest.' And in reply the Seattle bank agreed 'that guarantee contained in our letter of December 5th shall also cover this amount.'\n When the Russo-Chinese Bank obtained from the Japanese authorities the books and documents, it ascertained that the draft in question had been protested for non- \n\n[241 U.S. 403, 410]\n\u00a0\n payment, and had been mailed to the Seattle bank. Thereupon, on June 27, 1906, the Russo-Chinese Bank demanded the refunding of the money paid to cover the draft. The demand was refused and this action was brought.\n It was alleged in the complaint that the payment to the Seattle bank had been made upon condition that 'if it should thereafter be ascertained that said draft had not been paid,' the money should be refunded, and that there had been no payment in fact. The defendant denied that the condition was as stated, and alleged that it had agreed to reimburse the plaintiff upon the return 'of both sets of bills' and a showing that the draft 'had not been paid,' provided the defendant was in no wise injured by the negligence of the plaintiff in the performance of its duties. It was further averred, among other things, that the draft had been paid in full by Clarkson & Company; that it was the duty of the plaintiff not to permit the flour represented by the bill of lading to be appropriated by Clarkson & Company; and that if the proceeds of the sale of the flour were not applied to the payment of the draft, the failure was due to the plaintiff's carelessness and breach of duty. The plaintiff in its reply denied these averments and alleged affirmatively that Clarkson & Company were the agents of the steamship company, and that it was well known to the defendant that, upon arrival, the flour would be delivered into their keeping as such agents, whether the draft was paid or not, and that the appropriation of the flour by them before payment was a matter not within plaintiff's control.\n The judgment of nonsuit on the first trial, because of a failure to show the return of the draft and accompanying documents, and thus to prove the breach of an express promise, was reversed upon the ground that the complaint stated a cause of action upon an implied agreement to restore money paid under mistake of fact. 109 C. C. A. 398, 187 Fed. p. 86. \n\n[241 U.S. 403, 411]\n\u00a0\n On the second trial the jury found a general verdict in favor of the defendant, and also returned a special finding as follows:\n'We . . . find that the Port Arthur branch of the Russo-Chinese Bank did receive payment for the draft dated December 11th, 1903, on account of which the plaintiff made the remittance to the defendant alleged in the complaint.'\n\n The court of appeals held that, notwithstanding the protest of the draft and the other evidence introduced by the plaintiff to show that it had not been paid, this special finding had sufficient support. In its succinct review of the evidence the court said:\n'The flour in question was carried to Port Arthur by the ship Hyades, which reached there about the middle of January, 1904. The evidence also shows that Clarkson & Company were large customers of the bank. The succeeding ship of the steamship company, also carrying flour among other things, reached Port Arthur about the 7th of February, 1904. Short' ( assistant manager of Clarkson & Company until, as he said, February 4, 1904) 'testified, among other things, that when the Hyades arrived with the 35,312 quarter sacks of flour in question, there were but from 6,000 to 8,000 sacks in Clarkson & Company's warehouse, and that when that shipment arrived he went to the Port Arthur bank on behalf of Clarkson & Company to accept the draft drawn for the purchase price of it, and did so; that when he accepted the draft Mr. Ofsiankin' (manager of the Russo- Chinese Bank at Port Arthur), 'on behalf of the bank, authorized Clarkson & Company to take immediate possession of the flour and sell it, and that he ( Short), on behalf of that firm, gave the bank what he designates as a 'letter of guaranty,' and what Davidson' (then, as he testified, manager of Clarkson & Company at Port Arthur) 'in his deposition designates as one of 'hypothecation,' recognizing the flour as the property of the bank until paid for, and \n\n[241 U.S. 403, 412]\n\u00a0\n agreeing to pay over to the bank the proceeds thereof until full payment was made; that the letter was 'the regular form of bank guaranty; it was a printed form,' said the witness. And both Short and Davidson testified that what was done in the matter of the shipment here in question was in accordance with a long-established custom between the Port Arthur bank and Clarkson & Company; Short testifying that: 'From the year 1900 the same rule existed. We always gave the bank a letter of guaranty against-a letter of guaranty to take delivery of the cargo, and the cargo belonged to them until it was paid for, and we sold it out and deposited the money in the bank from time to time as Clarkson & Company got it in.' Davidson, in his deposition, corroborates the testimony of Short in that regard . . . . Short testified that upon the acceptance by Clarkson & Company of the draft in question, and the delivery by that firm to the Port Arthur bank of the documents mentioned, Clarkson & Company took possession of the 35,312 quarter sacks of flour; and that they thereupon commenced selling it, and paying into the bank the proceeds thereof, is a fair inference from his testimony, as well as that of Davidson. It appears from the latter's testimony that, by reason of orders of the Russian military authorities, he was compelled to leave Port Arthur, and did so on the 17th of February, 1904.' After referring to the fact that Davidson was evidently confident that the steamer that brought the flour was the 'Pleiades' (the steamer that arrived in February, after the 'Hyades'), the court continued:-'but the flour itself, the witness distinctly testified, was sold by him before leaving Port Arthur to the firm of Ginsburg & Company, which he testified was a large Russian firm doing an extensive business with the Port Arthur bank, and with its principal place of business at that place, and which sale he testified he had to make in order to protect Clarkson & Company against the war conditions then prevailing. His testimony is, in \n\n[241 U.S. 403, 413]\n\u00a0\n part, that he arranged with Ginsburg & Company to pay a part of the money for which he sold the flour into the Port Arthur bank, and to take a draft from that company on Shanghai in his favor, which he intended to pay into Clarkson & Company's branch at that place, and that he took the head of the firm, Ginsburg, to the Port Arthur bank, and explained to the manager of that bank the terms of the sale, to which he agreed. Short testified that the Pleiades arrived at Port Arthur about the 7th of February, and that he himself left there on board of that vessel, and that not more than 1,500 or 2,000 sacks of flour were landed at Port Arthur from that ship, so that the jury might well have concluded that the 35,000 or 40,000 sacks of flour which Davidson thought were brought by the Pleiades was the consignment of flour that the Hyades carried to that port a few weeks before. As a matter of course that, and all other inconsistencies in the testimony of the various witnesses, as well as their veracity, were matters for the determination of the jury, in the light of all of the facts and circumstances of the case. Moreover, there was testimony tending to show that from the 1st of January, 1904, to November 23d of the same year, Clarkson & Company paid into the Port Arthur bank 126,928 roubles and 97 kopeks.' 109 C. C. A. 439-441, 206 Fed. pp. 651-653.\n\n We agree with the court of appeals that the special finding of the jury was adequately supported. Error is assigned with respect to the following instruction to the jury:\n'If you find from the evidence in this case that plaintiff permitted Clarkson Company to take over the flour under such an arrangement as the defendant claims with the stipulation that the plaintiff was the owner of the flour and with the agreement that Clarkson & Company would account to the plaintiff for the proceeds of the sale of the flour, then I instruct you that such action on the part of the plaintiff constitutes in law a payment of the draft in que- \n\n[241 U.S. 403, 414]\n\u00a0\n stion and the plaintiff cannot recover and your verdict must be for the defendant.'\n\n It is said by the petitioner that 'if we assume that the Port Arthur branch did, contrary to its instructions, permit Clarkson to take over the flour, then to the extent of the value of the security that was thereby released it may have been responsible.' But it is argued that 'although the bank did without warrant release the security,' still no damage resulted to the Seattle bank if Clarkson & Company were in fact able to pay their draft, and that there was abundant evidence that Clarkson's financial standing in Port Arthur at this time was good; and that in any event the debt could not be deemed to be paid to a greater extent than the value of the property. The trial court, it is insisted, in effect directed a finding of payment, if the jury found that the agreement was made as described, regardless of this value.\n This criticism of the instruction fails, we think, to take proper account of its context. Immediately following the words quoted, the court said:\n'It is a general rule of law that where collateral security is received for a debt with power to convert the security into money, this is specifically applicable to the payment of such debt; the same person being the party to pay and receive, no act is necessary and the law makes the application. If the proceeds equal or exceed the amount of the debt it is de facto paid; no action would lie for it, and proof of these facts would support the defense of payment. And if you find from the evidence in this case that the plaintiff did consent to Clarkson taking over the flour in question and consented to the sale of the same by Clarkson & Company, and then Clarkson & Company sold the flour in question and paid over the proceeds thereof to the plaintiff, then such payment of the proceeds of the sale of such flour to the plaintiff operated as a payment of the draft in question,-provided the proceeds \n\n[241 U.S. 403, 415]\n\u00a0\n of the sale of the flour equaled the amount of the draft; and if such proceeds did not equal or exceed the amount of the debt then it was a payment pro tanto-that is a payment of so much of the said draft as the proceeds of the sale of the flour would pay of the same; and this is the law, notwithstanding the fact that plaintiff may have received the proceeds of the sale of said flour and placed the same to the credit of Clarkson & Company in its bank, and permitted Clarkson & Company to use said funds for other purposes.'\n\n In this, the trial judge made his meaning sufficiently clear. If the proceeds of the sale under the agreement were to be payment only if they 'equaled the amount of the draft,' and otherwise were to be 'payment pro tanto,' plainly the agreement itself was not to be treated as constituting payment regardless of the value of the flour. Taking the instructions on this point in their entirety we think that their fair import was that the finding of payment in consequence of the stated arrangement was to be reached only in case the value of the flour was not less than the amount of the draft.\n Moreover, the record does not disclose a controversy as to the value of the flour. The evidence as to this amply supported a finding that the flour was at least worth the amount of the draft, and indeed it could not be said that a different conclusion would have had adequate support in the proof. Mr. Friedburg, officer of the Russo-Chinese Bank, testified that he did not know 'the price of the flour,' but that, so far as he knew, 'during the siege of Port Arthur the price of flour was a little higher than before the outbreak of the war, but there was a lot of flour in the go-downs of the government and no scarcity was felt of it.' Mr. Clarkson testified, referring to the Ginsburg sale: 'The first I heard was that the flour had been sold at two roubles a sack. I firmly believe at that time, that as war had broken out, the flour that \n\n[241 U.S. 403, 416]\n\u00a0\n was in Port Arthur at the time was worth fully Rbls. 3.00 a sack; consequently I considered that any sale made at Rbls. 2. was at least one rouble below the market value. To the best of my knowledge and belief the selling price before hostilities commenced was from Rbls. 2.50 to Rbls. 2. 60 a sack. . . . Acting under instructions from me, the bank in Port Arthur refused to let Ginsburg & Company have the flour at Rbls. 2.00, whereupon Ginsburg & Company agreed to pay Rbls. 2.40.' Mr. Short, when asked 'the market price of the flour' at the time he left, said: 'It was selling from two forty to two sixty-five roubles a sack.' Mr. Davidson testified that there was 'no market price of flour at that time;' but when asked whether 'there were not two separate bills of sale' made by him to Ginsburg & Company for that flour, one at 2. roubles and the other at 2.40 roubles,' he answered that it was 'quite true there were two prices' arranged by him, and that 'the lower price was sufficient to meet the draft.' He added: 'I made the sale to Ginsburg & Company at what I considered a fair market value under the circumstances; namely, that I had to leave Port Arthur, and that there was no one there I considered eligible to succeed me. The profit was 20 to 25 per cent, as near as I can remember.' It cannot be said that the evidence warranted a finding that the value of the flour was less than the amount of the draft.\n The Russo-Chinese Bank received the draft, with documents attached, for collection. It was instructed that 'documents are to be delivered on payment.' It was on these terms that it was intrusted with the bill of lading, indorsed in blank, which represented the flour. It was its plain duty not to permit Clarkson & Company, upon whom the draft was drawn, to have the control and disposition of the flour until the draft was paid. See Milwaukee Nat. Bank v. City Bank, \n103 \nU.S. 668, 670\n, 671 S., 26 L. ed. 417, 418. It is no answer to say that Clarkson & Company were the agents of the steamship \n\n[241 U.S. 403, 417]\n\u00a0\n company, for, while they might be able to obtain custody of the flour, it would only be in their capacity as such agents, and without the right of disposition. Nor was the case altered by the acceptance of the draft, for the condition attached to the delivery of the flour with the jus disponendi was payment, not acceptance. If, in these circumstances, the bank entered into an agreement with Clarkson & Company, as was testified, that the latter were to take over the flour and sell it, promising to account for the proceeds, this was manifestly a misappropriation of the property, and there arose in consequence liability to account for its value. This action was brought by the Russo-Chinese Bank to recover money which it had paid to the Seattle bank, and, with respect neither to the express promise to refund nor the promise implied in law, can it be said that the plaintiff was entitled to succeed if, at the time of the payment to the Seattle bank, it paid merely what it owed. There is no theory which permits it to recover, save that it paid under a mistake of fact; that is, that upon the actual facts it was not liable to make the payment it did make. If, however, it appeared that the value of the flour was equal to the amount of the draft, and it was found that the bank, contrary to its instructions, had permitted Clarkson & Company to take and dispose of the flour, it would necessarily follow that the Russo-Chinese Bank was accountable to the Seattle bank to the amount of the draft, and was in the same position, so far as the right of the Seattle bank against it was concerned, as if it had received the avails of the draft. It could not, by an agreement in violation of its duty, invest Clarkson & Company with the right of disposition, without accountability. The instruction, to which we have referred, affords no ground for reversal.\n Error is also assigned with respect to the instruction to the jury that the Russo-Chinese Bank became invested with the title and ownership of the flour, and that it could \n\n[241 U.S. 403, 418]\n\u00a0\n not be excused from an obligation to account by saying that the flour had disappeared without its knowledge. It is argued that the relation between the banks was that of principal and agent, not of vendor and vendee; that it took the draft for collection. But the charge, as we view it, was not to the effect that the relation of vendor and vendee was created, but, on the contrary, it was distinctly stated to the jury that the Russo-Chinese Bank 'was obligated as an agent to act in good faith and protect the rights of the National Bank of Commerce in the collection of the draft,' and that, as 'the agent' for the owner, it 'was obligated to account for the amount of the draft, to account for the security which the bill of lading constituted.' In view of the special finding that the draft had been paid, it is not necessary to inquire as to whether there would otherwise have been liability on the part of the plaintiff because of a failure to exercise reasonable care. The special finding, supported by adequate evidence, was based, under the instructions of the court, upon the transaction with Clarkson & Company to which we have referred, and it must be deemed controlling. We find no instruction with reference to that transaction, or its legal effect if found to be as testified, which was prejudicial to the plaintiff.\n Complaint is also made with respect to certain requests for instructions and rulings on the admission of evidence, but they are wholly without merit and it is unnecessary to review them. It is said that the Seattle bank suffered no loss because it had a guaranty from the Centennial Mill Company; but the Seattle bank, in view of its relation to the commercial paper involved, was entitled to demand an accounting from its correspondent, and on the same ground to resist this action for the recovery back of the money which it had received upon the draft.\n As we discover no error in the record, the judgment must be affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For convenience, we give the dates 'New Style.' \n\n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAN ANTONIO & A. P. R. CO. v. WAGNER(1916)\nNo. 311\nArgued: Decided: June 5, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 476, 477]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert J. Boyle, Rufus S. Day, Samuel Herrick, and A. B. Storey for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. H. C. Carter, Perry J. Lewis, and John Sehorn for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n The judgment that is brought under review by this writ of error is the outcome of an action begun in the district court of Bexar county, Texas, by defendant in error against plaintiff in error, resulting in a judgment in his favor. This was affirmed by the court of civil appeals, a rehearing was denied (166 S. W. 24, 28), and our writ of error is directed to that court because the supreme court of Texas refused to review the judgment.\n We shall describe the parties according to their attitude in the trial court. Plaintiff's petition alleged that on October 18, 1911, he was employed as a brakeman by defendant, a common carrier by railroad engaged in both interstate and intrastate commerce; that defendant had in use in both kinds of commerce a certain engine and a \n\n[241 U.S. 476, 478]\n\u00a0\n certain car, and it became plaintiff's duty to couple them together; that the couplers would not couple automatically by impact, as required by law, 'and for the purpose of making said coupling it became necessary for the plaintiff to stand upon the footboard of said engine, between said engine and car, and to shove the knuckle of the coupler on said engine so as to bring it into proper position to make the coupling as aforesaid;' that plaintiff placed his left foot against the knuckle of the coupler of the engine for the purpose of pushing it into position, when he lost his balance, slipped and fell, and his left foot was caught between the couplers and crushed. Defendant interposed a general denial and certain special defenses, which latter were struck out on demurrer. They set up that defendant was a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce, and invoked the provisions of the Federal safety appliance act of March 2, 1893 (chap. 196, 27 Stat. at L. 531, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8605), and the amendment of March 2, 1903 (chap. 976, 32 Stat. at L. 943, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8613), averring that all couplers attached to railroad engines, tenders, or cars must have sufficient lateral motion to permit trains to round the curves, and must be provided with adjustable knuckles which can be opened and closed, and such couplers must be adjusted at times in order that they may couple automatically by impact, and that there is no kind of automatic coupler constructed or that can be constructed which will couple automatically at all times without previous adjustment, because of the lateral play necessary to enable coupled cars to round curves; that the engine and car upon which plaintiff was employed at the time of his injury were engaged in interstate commerce, and were equipped with automatic couplers which would couple automatically by impact as required by the acts of Congress, but an adjustment was necessary for this purpose, and could have been made by the plaintiff going between the cars while they were standing, but without going between the ends of the cars while in motion, or \n\n[241 U.S. 476, 479]\n\u00a0\n between a moving engine and cars, and without kicking the coupling or in any manner endangering his own personal safety; with more to the same effect.\n At the trial the evidence tended to show that plaintiff was engaged in switching at one of defendant's yards, and was riding upon the footboard at the rear of the engine in order to make a coupling between it and a box car; that at the first impact-to use plaintiff's words-'the coupling wouldn't make; I coupled up against them but it wouldn't make.' He then signaled the engineer to draw ahead, and this having been done, he adjusted the knuckle and pin upon the box car, and 'I gave the engineer a back-up signal to couple in again, and I got back on the footboard of the engine; when I got on the footboard I looked down and I seen the drawhead on the engine was shifted way over to my side, and I reached up with my left foot to shift the drawhead over so it would couple, and my right foot slipped on the wet footboard;' as a result of which his left foot was caught between the drawheads and crushed. He testified that at the first impact the drawhead on the engine was in line with that on the box car, and that the only thing that prevented the coupling at this time was the failure of the pin on the box car to drop. And further: 'When the coupling apparatus of these automatic couplers are in proper condition and they are properly connected, they couple by impact automatically; . . . when the brakeman couples a car, he pulls a lever on the outside of the car; that opens the knuckle-that raises the pin and opens the coupler up; then all he has to do is to give a signal and they back right up. He has nothing to do with reference to fixing the knuckle, or anything of that sort.' He testified in effect that the coupler was out of order. The court of civil appeals held that, so far as this was opinion evidence, it was admissible as the opinion of a qualified expert, plaintiff having been employed by defendant as a brakeman for eight years, and being acquainted with the \n\n[241 U.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n operation of couplers. A witness called by defendant testified: 'These couplers are made to couple automatically by impact,-they are supposed to be in such condition as that, so when they come together they will couple without the necessity of men going in between the cars to couple or uncouple, and should be in that condition. If they do not couple with the automatic impact, they are not in proper condition.'\n The trial court instructed the jury that if the locomotive and car in question were not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact without the necessity of plaintiff going between the ends of the cars, and by reason of this and as a proximate result of it plaintiff received his injuries, the verdict should be in his favor; otherwise in favor of defendant; and that the burden of proof was upon plaintiff to establish his case by a preponderance of the evidence.\n The court of civil appeals treated the case as coming within the Federal employers' liability act of April 22, 1908 (chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657), and the assignments of error in this court and the argument thereon proceed upon that basis. We shall decide the case upon that assumption, although we find nothing in the record to show that, in fact, plaintiff was employed in interstate commerce at the time he was injured. We are asked to take notice of the omission of pleading and proof of the fact as a 'plain error,' and deal with it, although not assigned, under paragraph 4 of our Rule 21. We must decline to do this, principally for two reasons: (a) The omission may have been due to an oversight that would have been corrected if the point had been properly raised by the present plaintiff in error in the state courts. (b) Since the safety appliance acts are in any event applicable,-defendant's railroad being admittedly a highway of interstate commerce,-whether plaintiff was employed in such commerce or not (Texas & P. R. Co. v. Rigsby, \n241 U.S. 33\n, \n\n[241 U.S. 476, 481]\n\u00a0\n 42, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 482), the only materiality of the question whether the employers' liability act also applies is in its bearing upon the defense of contributory negligence; the former act leaving that defense untouched (Schlemmer v. Buffalo, R. & P. R. Co. \n220 \nU.S. 590, 596\n, 55 S. L. ed. 596, 600, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 561), while the latter ( 3, 35 Stat. at L. 66, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8659) abolishes it in any case where the violation by the carrier of a statute enacted for the safety of employees may contribute to the injury or death of an employee, and in other cases limits its effect to the diminution of the damages. Now, an examination of the record discloses that defendant at the trial raised no question of contributory negligence. Such negligence was averred in the special defenses that were struck out, but not as constituting a defense against a violation of the safety appliance acts; and the special defenses contained an allegation to the effect that, at the time of his injury, plaintiff was engaged in interstate commerce. In this state of the record, we do not deem it proper to consider the omission to plead or prove that plaintiff's injury occurred in interstate commerce, as a ground for reversing the judgment, it not having been made the basis of any assignment of error.\n In the court of civil appeals, as in this court, error was assigned upon the action of the trial court in striking out the special defenses. The appellate court held, however, that, under the general denial, defendant was at liberty to show all that had been averred in the special defenses respecting the couplers, and that it was permitted to prove all that it offered upon that subject. It is insisted here, and the insistence is many times repeated, that the trial court refused to admit in evidence testimony offered to show that all automatic couplers necessarily require adjustment at times in order that they may operate automatically upon impact, and that the adjustment is accomplished by means of hand levers fitted to the cars and operated by the trainmen without going between the cars; the object being to show that the engine and car \n\n[241 U.S. 476, 482]\n\u00a0\n were equipped as required by law, and that the drawbar on the engine was thrown out of line by reason of plaintiff's failure to use the hand lever on the box car in preparation for the first impact. It is insisted, also, that certain testimony with reference to adjusting couplers on engines and cars, made necessary by lateral play, in order that they might couple automatically by impact, having been admitted, was afterwards excluded as inadmissible. There is nothing in the certified transcript to sustain either of these contentions. There is an assertion to the same effect in the motion for rehearing filed in the court of civil appeals, where it was stated that the exclusion of the testimony would be made to appear by reference to the stenographer's official report of the trial. The court of civil appeals declared, however, that no such document had been filed or would be filed in that court; proceeding thus: 'This cause has been considered on the agreed statement of facts, approved by the trial judge, and the effect of such statement of facts cannot be impaired or destroyed by a document not filed among the papers, and which has no place among the papers. The statement of facts bears out the statement of this court that appellant was permitted to introduce all the testimony it desired on the subject of the coupler on the engine. The record fails to show that any testimony offered by appellant was withdrawn by the court from the jury.'\n Eliminating, therefore, because unsupported by anything in the record, the insistence that appellant was deprived of the opportunity of presenting at the trial the matters that had been set up in the special defenses, the remaining questions are few and easily disposed of.\n There was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in finding that the coupler upon the box car or that upon the engine, or both, were in bad repair, and that for this reason they did not measure up to the standard prescribed by the act of March 2, 1893, for such equipment, \n\n[241 U.S. 476, 483]\n\u00a0\n viz.: 'Couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars.' This standard was, by the 1st section of the 1903 amendment, made to apply 'in all cases, whether or not the couplers brought together are of the same kind, make, or type;' and was extended to 'all trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce, . . . and to all other locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used in connection therewith,' subject to an exception not now material. As has been held repeatedly, this amendment enlarged the scope of the original act so as to embrace all locomotives, cars, and similar vehicles used on any railway that is a highway of interstate commerce, whether the particular vehicles are at the time employed in interstate commerce or not. Southern R. Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20, 26\n, 56 S. L. ed. 72, 74, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 2, 3 N. C. C. A. 822; Texas & P. R. Co. v. Rigsby, \n241 \nU.S. 33, 37\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 482.\n That the act requires locomotives to be equipped with automatic couplers, and that its protection extends to men when coupling as well as when uncoupling cars, are points set at rest by Johnson v. Southern P. Co. \n196 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 18 S., 49 L. ed. 363, 368, 369, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158, 17 Am. Neg. Rep. 412.\n It is insisted that neither the original act nor the amendment precludes adjustment of the coupler prior to or at the time of impact, or treats a drawbar out of alignment as a defect in the automatic coupler, or as evidence that the cars are not equipped with couplers measuring up to the statutory standard. The evidence of bad repair in the automatic equipment was not confined to the fact that the drawbar on the engine was out of line; the fact that the coupling pin on the box car failed to drop as it should have done at the first impact, and required manipulation in preparation for the second impact, together with the fact that the drawbar on the engine was so far out of line as to require adjustment in preparation for the second \n\n[241 U.S. 476, 484]\n\u00a0\n impact, and the opinion evidence, being sufficient to sustain a finding that the equipment was defective. The jury could reasonably find that the misalignment of the drawbar was greater than required to permit the rounding of curves, or, if not, that an adjusting lever should have been provided upon the engine as upon the car, and that there was none upon the engine. We need not in this case determine, what was conceded in Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Brown, \n229 \nU.S. 317, 320\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1204, 1205, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 840, 3 N. C. C. A. 826, that the failure of a coupler to work at any time sustains a charge that the act has been violated.\n It is argued that in actions based upon the employers' liability act the defendant cannot be held liable without evidence of negligence; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 501\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1062, 1068, L.R.A.1915C, 1, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475, 8 N. C. C. A. 834, being cited. But in that case, as the opinion shows (p. 507), there was no question of a violation of any provision of the safety appliance act; and in what was said (p. 501) respecting the necessity of showing negligence, reference was had to causes of action independent of that act. The employers' liability act, as its 4th section very clearly shows, recognizes that rights of action may arise out of the violation of the safety appliance act. As was stated in Texas & P. R. Co. v. Rigsby, \n241 \nU.S. 33, 39\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 482, 484,-'A disregard of the command of the statute [safety appliance act] is a wrongful act, and where it results in damage to one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted, the right to recover the damages from the party in default is implied.' If this act is violated, the question of negligence in the general sense of want of care is immaterial. \n241 U.S. 43\n, and cases there cited. But the two statutes are in pari materia, and where the employers' liability act refers to 'any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances,' etc., it clearly is the legislative intent to treat a violation of the safety appliance act as 'negligence,'-what is sometimes called negligence per se. \n\n[241 U.S. 476, 485]\n\u00a0\n In various forms plaintiff in error raises the contention that it was plaintiff's improper management of the coupling operation that was the proximate cause of his injury. But any misconduct on his part was no more than contributory negligence, which, as already shown, is, by the employers' liability act, excluded from consideration in a case such as this.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","165":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSEABOARD AIR LINE RY. v.

On the bill, answer, and on agreed facts the court refused an injunction on the ground that there was no contract right in existence, and, treating this conclusion as going to the vitals of the whole case, dismissed the bill, and a direct appeal was taken.\n Although there are fourteen assignments of error, but one question arises: Was there a contract? since, leaving out mere forms of statement, all the assignments concern this single question, and we come to its solution. In doing \n\n[242 U.S. 15, 17]\n\u00a0\n so, to avoid that which is superfluous, we concede, for the sake of the argument only, that the city had the lawful authority to make a contract concerning the track on the street and sidewalk in question. With this argumentative concession the question then is, not what there was power to do, but what was done; and to solve it requires a brief statement.\n In 1835 the Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company, to whose rights it is conceded the complainant and appellant succeeded, was authorized to and shortly afterwards built a railroad from Gaston to Raleigh, North Carolina. Entering the latter city through its streets with its consent, and building therein machine shops, a railroad yard, and other facilities, the main tracks of the railroad curved into a block which the company had bought and upon which it established its terminals, bounded on the front or west by Salisbury street, on the rear or east by Halifax street, and on the north and south by North and Lane streets. Many years subsequently, in 1881, on the block just below and on the same side of Salisbury street, a cotton compress had been built, fronting on Salisbury street and abutting on the sidewalk on that street. In that year the railroad company asked permission of the city authorities to extend a track to and along the sidewalk on the block in front of the compress, which was granted, the official record of the consent of the city having been manifested by the following entry in the minutes of the board of aldermen: 'Upon application of John C. Winder, General Superintendent, the Raleigh & Gaston Railroad Company was granted permission to occupy the sidewalk on the east side of Salisbury street, between Jones and Lane streets, for the purpose of running a track.' In virtue of this consent a spur track projecting from the main tracks as they curved into the terminal block was built which ran down to and upon the sidewalk in front of the compress. For \n\n[242 U.S. 15, 18]\n\u00a0\n many years this track was used for business going in and out of the compress, as well as for the general purposes of the railroad. In 1906, however, the compress ceased to be operated, and subsequently (about 1910 or 1911) the railroad company, owning the block on which the compress was situated, removed the same and built upon the block a warehouse. It was not possible, however, from the track on the sidewalk to directly reach such warehouse, as, along the block where it fronted on Salisbury street, tracks were laid between the warehouse and the spur track, which, for the purposes of the railroad, were depressed below the level of the street and sidewalk, and thus the spur track on the sidewalk was only available for parking cars, or as a team track, and was alternately in use for one or the other of these purposes when the city adopted the assailed ordinance directing the removal of the spur track.\n Under this statement it becomes at once apparent that the court below rightly decided that the contract right asserted had no existence, since, on the very face of the consent which was given, a mere right to occupy was conveyed, without any contract as to time, and which therefore, taking the best view for the railroad, amounted to conferring upon it a mere license to put and use a track upon the sidewalk, and therefore subject to the power of the city to revoke whenever it deemed the municipal interest required it to do so.\n But the contention is that, although it be conceded that the well- settled rule is that general implications may not be resorted to for the purpose of converting a grant of a municipality which is, upon its face, a mere license, into a contract for a stated period or in perpetuity, nevertheless that rule is subject to a well-defined limitation or exception which, as presented in the argument in various forms, may be stated as follows: That where general powers are conferred and duties are imposed upon \n\n[242 U.S. 15, 19]\n\u00a0\n a corporation which, from their nature and essential character, presuppose the right to exert them or the duty to perform them during a specified time or in perpetuity, and a particular power or right is conferred on the corporation which has a necessary relation thereto or an essential connection therewith, although such particular power or right may not have expressly taken the form of contract or grant for a stated time or in perpetuity, nevertheless such result may be implied by considering the essential relation which the particular power or right granted bears to the general powers and duties possessed and the necessary connection between the two for the purpose of giving a common duration to both.

Cas. 1915A, 906.\n But while the general rule is well founded and the exception or limitation by which it is asserted to be qualified is well settled, it has no relation to the case in hand, since the particular action of the city in question concerned a mere permission to exercise a facility as a license, given long after the creation of the railway corporation, and not inherently or in any degree necessarily controlling its power to discharge its corporate attributes. Indeed, so much is this the case on the face of the situation here presented that it becomes apparent that to apply the limitation to a case like this would destroy the general rule itself.\n The contention that even though this be the case, in as mcuh as the railroad had for a long time operated the spur track on the sidewalk and used it for its general railroad purposes with the assumed knowledge and assent of the city, thereby the existence of a contractual and permanent right must be inferred, is manifestly without* \n\n[242 U.S. 15, 20]\n\u00a0\n merit. Indeed, it amounts to saying that possession under a mere license was capable of causing that which was revocable and precarious to become contractual and permanent.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSEABOARD AIR LINE RY. v. HORTON(1916)\nNo. 541\nArgued: Decided: January 10, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[239 U.S. 595, 596]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Murray Allen for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Clyde A. Douglass and William C. Douglass for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action, based upon the Federal employers' liability act (35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, 36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8662), was under consideration on a former occasion, when a judgment in favor of defendant in error was reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings. \n233 U.S. 492\n, 58 L. ed. 1062, L.R.A.1915C, 1, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475, 8 N. C. C. A. 834. There was a new trial, and the resulting judgment in favor \n\n[239 U.S. 595, 597]\n\u00a0\n of Horton, the employee, having been affirmed by the supreme court of North Carolina (85 S. E. 218), the case is brought here again, with numerous assignments of error, of which, however, only a few need be noticed.\n Plaintiff was injured while in the employ of defendant in interstate commerce. He was an experienced locomotive engineer, and was so employed when injured. His engine was equipped with a Buckner water gauge, a device attached to the boiler head for the purpose of showing the level of the water in the boiler, and consisting of a brass frame inclosing a glass tube 12 or 14 inches long, and 1\/2 inch in diameter, the glass being about 3\/8 inch thick. The tube was placed vertically, and was connected with the boiler above and below, so that it received water and steam direct from the boiler and under a pressure of 200 pounds. In order to protect the engineer and fireman from injury in case of the bursting of the tube, a thick piece of plain glass, known as a guard glass, should have been in position in slots arranged for the purpose in front of the water tube. Plaintiff took charge of the engine in question in July 27 or 28, 1910, and noticed at that time that the guard glass was missing. He reported this to a roundhouse foreman, to whom such report should properly be made, and asked for a new guard glass. The foreman replied that he had none in stock, but would send for one, and that plaintiff in the meantime should run the engine without one. He did so for about a week, and until August 4th, when the water tube exploded, and the flying glass struck him in the face, causing the injuries upon which the action was grounded.\n The principal insistence of defendant (plaintiff in error) is that, upon all the evidence, plaintiff, as a matter of law, assumed the risk of injury arising from the absence of the guard glass. The rule applicable to the situation was expressed by this court upon the former review of the case, in the following terms (\n233 U.S. 504\n): 'When the \n\n[239 U.S. 595, 598]\n\u00a0\n employee does know of the defect [arising from the employer's negligence], and appreciates the risk that is attributable to it, then if he continues in the employment, without objection, or without obtaining from the employer or his representative an assurance that the defect will be remedied, the employee assumes the risk, even though it arise out of the master's breach of duty. If, however, there be a promise of reparation, then during such time as may be reasonably required for its performance, or until the particular time specified for its performance, the employee, relying upon the promise, does not assume the risk unless at least the danger be so imminent that no ordinarily prudent man under the circumstances would rely upon such promise.'\n By motions for nonsuit and for dismissal of the action, and by various requests for instructions to the jury, all of which were refused, defendant raised the point that although plaintiff reported the absence of the guard glass to defendant's foreman and received a promise of repair, yet the danger was so imminent that no ordinarily prudent man under the circumstances would have relied upon the promise, and hence plaintiff, as matter of law, assumed the risk of injury.\n But we do not think it can be said as matter of law that the danger was so imminent that no ordinarily prudent man under the circumstances would continue in the employment in reliance upon the promise. It was not the function of the guard glass to prevent the bursting of the water tube, but only to limit the effect of such an explosion in case it happened to occur. That there was a constant danger that the tube might explode was abundantly proved, and was admitted by plaintiff. But the tube was designed to withstand the pressure of 200 pounds, and ordinarily did so. It was its proper function to do so. One witness said: 'They may last a day, a week, a month, or a year, or it may last an hour, or shorter.' The jury \n\n[239 U.S. 595, 599]\n\u00a0\n might reasonably believe that such a water glass would probably not explode in the ordinary use of it unless it was imperfect or defective in some respect other than the absence of the guard glass, and that, since there was no evidence of this, Horton was justified in assuming that the danger of an explosion was not immediately threatening.\n There is a substantial difference in the attitude of the employee towards the known dangers arising out of defects attributable to the employer's negligence, depending upon whether there has or has not been a promise of repair. It was clearly expressed is a well-reasoned opinion by the supreme court of New Jersey (Dowd v. Erie R. Co. 70 N. J. L. 451, 455, 57 Atl. 248, 16 Am. Neg. Rep. 122) thus: 'To the rule that the servant assumes the obvious risks of the employment, an exception is made where the master has promised to amend the defect or to make the place safe, and the servant continues the work in reliance upon the promise. . . . The master is exempted from liability in the case of obvious risks for the reason that the servant, by continuing in the employment with knowledge of the danger, evinces a willingness to incur the risk, and upon the principle 'volenti non fit injuria.' But when the servant shows that he relied upon a promise made to him to remedy the defect, he negatives the inference of willingness to incur the risk.'\n To relieve the employer from responsibility for injuries that may befall the employee while remaining at his work in reliance upon a promise of reparation, there must be something more than knowledge by the employee that danger confronts him, or that it is constant. The danger must be imminent,-immediately threatening,-so as to render it clearly imprudent for him to confront it, even in the line of duty, pending the promise. The danger of the explosion of the water glass, which normally should withstand the pressure to which it was subjected, \n\n[239 U.S. 595, 600]\n\u00a0\n but which might probably explode at some time near or remote, cannot be said, as matter of law, to have been so imminent as to import an assumption of the risk by Horton notwithstanding the employer's promise to replace the guard glass. It would require a much plainer case than this to justify taking the question from the jury.\n It is insisted that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. This, also, is based upon the ground of the obvious and imminent nature of the danger to plaintiff arising out of the absence of the guard glass. But the reasonable reliance of the employee upon the employer's promise to repair the defect is as good an answer to the charge of contributory negligence as to the contention that the risk was assumed. The employer's direction or request that the employee remain at work pending performance of the promise has a material bearing upon the employee's duty in the meantime, and therefore upon the question of his negligence, which involves the notion of some fault or breach of duty on his part. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 503\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1062, 1069, L.R.A.1915C, 1, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475, 8 N. C. C. A. 834. Hence, the question of Horton's contributory negligence was at best a matter for the jury to determine.\n All the disputable questions of fact were submitted to the jury under instructions that were sufficiently favorable to defendant. The jury were told, in substance, that if they found the absence of the guard glass was known to plaintiff, and he reported the defect and was given a promise to repair, and if he knew and appreciated the danger incident thereto, and the danger was so obvious that a man of ordinary prudence would not have continued to use the water gauge without the guard glass, then the plaintiff assumed the risk. This was unduly favorable to defendant, in that it omitted to state that in order to qualify plaintiff's right to rely upon the \n\n[239 U.S. 595, 601]\n\u00a0\n promise of reparation the danger must be imminent as well as obvious. But, besides this, we deem it proper to say, in view of the fact that the instruction referred to seems to have been intended to conform to our opinion delivered upon the former writ of error, that we did not then intend to decide whether an employee remaining at work in reliance upon the employer's promise to repair a defective appliance, but where the danger known is so imminent that no ordinarily prudent man under the circumstances would remain at work in reliance upon the promise, should be held to assume the risk, or, rather, to be guilty of contributory negligence. What we said was that the employee, in the situation described, 'does not assume the risk unless, at least, the danger be so imminent,' etc. While most courts agree that an employee cannot, without impairing his right to recover from the employer, remain at work in the presence of a known danger so imminent that no reasonably prudent man would confront it, even where the employer has promised reparation, they differ as to whether this is to be placed upon the ground of assumption of risk or of contributory negligence. See Hough v. Texas & P. R. Co. \n100 \nU.S. 213, 224\n, 225 S., 25 L. ed. 612, 617, 618; Dowd v. Erie R. Co. 70 N. J. L. 451, 456, 57 Atl. 248, 16 Am. Neg. Rep. 122; Clarke v. Holmes, 7 Hurlst. & N. 937, 945, 31 L. J. Exch. N. S. 356, 8 Jur. N. S. 992, 10 Week. Rep. 405. The distinction, which was of little consequence when assumption of risk and contributory negligence led to the same result, becomes important in actions founded upon the Federal employers' liability act, which in ordinary cases recognizes assumption of risk as a complete bar to the action, while contributory negligence merely mitigates the damages, as was pointed out when the case was here before. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, supra. The disputable point above referred to was not then presented for decision. Nor is it now presented, for upon the last trial the court, in the instruction given to the jury, put the plaintiff (upon the hypothesis of his per- \n\n[239 U.S. 595, 602]\n\u00a0\n sisting in the face of an imminent danger, where a man of ordinary prudence would not) in the position of assuming the risk-a position more favorable to defendant (plaintiff in error) than that of contributory negligence.\n It is further argued that Horton's own conduct in using the Buckner gauge without the guard glass, when he could have cut this off and used the gauge cocks, said to be an entirely safe instrumentality, was unquestionably the proximate cause of his injury. But there was evidence to show that the gauge cocks themselves were not a safe instrumentality, because of their liability to become clogged. Hence, at the utmost, there was here no more than a question for the jury.\n Other points are raised, but they are quite unsubstantial, and require no particular mention.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSEABOARD AIR LINE RY. v. KENNEY(1916)\nNo. 269\nArgued: March 10, 1916Decided: April 3, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 489, 490]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Murray Allen for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 489, 491]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis D. Winston and J. H. Matthews for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The trial court on the verdict of a jury entered judgment against the plaintiff in error for the sum of $800 for the negligent killing of Capehart, who was one of its employees, and this writ of error is prosecuted to reverse the action of the court below, affirming such judgment. 167 N. C. 14, L.R.A. --, --, 82 S. E. 968. At the time of his death Capehart was a minor and was employed by the defendant company as a switchman. The accident occurred in North Carolina on an interstate freight train moving from a point in North Carolina to one in Virginia. The suit to recover was specifically based on the employers' liability act of April 22, 1908, 35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, as amended April 5, 1910, 36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8662, and as both parties concede that that act was applicable, that subject may be put out of view. \n\n[240 U.S. 489, 492]\n\u00a0\n The deceased was a natural or illegitimate child, born in North Carilina, and the next of kin for whose benefit the administrator sued, he having been qualified at the alleged domicil of the deceased in North Carolina, were three minor children of the deceased's mother, the issue of a marriage by her contracted after his birth, she, the mother, being dead at the time of the accident. child, born in North Carolina, and the next below as to nonliability because of an absence of negligence, since, as pointed out by the court, the sole contention pressed upon it for reversal was that the damages for the death had been awarded to persons who were not entitled to the recovery as next of kin under the act of Congress, even although they were the next of kin by the law of the state. Thus the court said: 'The sole contention of the defendant requiring our consideration is that the expression 'next of kin,' as used in  1 of this act [the act of Congress], is to be construed by the common law, disregarding the state law defining those words.' After then quoting from the state statute on the subject, the court further said: 'It is very clear that in North Carolina the two half brothers and the sister of the intestate are his next of kin. It seems to us immaterial whether it were formerly otherwise in this state, either by statute or the common law before any statute. The question is, Who was the 'next of kin' at the time of such death in the state where the wrongful death occurred?' Proceeding to examine and decide this question, it was held that next of kin for the purpose of the recovery under the act of Congress were the next of kin as established by the law of the state where the right to recover obtained. And it is the correctness of this ruling which we are alone called upon to consider, since, despite the great number of assignments of error which are made, they all in last analysis depend upon that question. We need not stop to review the assignments to demonstrate this fact, since in argument they are all stated as embracing the solution of three \n\n[240 U.S. 489, 493]\n\u00a0\n inquiries, which, as we shall see when we consider them, will be virtually disposed of by deciding the single question concerning the correctness of the ruling of the court below as to the next of kin under the statute. The three questions thus stated are in substance as follows: First, whether the minor children, who, under the law of North Carolina, were the next of kin of their natural or illegitimate brother, because of their common motherhood, were the the next of kin under the act of Congress? Second, if, in the absence of a parent, they were so, would the proof of the existence of an asserted father of the deceased make such person his parent within the act of Congress, excluding the right of the next of kin to recover the damages? Third, if the minor brothers and sister were next of kin under the act of Congress, had they such dependency on the deceased as gave them any right to recover under the act?\n We consider the questions separately.\n\n 1. \nThere can be now no question that the act of Congress in so far as it deals with the subjects to which it relates is paramount and exclusive. It is therefore not disputable that recovery under the act can be had alone in the mode and by and for the persons or class of persons in whose favor the law creates and bestows a right of action. Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York N. H. & H. R. Co.) \n223 U.S. 1\n, 56 L. ed. 327, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169, 1 N. C. C. A. 875; Michigan C. R. Co. v. Vreeland, \n227 U.S. 59\n, 57 L. ed. 417, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 179; Taylor v. Taylor, \n232 U.S. 363\n, 58 L. ed. 638, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350, 6 N. C. C. A. 436; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 501\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1062, 1068, L.R.A.1915C, 1, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475, 8 N. C. C. A. 834. But this is irrelevant, since the controversy concerns only the meaning of the act, which it is conceded, when rightly interpreted, is entitled to exclusive operation.\n Plainly the statute contains no definition of who are to constitute the next of kin to whom a right of recovery is granted. But, as speaking generally under our dual system of government, who are next of kin is determined by the legislation of the various states to whose authority that subject is normally committed, it would seem to be clear that the absence of a definition in the act of Congress \n\n[240 U.S. 489, 494]\n\u00a0\n plainly indicates the purpose of Congress to leave the determination of that question to the state law. But, it is urged, as next of kin was a term well known at common law, it is to be presumed that the words were used as having their common-law significance, and therefore as excluding all persons not included in the term under the common law; meaning, of course, the law of England as it existed at the time of the separation from the mother country. Leaving aside the misapplication of the rule of construction relied upon, it is obvious that the contention amounts to saying that Congress, by the mere statement of a class, that is, next of kin, without defining whom the class embraces, must be assumed to have overthrown the local law of the states, and substituted another law for it; when conceding that there was power in Congress to do so, it is clear that no such extreme result could possibly be attributed to the act of Congress without express and unambiguous provisions rendering such conclusion necessary. The truth of this view will be made at once additionally apparent by considering the far-reaching consequence of the proposition, since, if it be well founded, it would apply equally to the other requirements of the statute,-to the provisions as to the surviving widow, the husband and children, and to parents, thus, for the purposes of the enforcement of the act, overthrowing the legislation of the states on subjects of the most intimate domestic character, and substituting for it the common law as stereotyped at the time of the separation. The argument that such result must have been intended, since it is to be assumed that Congress contemplated uniformity, that is, that the next of kin entitled to take under the statute should be uniformly applied in all the states, after all comes to saying that it must be assumed that Congress intended to create a uniformity on one subject by producing discord and want of uniformity as to many others.\n But we need go no further, since the want of merit in the \n\n[240 U.S. 489, 495]\n\u00a0\n contention is fully demonstrated by authority. In Hutchinson Invest. Co. v. Caldwell, \n152 U.S. 65\n, 38 L. ed. 356, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 504, the matter under consideration was  2269, Revised Statutes, giving to the heirs of a deceased pre-emptor who had died before completing his entry the right to perfect the same, the statute providing: 'But the entry in such cases shall be made in favor of the heirs of the deceased pre-emptor, and a patent thereon shall cause the title to inure to such heirs, as if their names had been specially mentioned.' The controversy was whether the word 'heirs' under the statute should be taken in its common-law meaning, and therefore not to give a right to complete the entry to illegitimate children who had been recognized by their father, the preemptor, and who were his heirs under the 'law of the state of Kansas, where the land was stipulated and where the deceased preemptor was domiciled. The court said: 'We are unable to concur with counsel for plaintiffs in error that the intention should be ascribed to Congress of limiting the words 'heirs of the deceased pre-emptor' as used in the section to persons who would be heirs at common law (children not born in lawful matrimony being, therefore, excluded), rather than those who might be such according to the lex rei sitae, by which, generally speaking, the question of the descent and heirship of real estate is exclusively governed. If such had been the intention, it seems clear that a definition of the word 'heirs' would have been given, so as to withdraw patents issued under this section from the operation of the settled rule upon the subject. . . . But it is contended that the word 'heirs' was used in its common-law sense, and it is true that technical legal terms are usually taken, in the absence of a countervailing intent, in their established common-law signification; but that consideration has no controlling weight in the construction of this statute. Undoubtedly the word 'heirs' was used as meaning, as at common law, those capable of inheriting, but it does not follow that the question as \n\n[240 U.S. 489, 496]\n\u00a0\n to who possessed that capability was thereby designed to be determined otherwise than by the law of the state which was both the situs of the land and the domicil of the owner.' pp. 68, 69. And there is no ground for taking this case out of the rule thus announced upon the theory that the controversy involved the title to real estate, contracts concerning which are governed by the law of the situs, since we are dealing here with the subject of next of kin, which, so far as legislative power is concerned, under our constitutional system of government, is inherently local and to be determined by the rules of the local law. And this is well illustrated by Blagge v. Blach, \n162 U.S. 439\n, 40 L. ed. 1032, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 853, which involved a controversy as to the distribution of French spoliation claims awarded under an act of Congress providing 'that in all cases where the original sufferers were adjudicated bankrupts the awards shall be made on behalf of the next of kin instead of to assignees in bankruptcy. . . .' [ 26 Stat. at L. 908, chap. 540.] Without going into detail concerning the controversy in that case it suffices to say that if the next of kin entitled to take under the act of Congress had been ascertained under the rule of the common law, there would have been one result, and if determined by the law of the state controlling distributions, another and different result followed. Coming to determine the significance of the words 'next of kin' from the act itself and its context, the court said: 'And we are of opinion that Congress, in order to reach the next of kin of the original sufferers, capable of taking at the time of distribution, on principles universally accepted as most just and equitable, intended next of kin according to the statutes of distribution of the respective states of the domicil of the original sufferers.'\n 2 and 3. The suggestion rather than contention that if the state law be held applicable to determine next of kin, the right should have been recognized to seek to trace the paternity of the illegitimate child, so as to make the \n\n[240 U.S. 489, 497]\n\u00a0\n asserted father the parent under the statute, might well be disposed of by saying that no such contention seems to have been urged in either of the courts below. But, aside from this, the entire want of merit of the proposition is at once demonstrable from a twofold point of view: (a) Because it was necessarily foreclosed by the ruling of the court below as to the state law concerning the next of kin and the right of the brothers and sister of the illegitimate child to inherit from him solely because of a common motherhood,-a ruling which excluded by necessary implication the right now contended for. (b) Because as no provision, either of the state law or of the common law, supporting the asserted right, is referred to, the suggestion may be taken as simply a typical illustration of the confusion of thought involved in the main proposition relied upon which we have previously viously adversely disposed of.\n In so far as it is suggested that there was no proof tending to show a dependent relation between the next of kin who were recognized and the deceased, so as to justify recovery under the statute, it suffices to say that it was expressly foreclosed by the finding of the jury, sanctioned by the trial court, and was not questioned in the court below, and at all events involves but a controversy as to the tendencies of all the proof, foreclosed by the action of both courts, which we would not reverse without a clear conviction of error, which, after an examination of the record on the subject, we do not entertain.

The facts being established, the question then presented is whether, as matter of law, there is sufficient evidence to support a finding of public necessity,-the mere declaration of a Commission is not conclusive.

The plaintiff had a verdict and judgment under the employers' liability act of Congress (chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657; chap. 143, 36 Stat. at L. 291), the judgment was affirmed (-- N. C. --, 86 S. E. 964), and the defendant brings the case here.\n The original complaint was exceedingly brief and did \n\n[241 U.S. 290, 293]\n\u00a0\n not sufficiently allege that at the time of the injury the defendant was engaged and the plaintiff employed in interstate commerce. During the trial the defendant sought some advantage from this, and the court, over the defendant's objection, permitted the complaint to be so amended as to state distinctly the defendant's engagement and the plaintiff's employment in such commerce. Both parties conceded that what was alleged in the amendment was true in fact and conformed to the proofs, and that point has since been treated as settled. The defendant's objection was that the original complaint did not state a cause of action under the act of Congress, that with the amendment the complaint would state a new cause of action under that act, and that, as more than two years had elapsed since the right of action accrued, the amendment could not be made the medium of introducing this new cause of action consistently with the provision in  6 that 'no action shall be maintained under this act unless commenced within two years from the day the cause of action acrued.' Whether in what was done this restriction was in effect disregarded is a Federal question and subject to re-examination here, however much the allowance of the amendment otherwise might have rested in discretion or been a matter of local procedure.

L. ed. 248, 251, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 58. The original complaint set forth that the defendant was operating a line of railroad in Virginia, North Carolina, and elsewhere; that the plaintiff was in its employ; that when he was injured he was in the line of duty and was proceeding to get aboard one of the defendant's trains, and that the injury was sustained at Cochran, Virginia, through the defendant's negligence in permitting a part of its right of way at that place to get and remain in a dangerous condition. Of course, the right of action could not arise under the laws of North Carolina when the causal negligence and the injury occurred in Virginia; and the absence of any mention of the laws of the latter state was at least consistent with their inapplicability. Besides, the allegation that the defendant was operating a railroad in states other than Virginia was superfluous if the right of action arose under the laws of that state, and was pertinent only if it arose in interstate commerce, and therefore under the act of Congress. In these circumstances, while the question is not free from difficulty, we cannot say that the court erred in treating the original complaint as pointing, although only imperfectly, to a cause of action under the law of Congress. And this being so, it must be taken that the amendment merely expanded or amplified what was alleged in support of that cause of action, and related back to the commencement of the suit, which was before the limitation had expired.\n Error is assigned upon a refusal to instruct the jury, as matter of law, that there was no evidence of actionable negligence on the part of the defendant, and that the evidence conclusively established an assumption by the plaintiff of the risk resulting in his injury. Both courts, trial and appellate, held against the defendant upon these \n\n[241 U.S. 290, 295]\n\u00a0\n points. They involve an appreciation of all the evidence and the inferences which admissibly might be drawn therefrom; and it suffices to say that we find no such clear or certain error as would justify disturbing the concurring conclusions of the two courts upon these questions.

The criticism is directed against mere fragments of this part of the charge, and the objections made at the time were not such as were calculated to draw the trial court's attention to the particular complaint now urged. The inaccuracies were not grave and the charge as a whole was calculated to give the jury a fair understanding of the subject. The defendant, therefore, is not in a position to press the complaint, especially as it was not dealt with in the opinion of the appellate court. See Magniac v.

VILLAGE OF SOUTH ORANGE(1916)\nNo. 74\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 100, 101]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William J. Kearns for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Adrian Riker for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error to the supreme court of New Jersey, seeking to reverse a judgment of that court, which judgment was affirmed by the court of errors and appeals of New Jersey (86 N. J. L. 365, 90 Atl. 1126), and the record remitted to the supreme court. The case involves the validity of a tax levied by the assessor of the village of South Orange, for the year 1911, the contention being that the act of the legislature of New Jersey of March 16th, 1870, hereinafter referred to, constituted a contract which could not be repealed by subsequent legislation without doing violence to the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n The case was heard by the Board of Equalization of Taxes of New Jersey, and by the supreme court of that state, upon a stipulation of facts:\n'(1) Seton Hall College was incorporated under an act of the legislature of the state of New Jersey entitled, 'An Act to Incorporate Seton Hall College,' chapter 86 of the Laws of 1861, pages 198 and 199, approved March 8th, 1861\n\n\n\n'(2) A supplement to said act was passed, being chapter 267 of the Laws of 1870, entitled, 'Supplement to an Act to Incorporate Seton Hall College,' approved March 8th, 1861, which supplement was approved March 16th, 1870.\n\n'(3) The act incorporating Drew Theological Semi- \n\n[242 U.S. 100, 102]\n\u00a0\n nary of the Methodist Episcopal Church, referred to in the supplement above mentioned, was approved February 12th, 1868 (Laws of 1968, chap. 2, p. 4).\n\n'(4) That Seton Hall College accepted its charter contained in the Laws of 1861 aforesaid, and thereafter purchased real and personal property from time to time, erected college buildings thereon, and continuously since has been and still is actively engaged in carrying out the purposes of its creation and fulfilling its obligations imposed by its said charter, and has been and is exercising all the powers granted by said charter.\n\n'(5) After the supplement to its charter was passed in 1870, Seton Hall College accepted the same, and purchased further lands and erected further buildings, and has continued ever since to live up to the terms of both acts and carry out the purposes of its creation, and has been and is exercising all the powers granted thereby.\n\n'(6) That the lands in question, with other lands, were acquired by the college by a conveyance dated the 17th day of October, 1864, and recorded in the office of the register of the county of Essex on the 21st day of February, 1865, in book M-12 of deeds for said county, on page 343.\n\n'(7) That no assessment or tax has been levied or imposed upon the property, real and personal, of Seton Hall College from the date of its original charter in 1861, down to the year 1911; and the tax in question, imposed in the year 1911, is the first tax imposed or attempted to be imposed upon the property of said Seton Hall College, real or personal.'\n\n From the act of 1861, under which Seton Hall College was incorporated, it appears that the object of the incorporation is the advancement of education, and that the corporation was given the right to have and possess the authority to confer academic and other degrees granted \n\n[242 U.S. 100, 103]\n\u00a0\n by other colleges in the state. The act of 1870, referred to in the stipulation, extended to Seton Hall College the privileges which were granted to Drew Theological Seminary, in relation to the exemption of real and personal property of the corporation from assessment and taxation. The act incorporating the Drew Theological Seminary provided that the property of the corporation, real and personal, should be exempt from assessment and taxation. In 1875 the Constitution of New Jersey was amended so as to provide that property should be assessed for taxation under general laws and uniform rules, according to its true value. In 1903, the legislature passed a taxation law (4 N. J. Comp. Stat. 5079), which provided that all property not therein expressly exempted should be subject to taxation, and that all acts, general and special, inconsistent with its provisions, were repealed.\n It appears that the lands so assessed are not those upon which the college buildings are erected, but are used for pasture lands for cows and the dwellings of the help on the farm, and that the same are essential and necessary to the use of the college, and that the college derives no pecuniary profit from the lands in question.\n Upon the hearing before the Board of Equalization, the president of that body delivered an opinion, in which it was held that the act relied upon did not purport an intention to impose upon the state an irrepealable contract obligation, but was a privilege extended to the corporation by the state, and therefore subject to revocation. This opinion was adopted and affirmed by the supreme court of New Jersey, and also by the court of errors and appeals.\n This court has the right to determine for itself whether there is a contract which has been impaired by subsequent legislation of the state. This principle has often been recognized and stated in decisions of this court. While this is true, the decision of the state court, con- \n\n[242 U.S. 100, 104]\n\u00a0\n struing its own statutes, is entitled to much consideration and respect. Milwaukee Electric R. & Light Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n238 \nU.S. 174, 182\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1254, 1260, P.U.R.1915D, 591, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 820; New York ex rel. Interborough Rapid Transit Co. v. Sohmer, \n237 \nU.S. 276, 284\n, 59 S. L. ed. 951, 954, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 549.\n In this case, the stipulation of facts shows that Seton Hall College was incorporated under an act of the legislature, and entered upon the discharge of its charter obligations without reliance upon any legislative authority exempting it from taxation upon its property. When the subsequent legislation was enacted,-nine years after,-extending to Seton Hall College the same exemption as was given to the Drew Theological Seminary, it entered upon no new undertaking, and made no agreement by which it promised to do something; nor did it part with anything because of the immunity thus extended to it by the state.\n It is true that this court has held that a charter contract, express in its character, may arise from the acceptance of and action under the terms of a charter which grants such exemption. In this connection, much reliance is placed by the plaintiff in error upon certain rulings of this court; among others, in Home of the Friendless v. Rouse, 8 Wall. 430, 19 L. ed. 495. In that case the corporation is shown to have entered upon its duties and expended its money in reliance upon the grant of the charter, which declared that the property of the corporation should be exempt from taxation, and that that grant was made for the purpose of encouraging such undertaking and enabling the parties engaged therein more fully and effectually to accomplish their purpose; and it was, moreover, provided that the sections of the act concerning corporations, which provided that the charter of every corporation should be subject to alteration, suspension, and repeal at the discretion of the legislature, should not apply to the act creating the Home of the Friendless. This court held that the corporation was thus expressly withdrawn from \n\n[242 U.S. 100, 105]\n\u00a0\n the authority of the general act of the legislature giving a right to alter, suspend, and repeal, and that, under such circumstances, the acceptance of the charter, and the action under it and in reliance upon its terms, constituted an express contract.\n So, in Northwestern University v. Illinois, \n99 U.S. 309\n, 25 L. ed. 387, the act of the legislature declared that the property of the Northwestern University should be forever free from taxation, and this court, differing from the supreme court of Illinois in that respect, held that the exemption applied, in view of the language used in the statute, not only to lots and lands directly used for the purposes of the institution as a school, but also to other lots, lands, and property, the annual profits of which were applied to school purposes, and that the exempting authority of the legislature was not limited to real estate occupied, or in immediate use, by the university.\n Furthermore, when the alleged contract exempting Seton Hall College from taxation was made, the New Jersey act of 1846 was in force, providing that\n'The charter of every corporation which shall hereafter be granted by the legislature shall be subject to alteration, suspension, and repeal in the discretion of the legislature.'\n\n It is true that this act of the legislature was held by this court, in the case of New Jersey v. Yard, \n95 U.S. 104\n, 24 L. ed. 352, not to apply to a case where it appeared, from a subsequent act of the legislature, that a contract was made by requiring of the benefited company the performance of certain acts and a formal acceptance within sixty days, otherwise the act to become wholly inoperative. In that case, the company was obligated, in consideration of the tax limitation stated in the act, to commence and do certain work within a year; in consideration whereof the tax was fixed at the rate of 1\/2 of 1 per cent. This, said this court, had been a subject of disagreement, which \n\n[242 U.S. 100, 106]\n\u00a0\n was adjusted, additional rights were granted, and the tax fixed as to its rate and time of commencement, and, in view of these circumstances, it did appear that it was the legislative intention to make such contract in the same manner and on the same terms of equal obligation as other contracts are made, and not to pass a statute which it could repeal under another act of the legislature. But here there being no such express obligation shown, it is only reasonable to assume that the legislature extended the immunity from taxation to Seton Hall College subject to the right of alteration and repeal reserved in the act of 1846.\n To all claims of contract exemption from taxation must be applied the well-settled rule that, as the power to tax is an exercise of the sovereign authority of the state, essential to its existence, the fact of its surrender in favor of a corporation or an individual must be shown in language which cannot be otherwise reasonably construed, and all doubts which arise as to the intent to make such contract are to be resolved in favor of the state.

Rep. 240.\n Applying these principles, we are unable to conclude that the state court was wrong in finding no binding contract here. As we have said, the college was incorporated under no promise of such exemption, and could not have relied upon it in undertaking the work for which it was organized. After the privilege of the act in favor of the Drew Seminary was extended to it, it made no new promises and assumed no new burdens. It is true it has been kept in operation, and has doubtless continued and expanded its usefulness, but we fail to discover from any- \n\n[242 U.S. 100, 107]\n\u00a0\n thing in this record that it would not have done so except in reliance upon the tax exemption extended to it by the legislature. By the terms of that act, the state court has held a revocable privilege was extended, and no irrepealable contract was entered into. Bearing in mind our own right of independent examination of questions of this character, we are unable to say that the conclusion reached is not well founded in law and in fact.\n It follows that the judgment of the state court must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","171":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSEVEN CASES v.

The articles had been shipped in interstate commerce, from Chicago to Omaha, and remained at the latter place unsold and in the unbroken original packages. The two causes present the same questions, the libels being identical save with respect to quantities and the persons in possession. In each case demurrers were filed by the shipper, the Eckman Manufacturing Company, which challenged both the sufficiency of the libels under the applicable provision of the statute and the constitutionality of that provision. \n\n[239 U.S. 510, 513]\n\u00a0\n The demurrers were overruled, and, the Eckman Company having elected to stand on the demurrers, judgments of condemnation were entered.\n Section 8 of the food and drugs act, as amended by the act of August 23, 1912, chap. 352, 37 Stat. at L. 416, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8724, provides, with respect to the misbranding of drugs, as follows:\n'Sec. 8. That the term 'misbranded,' as used herein, shall apply to all drugs or articles of food or articles which enter into the composition of food, the package or label of which shall bear any statement, design, or device regarding such article, or the ingredients or substances contained therein which shall be false or misleading in any particular, and to any food or drug product which is falsely branded as to the state, territory, or country in which it is manufactured or produced.\n\n'That for the purposes of this act an article shall also be deemed to be misbranded. In case of drugs:\n\n ... * *\n'Third. If its package or label shall bear or contain any statement, design, or device regarding the curative or therapeutic effect of such article or any of the ingredients or substances contained therein, which is false and fraudulent.'\n\n The amendment of 1912 consisted in the addition of paragraph 'Third,' which is the provision here involved.\n It is alleged in each libel that every one of the cases of drugs sought to be condemned contained twelve bottles, each of which was labeled as follows:\n'Eckman's Alterative,-contains twelve per cent of alcohol by weight, or fourteen per cent by volume-used as a solvent. For all throat and lung diseases including Bronchitis, Bronchial Catarrh, Asthma, Hay Fever, Coughs and Colds, and Catarrh of the Stomach and Bowels, and Tuberculosis ( Consumption) . . . Two dollars a bottle. Prepared only by Eckman Mfg. Co. Laboratory Philadelphia, Penna., U. S. A.' \n\n[239 U.S. 510, 514]\n\u00a0\n And in every package, containing one of the bottles, there was contained a circular with this statement:\n\n'Effective as a preventative for Pneumonia.' 'We know it has cured and that it has and will cure Tuberculosis.'\n\n The libel charges that the statement 'effective as a preventative for pneumonia' is 'false, fraudulent, and misleading in this, to wit, that it conveys the impression to purchasers that said article of drugs can be used as an effective preventative for pneumonia, whereas, in truth and in fact, said article of drugs could not be so used;' and that the statement, 'we know it has cured' and that it 'will cure tuberculosis' is 'false, fraudulent, and misleading in this, to wit, that it conveys the impression to purchasers that said article of drugs will cure tuberculosis, or consumption, whereas, in truth and in fact, said article of drugs would not cure tuberculosis, or consumption, there being no medicinal substance nor mixture of substances known at present which can be relied upon for the effective treatment or cure of tuberculosis, or consumption.'\n The principal question presented on this writ of error is with respect to the validity of the amendment of 1912\n\n\n So far as it is objected that this measure, though relating to articles transported in interstate commerce, is an encroachment upon the reserved powers of the states, the objection is not to be distinguished in substance from that which was overruled in sustaining the white slave act, 36 Stat. at L. 825, chap. 395, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8812. Hoke v. United States, \n227 U.S. 308\n, 57 L. ed. 523, 43 L.R.A.(N.S.) 906, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 281, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 905. There, after stating that 'if the facility of interstate transportation' can be denied in the case of lotteries, obscene literature, diseased cattle and persons, and impure food and drugs, the like facility could be taken away from 'the systematic enticement of and the enslavement in prostitution and debauchery of women,' the court concluded with the reassertion of \n\n[239 U.S. 510, 515]\n\u00a0\n the simple principle that Congress is not to be denied the exercise of its constitutional authority over interstate commerce, and its power to adopt not only means necessary but convenient to its exercise, because these means may have the quality of police regulations. Id. pp. 322, 323. See Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 \nU.S. 196, 215\n, 29 S. L. ed. 158, 166, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 382, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826; Hipolite Egg Co. v.

Rep. 561.\n It is urged that the amendment of 1912 does not embrace circulars contained in the package, but only applies to those statements which appear on the package or on the bottles themselves; that is, it is said that the word 'contain' in the amendment must have the same meaning in the case of both 'package' and 'label.' Reference is made to the original provision in the first sentence of  8 with respect to the statements, etc ., which the package or label shall 'bear.' And it is insisted that if the amendment of 1912 covers statements in circulars which are contained in the package, it is unconstitutional. Such statements, it is said, are not so related to the commodity as to form part of the commerce which is within the regulating power of Congress.\n But it appears from the legislative history of the act that the word 'contain' was inserted in the amendment to hit precisely the case of circulars or printed matter placed inside the package, and we think that is due fair import of the provision. Cong. Rec. 62d Cong. 2d Sess. vol. 48, part 11, page 11,322. And the power of Congress manifestly does not depend upon the mere location of the statement accompanying the article, that is, upon the question whether the statement is on or in the package which is transported in interstate commerce. The further contention that Congress may not deal with the package thus transported in the sense of the immediate container of the article as it is intended for consumption is met by McDermott v. Wisconsin, \n228 U.S. 115\n, 57 L. ed. 754, 47 L.R.A.(N.S .) 984, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 39. There the \n\n[239 U.S. 510, 516]\n\u00a0\n court said: 'That the word 'package' or its equivalent expression, as used by Congress in  7 and 8 in defining what shall constitute adulteration and what shall constitute misbranding within the meaning of the act [food and drugs act] clearly refers to the immediate container of the article which is intended for consumption by the public, there can be no question . . . . Limiting the requirements of the act as to adulteration and misbranding simply to the outside wrapping or box containing the packages intended to be purchased by the consumer, so that the importer, by removing and destroying such covering, could prevent the operation of the law on the imported article yet unsold, would render the act nugatory and its provisions wholly inadequate to accomplish the purposes for which it was passed.' And, after stating that the requirements of the act, thus construed, were clearly within the power of Congress over the facilities of interstate commerce, the court added that the doctrine of original packages set forth in repeated decisions, which protected the importer in the right to sell the imported goods, was not 'intended to limit the right of Congress, now asserted, to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from the carriage of injurious or fraudulently branded articles, and to choose appropriate means to that end.' Id. pp. 130, 131, 137.\n Referring to the nature of the statements which are within the purview of the amendment, it is said that a distinction should be taken between articles that are illicit, immoral, or harmful and those which are legitimate, and that the amendment goes beyond statements dealing with identity or ingredients. But the question remains as to what may be regarded as 'illicit,' and we find no ground for saying that Congress may not condemn the interstate transportation of swindling preparations designed to cheat credulous sufferers, and make such preparations, accompanied by false and fraudulent statements, \n\n[239 U.S. 510, 517]\n\u00a0\n illicit with respect to interstate commerce, as well as, for example, lottery tickets. The fact that the amendment is not limited, as was the original statute, to statements regarding identity or composition (United States v. Johnson, \n221 U.S. 488\n, 55 L. ed. 823, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 627), does not mark a constitutional distinction. The false and fraudulent statement which the amendment describes accompanies the article in the package, and thus gives to the article its character in interstate commerce.\n Finally, the statute is attacked upon the ground that it enters the domain of speculation (American School v. McAnnulty, \n187 U.S. 94\n, 47 L. ed. 90, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 33), and by virtue of consequent uncertainty operates as a deprivation of liberty and property without due process of law, in violation of the 5th Amendment of the Constitution, and does not permit of the laying of a definite charge as required by the 6th Amendment. We think that this objection proceeds upon a misconstruction of the provision. Congress deliberately excluded the field where there are honest differences of opinion between schools and of opinion between schools and practitioners. Cong. Rec. 62d Cong. 2d Sess. vol. 48, part 12, Appx. p. 675. It point that the words 'false and fraudulent' were used. This phrase must be taken with its accepted legal meaning, and thus it must be found that the statement contained in the package was put there to accompany the goods with actual intent to deceive,-an intent which may be derived from the facts and circumstances, but which must be established. Id. 676. That false and fraudulent representations may be made with respect to the curative effect of substances is obvious. It is said that the owner has the right to give his views regarding the effect of his drugs. But state of mind is itself a fact, and may be a material fact, and false and fraudulent representations may be made about it; and persons who make or deal in substances or compositions \n\n[239 U.S. 510, 518]\n\u00a0\n alleged to be curative are in a position to have superior knowledge, and may be held to good faith in their statements. Russell v. Clark, 7 Cranch, 69, 92, 3 L. ed. 271, 279; Durland v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 306, 313\n, 40 S. L. ed. 709, 711, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 508; Stebbins v. Eddy, 4 Mason, 414, 423, Fed. Cas.

It cannot be said, for example, that one who should put inert matter or a worthless composition in the channels of trade, labeled or described in an accompanying circular as a cure for disease, when he knows it is not, is beyond the reach of the lawmaking power. Congress recognized that there was a wide field in which assertions as to curative effect are in no sense honest expressions of opinion, but constitute absolute falsehoods, and in the nature of the case can be deemed to have been made only with fraudulent purpose. The amendment of 1912 applies to this field and we have no doubt of its validity.\n With respect to the sufficiency of the averments of the libels, it is enough to say that these averments should receive a sensible construction. There must be a definite charge of the statutory offense, but we are not at liberty to indulge in hypercriticism in order to escape the plain import of the words used. There is no question as to the adequacy of the description of the article, or of the shipments, or of the packages. It is said that there was no proper statement of the contents of the circular. But the libels give the words of the circular, and we think that the allegations were sufficient to show the manner in which they were used. The objection that it was not alleged that the statements in question appeared on the original packages or on the bottles themselves, as already pointed \n\n[239 U.S. 510, 519]\n\u00a0\n out, is based on a misconstruction of the statutory provision. The remaining and most important criticism is that the libels did not sufficiently show that the statements were false and fraudulent. But it was alleged that they were false and fraudulent, and with respect to tuberculosis it was averred that the statement was that the article 'has cured' and 'will cure,' whereas 'in truth and in fact' it would 'not cure,' and that there was no 'medicinal substance nor mixture of substances known at present' which could be relied upon to effect a cure. We think that this was enough to apprise those interested in the goods of the charge which they must meet. It was, in substance, a charge that, contrary to the statute, the article had been made the subject of interstate transportation with a statement contained in the package that the article had cured and would cure tuberculosis, and that this statement was contrary to the fact, and was made with actual intent to deceive.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\n\n\n","172":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSIM v. EDENBORN(1916)\n\nArgued: May 5, 1915Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 131, 132]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Theron G. Strong for petitioner.\n Messrs. Joseph W. Bailey, Martin W. Littleton, and Owen N. Brown for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n By an action at law commenced in the supreme court, Kings county, New York, and subsequently removed to the United States circuit court because of diverse citizenship, petitioner, Sim, sought to recover from respondent the amounts paid upon subscriptions to a syndicate agreement which the latter fraudulently induced him and his assignors to make. By stipulation, a jury being waived, the issues were referred to a referee. The reported facts, essential to an understanding of points now involved, are summarized below. \n\n[242 U.S. 131, 133]\n\u00a0\n While owning the majority stock of United States Iron Company, respondent and others conceived a scheme to consolidate it with certain coal properties, erect blast furnaces, engage in smelting and manufacturing iron, etc. He accordingly prepared an agreement, dated April 15, 1902, stating generally the ends in view, and invited subscriptions. This instrument designated him and two others as 'syndicate managers,' and recited there was an opportunity to acquire for cash the $1,000,000 capital stock of that company, together with valuable coal properties, and that the purpose was to raise the essential two and a half million dollars. It further specified that 'the syndicate managers hereunder shall have the direction and management of the subject-matter of the said syndicate, and each subscriber nominates and appoints the syndicate managers his agents and attorneys irrevocable, until the termination of this agreement, to exercise all the rights of the subscribers in and to the properties proposed to be acquired.' Still other provisions conferred upon the managers wide discretion and powers of control. Petitioner and his assignors became subscribers while in entire ignorance of respondent's true position. He represented that it was proposed to purchase only valuable and paying properties; that subscriptions were payable in dollars, and not in property; that he had made a subscription for $500,000, payable in dollars; that the enterprise was being organized in good faith; that all, according to their interest, had equal rights and stood on same basis; that every man's dollar was put up against every other man's dollar; and that there were to be no special advantages to anyone. In fact, however, he always intended to utilize stock owned by him in payment of his subscription. The managers changed the company's name to Sheffield Coal & Iron Company, increased the capital to $2,500,000, and caused it to acquire additional coal properties. For cash paid to them \n\n[242 U.S. 131, 134]\n\u00a0\n by syndicate members, they delivered an equal amount of stock issued by the corporation. In settlement of his subscription (reduced from $500,000 to $475,000) respondent surrendered the majority stock in United States Iron Company, at a valuation of $70 per share, paid balance in cash, and took new certificates. When he solicited and obtained subscriptions and received payments, he knew subscribers were relying upon him faithfully to act as their agent. Subsequent to the specified transactions petitioner and his assignors discovered respondent's interest, and thereupon promptly elected to rescind their subscriptions, gave due notice to the managers, offered to return and restore all stock received, and demanded their money.\n Relying on Heckscher v. Edenborn, 203 N. Y. 210, 96 N. E. 441, the referee reported that Edenborn was liable for amounts paid, with interest, and final judgment therefor was duly entered. The circuit court of appeals declined to follow the state court, and, being of opinion that 'it is a condition of rescission that the status quo shall be restored,' and that no such restoration had been offered, reversed the trial court (124 C. C. A. 339, 206 Fed. 275, 277). The cause is here upon writ of certiorari.\n Heckscher v. Edenborn arose out of another subscription to the agreement now involved, and the essential facts there and here are substantially alike. After much consideration the court of appeals decided in favor of plaintiff, Heckscher, holding the agreement was vitiated by fraud because Edenborn failed to reveal his interest in the stock intended to be purchased, and, further, that tender of stock actually received was all the subscriber could do towards restoring the original position, and constituted an adequate preliminary to an action for recovery. The opinion expresses that court's deliberate conclusion upon the issues, and is supported by reference to earlier decisions of its own and other authorities. \n\n[242 U.S. 131, 135]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner now contends that the court of appeals was correct upon principle, and, moreover, that if doubts exist they should be resolved in favor of its opinion. On the other hand, respondent maintains the questions involved are of general law, and that the state court reached an unwarranted result, not to be accepted here.\n This court has many times considered how far Federal tribunals, when undertaking to enforce laws of the states, should follow opinions of their courts. The authorities were reviewed and rule announced in Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 U.S. 20\n, 33-35, 27 L. ed. 359, 365, 366, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10, which declared that, as to doctrines of commercial law and general jurisprudence, the former exercise their own judgment, 'but even in such cases, for the sake of harmony and to avoid confusion, the Federal courts will lean towards an agreement of views with the state courts, if the question seems to them balanced with doubt.' This has been often reaffirmed. Wilson v. Standefer, \n184 \nU.S. 399, 412\n, 46 S. L. ed. 612, 618, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 384; Bienville Water Supply Co. v. Mobile, \n186 \nU.S. 212, 220\n, 46 S.

Veazie v. Williams, 8 How. 134, 158, 12 L. ed. 1018, 1028; Andrews v. Hensler, 6 Wall. 254, 258, 18 L. ed. 737, 739; Neblett v. Macfarland, \n92 U.S. 101\n, 103-105, 23 L. ed. 471-473.\n Through misleading representations and suppression of facts, respondent induced syndicate subscribers to become parties to an agreement creating him their agent to acquire and deal with certain properties,-a position \n\n[242 U.S. 131, 136]\n\u00a0\n of especial trust and confidence. His original undisclosed purpose was to obtain their money and appropriate it toward purchase of something partly owned by himself. Having led them to intrust their funds to his discretion, he carried out his preconceived plan, and, as a part of it, caused them to receive an equivalent amount of corporate stock. He now seeks to avoid a judgment, because his own actions have rendered it impossible for him to get back to the beginning point.\n This was not a proceeding in equity addressed to the court's discretion, but a demand at law upon an agent for return of something improperly received and disposed of. The defrauded principals tendered back everything received by them,-did all they could towards restoring original conditions. In such circumstances it is but just and right that any loss should fall on the unfaithful agent, not on his too-confiding principals. See Snow v. Alley, 144 Mass. 546, 551, 59 Am. Rep. 119, 11 N.

Edenborn, the Court of Appeals reached a result well supported both by reason and upon authority, and that the courts below should have followed it when undertaking to determine rights depending upon the laws of New York. The action of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed; and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McKenna, Mr. Justice Day, and Mr. Justice Van Devanter dissent, being of opinion that the questions involved are of general, not local, law; that there has not been such restoration of the status quo as is essential to a recovery at law upon a rescission; and that, upon the facts specially found by the referee, the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right. \n\n\n\n","173":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN EXP CO. v.

C. 542, 81 S. E. 741.\n In defense the Express Company averred: That while engaged in interstate commerce it received the described articles at Asheville and transported them to Hickory Grove; that, as required by act of Congress approved June 29, 1906 [34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563], and amendments, it had filed a schedule of rates with the Interstate Commerce Commission; that at time of shipment it issued a bill of lading limiting liability to $50; that it had paid the shipper the full amount expended by him in purchasing the articles; that no present liability exists, and especially under the laws of the United States it is not responsible for such damages as those specified.\n There was put in evidence a duly executed receipt for $64.17, 'being in full payment for one coffin delivered to Southern Express Company at Asheville, North Carolina, on April 1st, 1912, by John Byers, to be shipped to Sarah Moore, Hickory Grove, South Carolina;' and Byers testified that 'the Southern Express Company paid him for all the money he had paid out on the casket and other things contained in the shipment, but did not pay him anything for damages.' The bill of lading was also introduced. It specified no value and undertook to restrict the carrier's liability to $50. Clause 1 is copied in the margin. \n1\n Objection was sustained to a seasonable \n\n[240 U.S. 612, 614]\n\u00a0\n offer by the company to prove its schedules of rates on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Manifestly the shipment was interstate commerce; and, under the settled doctrine established by our former opinions, rights and liabilities in connection therewith depend upon acts of Congress, the bill of lading and common-law principles accepted and enforced by the Federal courts. In order to determine the validity and effect of restrictions upon liability contained in such bills, it is important, if not indeed essential, to consider the applicable schedules Exp. Co. v.

This instruction should have been given.\n The action is based upon a claim for mental suffering only,-nothing else was set up and the proof discloses no other injury for which compensation had not been made. In such circumstances as those presented here, the long-recognized common-law rule permitted no recovery; the decisions to this effect 'rest upon the elementary principle that mere mental pain and anxiety are too vague for legal redress where no injury is done to person, property, health, or reputation.' Cooley, Torts, 3d ed. page 94. The lower Federal courts, almost without exception, have adhered to this doctrine, and in so doing we think they were clearly right upon principle and also in accord with the great weight of authority.

CO. v. GRAY(1916)\nNo. 355\nArgued: May 5, 1916Decided: May 22, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 333, 334]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. L. E. Jeffries, H. O'B. Cooper, and L. L. Oliver for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Thomas H. Calvert and John A. Barringer for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n Kenneth L. Gray, an experienced brakeman, was of the crew in charge of plaintiff in error's north-bound interstate freight train which started from Spencer at 9:45 P. M. August 29, 1912. Seeking damages for his death, the administratrix brought this suit under the Federal employers' liability act (chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657, chap. 143, 36 Stat. at L. 291) in the superior court, Randolph County, North Carolina. Among other things here amended complaint alleges:\n'5. That on the 30th day of August, 1912, the intestate of the plaintiff was on a freight train running from Spencer in the state of North Carolina to Washington, District of Columbia, through the state of Virginia, and when the freight train upon which the intestate of the plaintiff was operating in going north arrived at Dry Fork, in the state of Virginia, the intestate of the plaintiff was sent forward about three quarters of a mile to signal a passenger train of defendant coming south; that the intestate of the plaintiff, when he had gotten about three quarters of a mile from Dry Fork, for some reason-loss of sleep or for some other \n\n[241 U.S. 333, 335]\n\u00a0\n cause unknown to the plaintiff-laid down by the side of the track of the defendant with his head on the end of the cross-ties and went to sleep; that shortly thereafter passenger train No. 37, coming south as aforesaid, carelessly and negligently ran over the intestate. . . .\n\n ... * *\n'7. That the death of the intestate of the plaintiff was caused without fault on his part and by the wrongful and negligent act of the defendant, in that both the engineer and the fireman upon the passenger train which killed the intestate of the plaintiff could have easily seen the intestate of the plaintiff lying in a helpless condition as aforesaid upon the track of the defendant, the track of the defendant being straight a sufficient distance upon which the said passenger train was running toward the intestate of the plaintiff to have stopped the train or slackened its speed sufficiently to have prevented the killing of the intestate of the plaintiff, ran their train onto the intestate of the plaintiff without ringing the bell, without blowing its whistle, without slackening its speed, or without stopping the said train; in that the servants of the defendant did not keep proper lookout on the track in front of the engine, and have the engine and train of the defendant in proper control so that they could stop the engine of the defendant in time to have prevented the wrongful killing of the intestate of the plaintiff; in that the servants of the defendant did not see the intestate of the plaintiff, which it was their duty to do and which they could have done by ordinary care, until the train was so near the prostrate form of the intestate of the plaintiff that the servants of the defendant could not stop the train in time to save the life of the intestate of the plaintiff; in that the servants of the defendant wrongfully killed the intestate of the plaintiff upon the said occasion when they had the last clear chance to save his life, which they failed to do by the exercise of ordinary care.' \n\n[241 U.S. 333, 336]\n\u00a0\n The accident occurred at 5:14 A. M.,-twenty minutes before sunrise,- when it was somewhat foggy and ordinary objects on the ground could not readily be seen without artificial light. Approaching Dry Fork station the freight train stalled, and having been divided into two sections, these were hauled onto sidings there. After placing section 1, and as returned by the main track to bring up section 2, the freight engineer directed Gray to flag south-bound passenger train No. 37. It was the latter's duty, with a red and white lantern in hand, to go forward eighteen telegraph poles (half a mile) and lay a torpedo on the track; then to go nine poles further and place two torpedoes; then to return, stand near pole eighteen and await the expected train. No torpedo was put in place; but having advanced some three quarters of a mile he set the lanterns on the track, lay down with his head on a cross-tie, and went to sleep. There is nothing to explain this action.\n\n From Banister Hill, 2 1\/4 miles southward, and almost to Dry Fork, the track, following several curves, descends on a heavy grade. Commencing say 3\/4 of a mile down this grade it runs in a straight line 1\/8 mile; then around a sharp curve to the right, passing through a deep cut, to a point some 600 feet from where the brakeman lay; then again in a straight line some 400 feet; and thence around a moderate curve to the left perhaps a half mile.\n On the west side of this last curve, approximately 217 feet from its north end, is the spot where Gray slept. Coming south along the track in broad daylight one can first see it when he reaches a point on the right- hand curve in the deep cut 1,254 feet away.\n Passenger train No. 37, properly equipped, 790 feet long, composed of ten cars,-six steel sleepers and four other cars,-a tender and engine, came down the long grade running 55 miles an hour. The engineer says \n\n[241 U.S. 333, 337]\n\u00a0\n that, approaching the right-hand curve, he blew a station signal; when he reached point in the cut where it first became possible to see the lights, he blew a flagman's signal; almost immediately thereafter, seeing the body, he put on brakes, turned off steam, and did everything possible to check the train; before this could be done, a low step struck the brakeman's head. Just before No. 37 blew for that station (it was not scheduled to stop there) the freight engine, standing at Dry Fork, signaled for Gray's return.\n Three engineers testified that, in the circumstances, the pasenger train could not have been stopped in less than 1,900 feet, and no other evidence was offered on this point. There is nothing indicating that after the engineer saw or could have seen the brakeman's body the train could have been stopped before reaching it.\n In an effort to discredit the passenger engineer, only witness to some circumstances, he was asked on cross-examination concerning prior contradictory statements; but the exclusion of all or any part of his evidence would not change the result. Of course, the contradictory statements can have no legal tendency to establish the truth of their subject-matter. Donaldson v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. 188 Mass. 484, 486, 74 N. E. 915; McDonald v. New York C. & H. R. R. Co. 186 Mass. 474, 72 N. E. 55; Com. v. Starkweather, 10 Cush. 59; Sloan v. New York C. R. Co. 45 N. Y. 125; Purdy v. People, 140 Ill. 46, 29 N. E. 700.\n Following local practice, at close of all the evidence a motion was made to dismiss as of nonsuit, because negligence by the railroad had not been shown. The court denied this and submitted two issues to the jury,- 'whether the intestate of the plaintiff was killed by the negligence of the defendant, as alleged in the complaint,' and 'what damage, if any, is the plaintiff entitled to recover.' In connection with these a lengthy and rather involved charge was given, the objections to which it is not now necessary for us to consider. Judgment upon a \n\n[241 U.S. 333, 338]\n\u00a0\n verdict for the administratrix was affirmed by the supreme court. 167 N. C. 433, 83 S. E. 849.\n Plaintiff in error maintains that the trial court erred in overruling its motion to dismiss, and also relies upon objections to the charge. Counsel for defendant in error claim all instructions were correct, and insist that the verdict is adequately supported by evidence. Concerning the latter they say:\n'On the testimony and the law applicable to the case the jury could have arrived at the following conclusions:\n\n'1. That there was an unobstructed view of more than 1,200 feet from the danger signals and the place the intestate was struck.\n\n'2. That the red and white lights were on the track. This was undisputed.\n\n'3. That it was the duty of the engineer to keep a lookout for danger signals. . . .\n\n'4. That the fact the train approached about 1,300 feet distant around a curve did not excuse the engineer from keeping a lookout down the track.\n\n'5. That the lights on the track could in fact be more easily seen when they were in the darkness and out of the direct rays of the headlight as the train was entering the straight track from the curve.\n\n'6. That in the exercise of ordinary care the engineer could have seen the lights at a point more than 1,200 feet distant.\n\n'7. That the engineer should have blown his signal as soon as he saw the danger signals, or by the exercise of ordinary care could have seen them, which was when he was more than 1,200 feet distant.\n\n'8. That instead of bringing his train under control and trying to stop it as soon as he saw, or, by the exercise of ordinary care, could have seen, the lights, the engineer waited until he saw the intestate lying beside the track.'\n\n As the action is under the Federal employers' liability \n\n[241 U.S. 333, 339]\n\u00a0\n act, rights and obligations depend upon it, and applicable principles of common law as interpreted and applied in Federal courts. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, \n233 U.S. 492\n, 58 L. ed. 1062, L.R.A.1915C, 1, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475, 8 N. C. C. A. 834; Central Vermont R. Co. v.

Rep. 406.\n Negligence by the railway company is essential to a recovery; and there is not a scintilla of evidence to show this under the most favorable view of the testimony urged by counsel for defendant in error. When it first became possible for the engineer to see signal lights 1,254 feet away he had a right to suppose the brakeman was standing there on guard. Immediately, he says, the customary signal was sounded. No duty to the brakeman demanded an instant effort to stop the train,-the indicated danger was more than half a mile away. Moreover, application of emergency apparatus on that moment, it appears, would not have caused a stop in time to prevent the accident. There is no evidence that the engineer could have seen the brakeman a single moment before he did, or omitted thereafter to do all within his power.\n We think the motion to dismiss should have been granted. The judgment below is accordingly reversed and the cause remanded to the Supreme Court of North Carolina for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","175":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN R. CO. v. LLOYD(1916)\nNo. 296\nArgued: November 29, 1915Decided: January 10, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. John M. Wilson, L. E. Jeffries, and H. O'B. Cooper for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Aubrey L. Brooks for defendant in error. \n\n[239 U.S. 496, 497]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n W. L. Lloyd, herein called the plaintiff, brought his action in the superior court of Guilford county, North Carolina, against the defendant, the Southern Railway Company, joined with its lessor, the North Carolina Railroad Company. The action was brought under the Federal employers' liability act of 1908, 35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, as amended April 5th, 1910, 36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8662\n\n\n The North Carolina Railroad Company is a corporation of the state of North Carolina, owning a railroad line extending from Goldsboro, North Carolina, to Charlotte, in the same state. The Southern Railway Company is organized under the laws of the state of Virginia, and is a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce, transporting freight and passengers from the city of Washington, District of Columbia, through Greensboro, and over the tracks of the North Carolina Railroad Company through Spencer, Salisbury, and Charlotte.\n The petition charges that the Southern Railway Company was, at the time of the injuries complained of, operating as lessee of the North Carolina Railroad Company the roads and side tracks at Spencer; that on January 12th, 1911, plaintiff was employed as an engineer by the defendant, Southern Railway Company, upon its freight trains running over said line of road from Spencer, North Carolina, to Monroe, Virginia, and was engaged in interstate traffic; that upon said date he was directed as engineer to take charge of a certain engine at Spencer, to ascertain whether the same was in serviceable condition, as it had just come from the repair shops; that while he was operating the engine on one of the side tracks of the North Carolina Railroad Company's main line at Spencer, and was oiling and inspecting the same, in stooping over the engine to ascertain if the ash pan and other equipments were in proper condition, a lever about 2 \n\n[239 U.S. 496, 498]\n\u00a0\n feet long, located at the rear of the driving wheel and the lower side of the engine, used for the purpose of operating the damper to the ash pan, tripped and violently struck the plaintiff in the forehead, causing serious harm and injury; that the defective condition was known to the Southern Railway Company, and unknown to the plaintiff; that the plaintiff, at the time of the injury, was employed by the Southern Railway Company for the purpose of transporting interstate commerce running to and from Spencer, North Carolina, along the main line of the Southern Railway Company, part of which said line included the portion of said North Carolina Railroad Company's line leased by the Southern Railway Company from Greensboro, North Carolina, to Spencer, North Carolina; that the engine upon which the plaintiff was hurt was, and had been, exclusively used by the Southern Railway Company in the transportation of interstate commerce over the line of said road between Spencer and Monroe, Virginia, and that the plaintiff, at the time of his injury, was in charge of said engine. Negligence of the Southern Railway Company is charged in furnishing the plaintiff with an unsafe and dangerous engine, knowing the same to be such, and thereby rendering the plaintiff's employment hazardous and dangerous, and unnecessarily exposing him to peril.\n The Southern Railway Company in due season filed its petition for removal of the case to the district court of the United States for the western district of North Carolina, because of its diversity of citizenship with the plaintiff, and alleging that the joinder of the North Carolina Railroad Company, the local defendant, was fraudulently made to avoid Federal jurisdiction; that the plaintiff was not engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the accident; that the engine upon which he was injured was not engaged in any kind of commerce at the time of the accident; and that these allegations in the petition were \n\n[239 U.S. 496, 499]\n\u00a0\n fraudulent and false, which the plaintiff knew, or could have ascertained by the exercise of the slightest diligence upon his part. The court refused to remove the case, to which refusal the Southern Railway Company excepted.\n Upon issue joined, the case came on for trial at the February term, 1913, of the superior court of Guilford county. At the close of plaintiff's testimony, the court intimated that there was no cause of action against the North Carolina Railroad Company; upon this intimation a nonsuit was taken as to that company. Thereupon the Southern Railway Company filed a second petition for removal which the court, after argument, granted, and an order was made, removing the case to the district court of the United States for the western district of North Carolina. The plaintiff excepted to this order of removal, and to the nonsuit as to the North Carolina Railroad Company, and, upon appeal to the supreme court of North Carolina, that court held that the case should not have been removed, and remanded it to the superior court of Guilford county for trial. 162 N. C. 485, 78 S. E. 489.\n The case coming on again for trial in the superior court, the Southern Railway Company renewed its objections to the jurisdiction by a plea, and set up that the case had been docketed in the district court of the United States for the western district of North Carolina, that no motion had been made to remand the same, that the order removing it had not been revoked, and that the case was then pending for trial in the district court as aforesaid. The North Carolina Railroad Company also filed a plea to the jurisdiction. These pleas were overruled, and upon trial a verdict and judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff. Upon appeal to the supreme court of North Carolina, that judgment was affirmed. 166 N. C. 24, 81 S. E. 1003, 7 N. C. C. A. 520.\n From the statement of the case already made, it is apparent that the plaintiff sought to recover under the \n\n[239 U.S. 496, 500]\n\u00a0\n Federal employers' liability act, joining both railroad companies upon the theory that the lessor company remained liable under the law of North Carolina upon the cause of action asserted by the plaintiff. See North Carolina R. Co. v. Zachary, \n232 U.S. 248\n, 58 L. ed. 591, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 159. On the face of the petition a case was made invoking the jurisdiction of the state court to recover under the Federal act, because of the negligence charged. That the state court had jurisdiction of such an action is expressly provided by the Federal statute. Act of April 5, 1910, 36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8662.\n In no case can the right of removal be established by a petition to remove which amounts simply to a traverse of the facts alleged in the plaintiff's petition, and in that way undertaking to try the merits of a cause of action, good upon its face. Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Cockrell, \n232 U.S. 146\n, 58 L. ed. 544, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 278. It is only in cases wherein the facts alleged in the petition for removal are sufficient to fairly raise the issue of fraud that the state court is required to surrender its jurisdiction. The order of nonsuit in the trial court as to the North Carolina Railroad Company, appealed from by plaintiff, with the right of review in the supreme court of the state, did not make the case removable as to the Southern Railway Company. American Car & Foundry Co. v. Kettelhake, \n236 U.S. 311\n, 59 L. ed. 594, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 357. Moreover, as we shall see later, under the employers' liability act, no case is removable merely because of diversity of citizenship.\n The act of 1910, supra, expressly gives jurisdiction to the state court, and provides that no case arising under its provisions, brought in a state court of competent jurisdiction, shall be removed to any court of the United States. Section 28 of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. at L. 1087, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1010, contains a like provision, and expressly provides that no case arising under the employers' liability act or any amendment thereto, brought in a state court of competent jurisdiction, shall be removed to any court of the United States. The question of the effect of this provision upon the right \n\n[239 U.S. 496, 501]\n\u00a0\n to remove a case because of diversity of citizenship, since the passage of the act referred to, was before this court and passed upon in Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Leslie, \n238 U.S. 599\n, 59 L. ed. 1478, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 844. It was therein held that there was no authority to remove such action from the state court to the Federal court because of diversity of citizenship. Nor did the alleged fraudulent joinder of the local defendant in the state court give such right. North Carolina R. Co. v. Zachary, supra. And see Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Whiteaker, decided in this court, December 20, 1915 [\n239 U.S. 421\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 152]. Such right did not arise from the allegation of the removal petition that the injury did not happen in interstate commerce. Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v. Cockrell, supra. It follows that the state court did not err in its judgment as to the right of removal upon the facts presented in this case.\n As to other questions of a Federal character, they may be briefly disposed of. It is insisted that the trial court should have given the instruction requested by the railroad company to the effect that, upon the facts shown, the plaintiff was not engaged in interstate commerce at the time of his injury. Upon this subject there is testimony in the record to support the allegations of plaintiff's petition and the charge to the jury as given. The trial court charged that, in order to recover, the burden was upon the plaintiff to show that at the time he received his injury he was engaged in interstate commerce. In refusing the request asked, and leaving the issue to the jury, the trial court committed no error, and the supreme court of the state rightly affirmed the judgment in that respect. North Carolina R. Co. v. Zachary, supra; Pedersen v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. \n229 U.S. 146\n, 57 L. ed. 1125, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 153, 3 N. C. C. A. 779; New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v. Carr, \n238 U.S. 260\n, 59 L. ed. 1298, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 780; Pennsylvania Co. v. Donat, decided by this court November 1st, 1915 [\n239 U.S. 50\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 4.]\n The court properly refused the request as to contributory negligence and gave the rule laid down in the em- \n\n[239 U.S. 496, 502]\n\u00a0\n ployers' liability act. As to assumption of risk, the supreme court held that no such issue was made or submitted to the trial court (a conclusion fully supported by the record), and therefore under the state practice no question concerning that subject was presented on appeal. This conclusion denied no right of a Federal character.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","176":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN R. CO. v. PRESCOTT(1916)\nNo. 358\nArgued: February 23, 1916Decided: April 10, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 632, 633]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank G. Tompkins and Benjamin L. Abney for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. J. Willard Ragsdale, W. H. Townsend, and J. Wm. Thurmond for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought to recover for the loss of nine boxes of shoes which were destroyed by fire, on July 4, \n\n[240 U.S. 632, 634]\n\u00a0\n 1913, while in the possession of the Southern Railway Company, plaintiff in error. These boxes were part of a lot of thirteen boxes which had been shipped on June 21, 1913, at Petersburg, Virginia, by the Seaboard Air Line Railway and connections, consigned to W. E. Prescott, defendant in error, at Edgefield, South Carolina, and had arrived at Edgefield over the line of the Southern Railway Company on June 23, 1913. The plaintiff alleged three causes of action against the latter company: (1) as common- carrier, (2) as warehouseman, and (3) for penalty because of failure to adjust and pay the claim, after notice, as provided by law. The answer of the railway company, with a general denial, set up that the shipment was interstate and governed by the act to regulate commerce. At the close of the plaintiff's case, the railway company moved for a nonsuit and decision was reserved. The railway company then put in evidence the tariff rules, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, which governed the shipment. These provided that the reduced rates specified would 'apply on property shipped subject to the condition of carrier's bill of lading,' and that otherwise there would be an increased charge, as stated. One of the stipulations of the bill of lading was that 'property not removed by the party entitled to receive it within forty-eight hours (exclusive of legal holidays) after notice of its arrival' might be kept in car, depot, or warehouse, 'subject to reasonable charge for storage and to carrier's responsibility as warehouseman only.' The freight bill contained the provision: 'Demurrage and storage will be assessed at the expiration of the free time provided by the rules of this company.'\n The agent for the railway company (confirming what had been said by the plaintiff's witness) testified that after notice of the arrival of the goods, the consignee had paid the entire freight charges, that he (the company's agent) 'had accepted the freight' and had the consignee's \n\n[240 U.S. 632, 635]\n\u00a0\n 'receipt for the goods.' Four boxes were then taken away, and the rest were permitted to remain to meet the consignee's convenience in removal. The agent further testified: 'Q. What was the agreement with reference to holding those goods? A. He just wanted to know if it would be agreeable to leave them there, and I said it would be. Q. You did not make any charges for storing them? A. No, sir. Q. And did not expect him to pay any? No. sir.' The consignee's representative had testified that, while nothing had been said on the point, he expected to pay storage.\n At the close of the testimony, the plaintiff withdrew his causes of action against the defendant as common carrier and for the penalty, and the case went to the jury solely with respect to the liability of the defendant as warehouseman. The railway company moved for a direction of a verdict upon the ground that, under the Federal act and the tariff regulations, the bill of lading defined the rights of the parties. The motion was denied. The trial court submitted to the jury the question of liability for the care of the goods as one arising under the state law, which cast upon the defendant the burden of showing that it was not negligent. The position of the railway company, as shown by its requests for instructions which were denied, was that the shipment had not lost its interstate character; that the provisions of the bill of lading were controlling; that the defendant's liability as warehouseman was governed by Federal law; and that the burden was upon the plaintiff to show negligence as a basis for recovery.\n Judgment upon a verdict in favor of the plaintiff was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 99 S. C. 422, 83 S. E. 781. With respect to the Federal question, the court said: 'The defendant claims that, inasmuch as this is an interstate shipment, the Federal statute governs. This question does not legitimately arise in this case for the reason \n\n[240 U.S. 632, 636]\n\u00a0\n that the appellant moved for a nonsuit on the ground that 'the evidence here shows that this freight arrived here on the 23d of June and that the freight was paid and receipted for by the agent of Dr. Prescott. He came for it and paid the freight, and I submit that where a common carrier delivered freight in good order, and has it in its depot and paid for, then its liability as a common carrier ceases.' The court reserved its decision on that question and before it was announced, the plaintiff withdrew the cause of action against defendant as common carrier and also the cause of action for the penalty. It therefore being conceded in the circuit court that the contract of carriage was ended, and the appellant held the goods by a separate contract, the question as to appellant's liability as common carrier and the Federal statute under which it might have arisen is not before this court, and the only question argued which we can consider is the question as to warehouseman.' The court then applied the rule of liability as defined by the state law. Id. p. 424. And this writ of error has been prosecuted.\n As the shipment was interstate, and the bill of lading was issued pursuant to the Federal act, the question whether the contract thus set forth had been discharged was necessarily a Federal question. The reference, above quoted, to the concession in the trial court, cannot be taken to mean that this Federal question was not raised, for, as we have seen, it was distinctly presented and pressed; but we assume that the ruling, in substance, was that there was no dispute as to the fact that the goods had arrived, that the consignee had paid the freight and signed a receipt for the goods, and that the nine boxes had remained in the possession of the carrier under the permission given, as testified, by the carrier's agent. The question is whether this admitted transaction had the legal effect of discharging the contract governed by Federal law, and of creating a new obligation governed by state law. \n\n[240 U.S. 632, 637]\n\u00a0\n By the act to regulate commerce ( 1) the 'transportation' it regulates is defined as including 'all services in connection with the receipt, delivery, elevation, and transfer in transit, ventilation, refrigeration or icing, storage, and handling of property transported.' [ 34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563.] It is made the duty of the carrier 'to provide . . . such transportation upon reasonable request therefor.' All charges made for 'any service' rendered in such transportation must be 'just and reasonable.' Section 61 requires that the carrier's schedules, printed as provided, 'shall contain the classification of freight in force, and shall also state separately all terminal charges, storage charges, icing charges, and other charges which the Commission may require, all privileges or facilities granted or allowed and any rules or regulations which in any wise change, affect, or determine any part or the aggregate of such aforesaid rates, fares, and charges, or the value of the service rendered to the passenger, shipper, or consignee.' And it is further provided, in the same section, that no carrier shall 'extend to any shipper or person any privileges or facilities in the transportation'-that is, as defined-'except such as are specified in such tariffs.' The bill of lading in accordance with the published regulations provided that 'every service' to be performed under it, including the service of the connecting or terminal carrier, should be subject to the conditions specified, and among these was the express condition governing the company's responsibility as warehouseman for property not removed within forty-eight hours after notice of arrival. Such a retention of the goods was undoubtedly a terminal service forming a part to the 'transportation' in the sense of the Federal act and governed by that act. Thus, in the case of Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Dettlebach, \n239 U.S. 588\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 177, it was held, with respect to goods lost through the negligence of the terminal carrier while in possession as warehouseman under this stipulation, that the provision \n\n[240 U.S. 632, 638]\n\u00a0\n of the bill of lading limiting liability to the declared value of the goods was applicable. The court deemed it to be evident 'that Congress recognized that the duty of carriers to the public included the performance of a variety of services that, according to the theory of the common law, were separable from the carrier's service as carrier, and, in order to prevent overcharges and discriminations from being made under the pretext of performing such additional services, it enacted that so far as interstate carriers by rail were concerned, the entire body of such services should be included together under the single term 'transportation,' and subjected to the provisions of the act respecting reasonable rates and the like.' It is also clear that, with respect to the service governed by the Federal statute, the parties were not at liberty to alter the terms of the service as fixed by the filed regulations. This has repeatedly been held with respect to rates (Texas & P. R. Co. v. Mugg, \n202 U.S. 242\n, 50 L. ed. 1011, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 628; Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, \n227 \nU.S. 639, 652\n, 57 S. L. ed. 683, 688, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391; Boston & M. R. Co. v. Hooker, \n233 \nU.S. 97, 112\n, 58 S. L. ed. 868, 876, L.R.A. 1915B, 450, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 526, Ann. Cas. 1915D, 593; Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Maxwell, \n237 U.S. 94\n, 59 L. ed. 853, L.R.A. 1915E, 665, P.U.R.1915C, 300, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 494), and the established principle applies equally to any stipulation attempting to alter the provisions as fixed by the published rules relating to any of the services within the purview of the act. Chicago & A. R. Co. v. Kirby, \n225 \nU.S. 155, 166\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1033, 1038, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 501; Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Robinson, \n233 \nU.S. 173, 181\n, 58 S. L. ed. 901, 905, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 556. This is the plain purpose of the statute in order to shut the door to all contrivances in violation of its provisions against preferences and discriminations. No carrier may extend 'any privileges or facilities,' save as these have been duly specified. And as the terminal services incident to an interstate shipment are within the Federal act, and the conditions of liability while the goods are retained after notice of arrival are stipulated in the bill of lading under the filed regulations, the conditions thus fixed are controlling, and the parties cannot substitute therefor a special agreement. \n\n[240 U.S. 632, 639]\n\u00a0\n In determining, in this view, whether the contract had been discharged, and the case removed from the operation of the Federal act, regard must, of course, be had to the substance of the transaction. The question is not one of form, but of actuality. Texas & N. O. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co. \n227 \nU.S. 111, 126\n, 57 S. L. ed. 442, 448, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 239; Railroad Commission v. Texas & P. R. Co. \n229 \nU.S. 336, 341\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1215, 1218, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 837; Illinois C. R. Co. v. De Fuentes, \n236 \nU.S. 157, 163\n, 59 S. L. ed. 517, 519, P.U.R.1915A, 840, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 275; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Clark Bros. Coal Min. Co. \n238 U.S. 456\n, 458 59 L. ed. 1406, 1408, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896. It is apparent that there had been no actual delivery of the nine boxes. The payment of the freight had no greater efficacy than if it had been made in advance of the transportation. The giving of a receipt for the goods by the consignee did not alter the fact that they were still held by the railway company, awaiting actual delivery. The transaction at most could not be deemed to accomplish more than if the parties had agreed that, until such delivery, the goods should be held under a special contract, in lieu of the prescribed conditions, and this they could not effect without violating the cat which governed the shipment. It could not be said, for example, that while under the filed regulations the railway company was to make a 'reasonable charge for storage' pending delivery, that it could agree with a particular shipper, or consignee, to hold gratuitously; nor could it alter the terms of its responsibility while the goods remained undelivered. The actual service in holding the goods continued, and we must look to the bill of lading to determine the legal obligation attaching to that service.\n Viewing the contract set forth in the bill of lading as still in force, the measure of liability under it must also be regarded as a Federal question. As it has often been said, the statutory provisions manifest the intent of Congress that the obligation of the carrier with respect to the services within the purview of the statute shall be governed by uniform rule in the place of the diverse requirements \n\n[240 U.S. 632, 640]\n\u00a0\n of state legislation and decisions.

Peninsular Produce Exch. \n240 U.S. 34\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 230. And the question as to the responsibility under the bill of lading is none the less a Federal one because it must be resolved by the application of general principles of the common law. Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger and Missouri K. & T. R. Co. v. Harriman, supra. It was explicitly provided that in case the property was not removed within the specified time, it should be kept, subject to liability 'as warehouseman only.' The railway company was therefore liable only in case of negligence. The plaintiff, asserting neglect, had the burden of establishing it. This burnden did not shift. As it is the duty of the warehouseman to deliver upon proper demand, his failure to do so, without excuse, has been regarded as making a prima facie case of negligence. If, however, it appears that the loss is due to fire, that fact in itself, in the absence of circumstances permitting the inference of lack of reasonable precautions, does not suffice to show neglect, and the plaintiff, having the affirmative of the issue, must go forward with the evidence.

In the present case, it is undisputed that the loss was due to fire which destroyed the company's warehouse with its contents, including the property in question. The fire occurred in the early morning when the depot and warehouse were closed. The cause of the fire did not appear, and there was nothing in the circumstances to indicate neglect on the part of the railway company. The trial court denied the motion for a direction of a verdict, and charged the jury that 'the burden of showing that there was no negligence is on the defendant.' Applying the rule established by the state decisions ( Brunson v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. 76 S. C. 9, 9 L.R.A.(N.S.) 577, 56 S. E. 538; Fleischman v. Southern R. Co. 76 S. C. 237, 9 L.R.A.(N.S.) 519, 56 S. E. 974; see also Wardlaw v. South Carolina R. Co. 11 Rich. L. 337), the supreme court of the state overruled the defendant's objection and sustained the judgment. 99 S. C. p. 424. It has been recognized by the state court, as was said in the Fleischman Case, supra, that the rule it applies is a 'somewhat exceptional rule' to which the court adheres 'notwithstanding the great number of opposing authorities in other jurisdictions.' 76 S. C. p. 248.\n For the reasons we have stated, we think that the obligation of the railway company was not governed by the state law, and that, in this view, the exceptions of the plaintiff in error were well taken.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As amended by Act June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. 586, c. 3591,  2 (Comp.

STATE OF OKLAHOMA(1916)\nNo. 124\nArgued: Decided: June 12, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 582, 583]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. S. Arnold for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. R. E. Wood, Smith C. Matson, and Mr. S. P. Freeling, Attorney General of Oklahoma, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action on a bail bond given by an accused held upon a charge of adultery to await the action of the grand jury at McAlester, in the Indian Territory. The bond was given shortly before Oklahoma became a state, named the United States as the obligee, and called for the accused's appearance before the temporary court at McAlester at the next term and from term to term until discharged. When the courts of the new state were organized, an indictment for the adultery was returned against the accused in the state court at McAlester. He did not appear, a forfeiture was declared, and the state sued on the bond, the surety alone being reached by the process. There was a judgment for the state, which \n\n[241 U.S. 582, 584]\n\u00a0\n was affirmed (34 Okla. 781, 127 Pac. 409), and the surety sued out this writ of error.\n The Federal questions presented involve the construction and application of the enabling act, and are, first, whether, after the admission of the state, the further proceedings upon the charge of adultery were to be had in a Federal court or in a state court; and, second, whether, by operation of law, the state became the beneficiary of the bond and entitled to sue on it.\n By reason of the conditions arising out of the presence of the Five Civilized Tribes no organized territorial government was ever established in the Indian Territory. Up to the time it became a part of the state of Oklahoma it was governed under the immediate direction of Congress, which legislated for it in respect of many matters of local or domestic concern which, in a state, are regulated by the state legislature, and also applied to it many laws dealing with subjects which, under the Constitution, are within Federal rather than state control. In what was done Congress did not contemplate that this situation should be of long duration, but, on the contrary, that the territory should be prepared for early inclusion in a state. Courts designated as 'United States Courts' were temporarily established, and invested with a considerable measure of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and there was also provision for beginning public prosecutions before subordinate magistrates. There being no organized local government, such prosecutions, regardless of their nature, were commenced and conducted in the name of the United States, and in taking bail bonds it was named as the obligee.\n The enabling act (chap 3335, 34 Stat. at L. 267, chap. 2911, 34 Stat. at L. 1286) provided that the new state should embrace the Indian Territory as well as the territory of Oklahoma. It contemplated that the state, by its Constitution, would establish a system of courts of its own, and provided for dividing the state into two dis- \n\n[241 U.S. 582, 585]\n\u00a0\n tricts, and creating therein United States courts like those in other states. The temporary courts were to go out of existence, and this made it necessary to provide for the disposition of the business pending before them in various stages. To that end the following provisions, among others, not material here, were embodied in an amendment to the act (34 Stat. at L. 1286, 1287, chap. 2911):\n'Sec. 16. . . . Prosecutions for all crimes and offenses committed within the territory of Oklahoma or in the Indian Territory, pending in the district courts of the territory of Oklahoma or in the United States courts in the Indian Territory upon the admission of such territories as a state, which, had they been committed within a state, would have been cognizable in the Federal courts, shall be transferred to and be proceeded with in the United States circuit or district court established by this act for the district in which the offenses were committed, in the same manner and with the same effect as if they had been committed within a state.'\n\n'Sec. 20. That all causes, proceedings, and matters, civil or criminal, pending in the district courts of Oklahoma territory, or in the United States courts in the Indian Territory, at the time said territories become a state, not transferred to the United States circuit or district courts in the state of Oklahoma, shall be proceeded with, held, and determined by the courts of said state, the successors of said district courts of the territory of Oklahoma, and the United States courts in the Indian Territory; . . . All criminal cases pending in the United States courts in the Indian Territory, not transferred to the United States circuit or district courts in the state of Oklahoma, shall be prosecuted to a final determination in the state courts of Oklahoma under the laws now in force in that territory.'\n\n Section 28 of the schedule to the state Constitution referred to these and other closely related provisions, and \n\n[241 U.S. 582, 586]\n\u00a0\n said, they 'are hereby accepted and the jurisdiction of the cases enumerated therein is hereby assumed by the courts of the state.'\n Thus, by the concurrent action of Congress and the state, all prosecutions pending in the temporary courts of the Indian Territory, for offenses which would not have been cognizable in a court of the United States had they been committed within a state, were to be proceeded with in the courts of the state, as successors to the temporary courts. In other words, the test of the jurisdiction of the state courts was to be the same that would have applied had the Indian Territory been a state when the offenses were committed. In this view it is plain that the prosecution in question was rightly proceeded with in the state court. Adultery is an offense against the marriage relation, and belongs to the class of subjects which each state controls in its own way. It is a punishable offense only where the common or statute law of the state makes it such; and where punishable, it is cognizable only in the courts of the state. Of course, we exclude from present consideration forts, arsenals, and like places within the exterior limits of a state, but over which exclusive jurisdiction has been ceded to the United States, because they are regarded, not as part of the state, but as excepted out of it. And we pass the question of the power of Congress to deal with such offenses in respect of tribal Indians within a state, because the statute under which this prosecution arose was general in its terms, and because it is not claimed that either of the participants in the adulterous act was an Indian.\n Some reliance is placed upon  14 of the enabling act, which refers in part to offenses committed prior to the state's admission; but of this section it is enough for present purposes to say that when it is read in connection with the provisions of  16 and 20, before quoted, it is apparent that it was intended to mark the line separating \n\n[241 U.S. 582, 587]\n\u00a0\n the jurisdiction of the Federal courts in the two districts, as between themselves, and not the line separating their jurisdiction from that of the state courts.\n Because no indictment was returned in the temporary court at McAlester before the state was admitted, it is contended that this prosecution was not 'pending' in that court in the sense of  16 and 20. These sections included all pending 'causes, proceedings, and matters,' as well as 'prosecutions' and 'cases,' and evidently were designed to be very comprehensive. The accused not only was held by a magistrate to await the action of the grand jury at the next term of the temporary court, but gave bail for his appearance in the court at that term. After this was done we think a prosecution or proceeding was pending in the court in the sense of the statute. That no indictment was returned in that court in explained by the fact that the court, through the state's admission, went out of existence before an indictment could be found and returned in regular course.\n The enabling act and the state Constitution united in declaring that the state courts, in repect of the prosecutions which were to be transferred to them, should be the successors of the temporary courts. The bail bond was given several months after the act and the state Constitution were adopted. Indeed, the state's admission was imminent at the time. So, the bond must be taken as given with the approaching change in mind, and as meaning that the accused's appearance should be in the state court as the legal successor of the temporary court, if the latter should go out of existence before the time for appearance arrived. The law existing when a contract is made, and affecting its performance, becomes a part of it. Northern P. R. Co. v. Wall, \n241 U.S. 87\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493.\n The enabling act, when taken in connection with the schedule to the state Constitution, leaves no doubt that the state was to take the place of the United States in \n\n[241 U.S. 582, 588]\n\u00a0\n dealing with and conducting this prosecution. The bail bond was essentially a part of the proceeding that was transferred, and was without force or value in any other connection. So, when the power and duty resting upon the United States were passed to the state, there went with them the right to use and enforce the bond as the United States might have done, had the proceeding remained in its control; in other words, the state became, by operation of law, the beneficiary of the bond, and was entitled to sue on it when its condition was broken.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","178":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN WISCONSIN RY. CO. v. CITY OF MADISON(1916)\nNo. 260\nArgued: Decided: March 20, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 457, 458]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Burr W. Jones and E. J. B. Schubring for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. William Ryan for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 457, 459]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit brought by the city of Madison to recover the cost of asphalt pavement between the rails of the defendant's track and 1 foot on the outside of them, for a certain distance along University avenue in that city. The declaration, after stating the ordinances under which the defendant and its predecessors had built and operated the street railway concerned, sets out an ordinance of June 11, 1910, requiring the defendant, under a penalty, to do the work above described. The defendant answered that to make it pay the cost would deprive it of its property and contract rights under its franchise without due process of law and the equal protection of the laws, contrary to the Constitution of the United States. The judge before whom the case was tried found that the designated space had become so out of repair as to interfere with travel, and that the crushed stone then used was not a proper pavement, and would interfere with the asphalt laid down by the city, and gave judgment for the plaintiff. The supreme court accepted the defendant's position, that its charter was a contract, but met the argument based upon it by a construction that warranted the later ordinance, and judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed. 156 Wis. 352, L.R.A. --, --, 146 N. W. 492.\n As our opinion is that the judgment should be affirmed, we shall not dwell upon a motion to dismiss made by the defendant in error. The court expressly upheld the later ordinance, and whether that ordinance can be upheld without impairing the obligation of the admitted contract of the charter is a Federal question none the less that the answer depends upon the construction of the instrument. Even if the opinion below be read as asserting that the duty existed by the charter alone, irrespective of the later ordinance, still as the ordinance was set up and relied upon in the declaration and was present impelling, \n\n[240 U.S. 457, 460]\n\u00a0\n so far as might be, the decision reached, and was given effect by that decision, we should not dismiss the case. Terre Haute & I. R. Co. v. Indiana, \n194 U.S. 579\n, 48 L. ed. 1124, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 767. We lay on one side a suggestion that runs counter to the opinion below and to common sense, that the later ordinance, when it requires the defendant to do the work under a penalty of not exceeding $50 a day, is not a legislative command, but merely a notice to perform a duty already in force.\n Up to 1892 the defendant's franchise was held under a charter that, after providing for the disposition to be made of snow on the track, continued: 'And said company shall keep the space between the rails and for the distance of 1 foot on the outside side of the rails in proper repair so as not to interfere with travel over the same, and shall keep the same in proper order as to cleanliness at its own cost and expense.' The charter then went on to provide that whenever a street in which were tracks should be paved or macadamized, the railway company should pave or macadamize the above-mentioned space and keep it in equally good and corresponding condition. In 1892, a new ordinance was passed authorizing the company to build and operate a road in the city and to use electricity as a motive power upon its tracks then or thereafter authorized and constructed. It had the above-quoted provision as to keeping the space in repair, and the grant was made 'subject to such reasonable rules and regulations respecting such streets and highways and operation of cars as the said council may from time to time enact,' but the ordinance did not repeat the provision as to paving. The supreme court held that the requirement to keep the space in repair was enough, and, by a diminished majority, that the ordinance of 1910 fell within the reasonable rules and regulations that the company was bound to obey.\n If there had been no ordinance of 1910, but the suit \n\n[240 U.S. 457, 461]\n\u00a0\n had been brought simply upon the alleged duty under the charter of 1892, and the city had recovered, as it might have upon the present interpretation of that instrument, there would have been no question for this court. Fisher v. New Orleans, \n218 \nU.S. 438, 440\n, 54 S. L. ed. 1099, 1100, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 57. While this consideration has not required us to dismiss the writ of error, it suggests reasons of more than usual force for following that interpretation. Although we all agree that in this class of cases it is our duty to see that parties are not deprived of their constitutional rights under the guise of construction, still the mere fact that without the state decision we might have hesitated is not enough to lead us to overrule that decision upon a fairly doubtful point.

We appreciate the argument to be drawn from the omission of the paving clause in the charter of 1892, and the possible reason for its omission in the fact that the experiment of substituting electricity for horse power then was relatively new. But it is also possible that the clause was deemed superfluous, if, indeed, the omission should be considered at all. Charles River Bridge v.

CO. v. CAMPBELL(1916)\nNo. 325\nArgued: April 26, 1916Decided: June 12, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 497, 498]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Will G. Graves, F. H. Graves, and B. H. Kizer for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. H. Lowndes Maury, E. H. Belden, W. C. Losey, and H. R. Newton for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought by Campbell in the United States district court for the eastern district of Washington to recover damages for personal injuries, and was based upon the Federal employers' liability act of April 22, 1908 (chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657), and the safety appliance act of March 2, 1893, as amended March 2, 1903 ( chap. 196, 27 Stat. at L. 531, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8605; chap. 976, 32 Stat. at L. 943, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8613). A judgment in plaintiff's favor was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals (133 C. C. A. 370, 217 Fed. 518), and the case comes here on writ of error.\n At the time of Campbell's injury, July 31, 1909, the company was operating a single track electric railway between the city of Spokane, in the state of Washington, and the town of Coeur d'Alene, in the state of Idaho. It was operated under standard railroad rules. The running time of regular trains was fixed by a time-table, upon which they were designated by numbers. Special trains were run by telegraphic orders given by a train despatcher, whose office was in Spokane. Under the rules, regular trains were superior to special trains, and specials were required to look out for and keep out of the way of \n\n[241 U.S. 497, 499]\n\u00a0\n the regulars. Unless a special train had orders from the train despatcher, fixing a meeting point with the regular train, or in some other way giving it a right to disregard the time when the latter was due according to the time-table, it was required to be clear of the main line at any point five minutes before the regular train was due at that point according to the time-table. Campbell was an experienced motorman, had been in the company's employ for several years, and was conversant with its rules and its methods of train operation. On the day he was injured he was the motorman in charge of a special train running between Spokane and Coeur d'Alene, made up of a combined motor and passenger car and two trailers, and referred to in the train orders as Motor 5, that being the number of the motor car. The train was equipped with Westinghouse air brakes. After several trips between the termini, it was at Coeur d'Alene about 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon, ready to start for Spokane when ordered to do so. Regular train No. 20 was about due to arrive. Under orders presently to be mentioned, the nature of which was in dispute, Campbell started his train west from Coeur d'Alene, and had proceeded some distance when he discovered a train approaching on the same track from the opposite direction. Upon seeing this, he applied the brakes, without success, and there was a collision, in which he received serious personal injuries. The train with which he collided was regular No. 20.\n His complaint in the action counted upon two grounds of recovery: (a) That the company, through its agents and employees, negligently instructed him to proceed with his train from Coeur d'Alene to Spokane, and to meet and pass No. 20 at the town of Alan, a station west of the point of collision; and (b) that the collision was directly due to the failure of the company to furnish him with a motor and train supplied with proper air brakes \n\n[241 U.S. 497, 500]\n\u00a0\n in working condition. The action was tried before the district court and a jury, when evidence was introduced to the following effect:\n Campbell testified that having arrived in Coeur d' Alene with his train about 4:20 P. M., and brought it into position to return to Spokane, he received through the conductor, Whittlesey, orders both written and oral for the running of the train; that the written order said that 'motor 5 would run special Coeur d'Alene to Spokane and would meet Number 20 at Alan;' that when the written order was received Campbell was in his cab, ready to start, and that the conductor, on delivering the order to him, said: 'All right, go ahead; get out of town.' Campbell was unable to produce the written order. If its contents were as he testified, he was justified in at once leaving Coeur d'Alene and running to Alan, the order giving him a right of way over all trains to that point. But defendant's evidence was to the effect that the written order actually read: 'Motor 5 will run spl. C. d'Alene to Spokane, meet spl. 4 east at Alan.' Campbell admitted that if this was in fact the order, it did not authorize him to leave Coeur d'Alene before No. 20 came in, for it made no mention of that train, and did not supersede the right given to it by rules and time-table. Nor was it contended in his behalf that the conductor's verbal order could in any way modify the written order. It appeared that there was a land registration in progress at Coeur d'Alene, and because of the resulting rush of travel incoming trains stopped at the west end of the yard and went on a Y switch, where the train was turned and then backed down to the Coeur d'Alene station, while trains ready to leave Coeur d'Alene, upon the arrival of an incoming train, would run to the end of the yard, between the legs of the Y, wait there for the incoming train, and pull out as soon as it headed in on the Y. Whittlesey testified that he intended the train to go to the Y and \n\n[241 U.S. 497, 501]\n\u00a0\n wait there for No. 20. Because, as Campbell testified, his orders were to go to Alan to meet No. 20, he did not stop at the Y. He testified that soon after passing this point, and while running at about 30 miles per hour (there was a slight descending grade), he saw an east-bound train (it was proved to be No. 20), coming on the same track at a distance which, from his testimony and that of others, might have been found to be upwards of 800 feet. He immediately shut off the power, and then 'dynamited her,' that is, threw his air brake into emergency so as to apply the air pressure upon the train brakes to the full capacity. He testified in effect that the brakes took hold properly, and held for approximately 35 or 40 feet, when the air released (another witness said it 'leaked off'), and after that there was nothing he could do to stop the train except to reverse, which he endeavored to do but without success. There was no hand brake. He testified that if the air brakes had worked properly he could have stopped his train and avoided a collision; that when they took hold they reduced the speed to about 20 miles per hour; that when released the train shot forward at approximately 18 or 20 miles an hour; 'then I stopped it a little bit with my reverse, so that at the moment of collision I think we were going about 15 miles an hour.' No. 20 meanwhile had been brought almost, if not quite, to a stop.\n Under instructions from the trial court the jury, besides reurning a general verdict, which was in favor of the plaintiff, with $7,500 damages, made three special findings in writing: (1) That Campbell, before leaving Coeur d'Alene, received a train order reading as follows: 'Motor 5 will run Spl. C. d'Alene to Spokane, meet special 4 east at Alan;' (2) that the air brakes on Campbell's train immediately before the collision were insufficient to enable him to control the speed of the train; (3) that Campbell's leaving Coeur d'Alene in violation of \n\n[241 U.S. 497, 502]\n\u00a0\n his orders was the proximate cause of the accident. There was a motion for judgment in favor of defendant on the special findings notwithstanding the general verdict, which was denied, and it is to this ruling as well as to certain instructions given and refused to be given that the assignments of error are addressed.\n The general verdict and the special findings were taken pursuant to the state practice prescribed by certain sections of the Code, permitting the trial judge to instruct the jury, if they render a general verdict, to find upon particular questions of fact, to be stated in writing, and providing that 'when a special finding of facts shall be inconsistent with the general verdict, the former shall control the latter, and the court shall give judgment accordingly.' 1 Rem. & Bal. Anno. Code,  364, 365. The rule established by decisions of the supreme court of the state is that where the general verdict and the special findings can be harmonized by taking into consideration the entire record of the cause, including the evidence and the instructions to the jury, and construing it liberally for that purpose, it is the duty of the court to harmonize them; and that where a special finding is susceptible of two constructions, one of which will support the general verdict and the other will not, that construction shall be adopted which will support the general verdict.

A. 514, 180 Fed. 368, 372.\n The court of appeals held (133 C. C. A. 370, 217 Fed. 523) that the Federal courts are not bound by local rules of practice with respect to submitting special findings along with a general verdict, or with respect to interpreting such verdicts; and that in this case it must be determined as matter of law, and without reference to the testimony, whether the special findings entitled defendant to judgment notwithstanding the general verdict.\n We find it unnecessary to decide the question of practice, and laying aside all technicalities will assume, in favor of plaintiff in error, that the verdict is to be interpreted according to the local rule,-that is, by reading the special findings in the light of the issues and the evidence, but in the light also of the general verdict, so as to arrive at the true intent and meaning of the jury. So considered, the findings establish that there was no negligence on the part of the company in giving Campbell his running orders; that he received the order to meet Special 4 east at Alan, which, according to the admitted effect of the rules of the company, meant that he should not leave Coeur d'Alene until the arrival of regular No. 20; that he left Coeur d'Alene in disregard or violation of his orders, and that this was 'the proximate cause' of the accident. At the same time, the special findings establish that the air brakes on his train immediately before the collision were insufficient to enable him to control the speed of the train. And the general verdict, so far as \n\n[241 U.S. 497, 504]\n\u00a0\n it is supported by the evidence, must be taken as establishing every other fact in issue, not eliminated by the instructions of the trial court, that may be necessary to sustain the recovery. To quote from the brief of plaintiff in error: 'The special findings establish that the general verdict was based solely upon the theory of negligence in the air-brake equipment of the train.' But the general verdict, interpreted in the light of the instructions given by the trial court to the jury, means not merely that the braking equipment was defective, but that this was a proximate cause of the collision. The instruction upon this point was: 'If . . . you find from a preponderance of the testimony that the air brakes on the car and train operated by the plaintiff were defective and out of repair at and immediately prior to the time of the collision, and that the defective condition of the air brakes was the direct and proximate cause of the collision, or contributed directly and proximately to the collision, and to the injury to the plaintiff, your verdict will be for the plaintiff . . . . And before you can return a verdict for the plaintiff based on the allegation that the brakes were defective and out of repair, you must be satisfied from a preponderance of the testimony not only that the brakes were in fact defective or out of repair, but that their defective condition was the direct or proximate cause of the collision, as I have defined that term to you.' It is true that other parts of the charge indicate that the trial court entertained the view that the proximate cause must be either Campbell's disobedience of orders or the defective air-brake equipment, and that these two things could not concur as proximate causes. But he did not bind the jury by instructions to that effect; and viewing the general verdict and the special findings together, in the light of the issues, the evidence, and the entire charge, it is evident, we repeat, that the jury must have found that the defective air brakes were a proximate cause of \n\n[241 U.S. 497, 505]\n\u00a0\n the collision. In view of the testimony already mentioned, to the effect that Campbell, after discovering train No. 20, would have had ample time to avoid the collision had the train-brake equipment been adequate, the conclusion of the jury was in this respect not unreasonable.\n It is insisted that there was no evidence that the provision of the safety appliance act respecting train brakes was violated. It is, of course, settled, that if the equipment was in fact defective or out of repair, the question whether this was attributable to the company's negligence is immaterial. St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 294\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1061, 1067, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616, 21 Am. Neg. Rep. 464; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 559, 575\n, 55 S. L. ed. 335, 341, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 259; Texas & P. R. Co. v. Rigsby, \n241 \nU.S. 33, 43\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 482. Hence the argument is that, according to all of the evidence, the equipment was not defective or out of repair. It appeared without dispute that it consisted of the Westinghouse standard automatic air brake, such as is in general use throughout the country upon passenger trains. A witness in defendant's employ testified that shortly before Campbell took the train out from Coeur d'Alene on the trip in question he inspected the air brakes and found them in perfect order. But there was much evidence besides that of Campbell himself, to the effect that when he applied the emergency, the brakes took hold and then leaked off, so as to release the brakes. The jury was warranted in finding from the testimony as a whole that Campbell properly applied the air when 600 feet or more from the place where the collision occurred, and that the brakes refused to work. Expert witnesses called by defendant testified in effect that the train could have been stopped inside of 300 feet if the brakes had been in proper order. The air- brake equipment was wrecked in the collision, so that there was no explanation of the cause of its failure to operate properly; but it was a reasonable inference that there was some defect or want of repair in the valves or packing. \n\n[241 U.S. 497, 506]\n\u00a0\n Next, it is insisted that Campbell's train was not such as the safety appliance acts require to be equipped with air brakes. In Spokane & I. E. R. Co. v. United States, decided June 5, 1916, \n241 U.S. 344\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 668, we held that this same railroad, with respect to its interurban traffic, is subject to the provisions of those acts respecting automatic couplers, and hand holds or grab irons at the ends of the cars. In that case the particular reliance of the company was upon the concluding cause of the 1st section of the 1903 amendment (32 Stat. at L. 943, chap. 976, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8613), which excepts trains, cars, etc ., 'which are used upon street railways.' In the present case a distinction is sought to be drawn between steam and electric roads, the argument being that the provision requiring power brakes, when read in connection with the context, indicates that trains drawn by steam locomotives and operated by a locomotive engineer were alone within the contemplation of Congress. It is true that in the act of 1893 the provision was closely associated with the mention of a locomotive engine as the motive power; the words of  1 being: 'It shall be unlawful for any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad to use on its line any locomotive engine in moving interstate traffic not equipped with a power driving-wheel brake and appliances for operating the train-brake system, or to run any train in such traffic [after a specified date] that has not a sufficient number of cars in it so equipped with power or train brakes that the engineer on the locomotive drawing such train can control its speed without requiring brakemen to use the common hand brake for that purpose.' Section 6, prescribing penalties, also uses the words 'locomotive engine' and 'locomotives.' But the 1903 amendment, which, as frequently pointed out, was enacted for the purpose of enlarging the scope of the act (Southern R. Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20, 26\n, 56 S. L. ed. 72, 74, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 2, 3 N. C. C. A. 822; Southern R. Co. v. Crockett, \n234 \nU.S. 725, 735\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1564, 1568, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 897), in its 1st section declares \n\n[241 U.S. 497, 507]\n\u00a0\n that the provisions relating to train brakes (among others) shall be held to apply to 'all trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce . . . and to all other locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used in connection therewith,' subject to exceptions not now pertinent. The 2d section declares that whenever any train is operated with power or train brakes, 'not less than fifty per centum of the cars in such train shall have their brakes used and operated by the engineer of the locomotive drawing such train.' Of course, an important object of having a train equipped with a system of brakes under the single control of the engineer is to permit of a prompt and effective reduction of speed when the man driving the train is notified of danger. The importance of this is precisely the same, whatever be the motive power; and, in view of the beneficial purpose of the act and the evident intent of Congress to enlarge its scope so far as necessary to guard against the dangers in view, the term 'similar vehicles' must be held to have the effect of bringing electric motors and trains drawn by them within the provision respecting power or train brakes. The very exemption of trains, cars, and locomotives 'used upon street railways' indicates that electric cars were in contemplation. And see Omaha & C. B. Street R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n230 \nU.S. 324, 337\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1501, 1506, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 385, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 890; Kansas City Western R. Co. v. McAdow, \n240 \nU.S. 51, 54\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 252.\n It is said that, conceding the power-brake provision applies to electric trains, the duty imposed was not owed to Campbell under the special circumstances established by the jury's findings. The argument is that the purpose of the brake requirements is to place control of the train in the hands of the engineer so that the safety of passengers and employees may be conserved, not that the engineer should be able to escape injury from peril to which he had wrongfully exposed himself; and that Campbell cannot \n\n[241 U.S. 497, 508]\n\u00a0\n bring himself within the class intended to be protected by pointing out that the situation created by his disobedience of orders was one that Congress contemplated as possible and the consequences of which it desired to guard against. This gives altogether too narrow a meaning to the safety appliance act, and is inconsistent with the provisions of the employers' liability act, as we shall see.\n It is most earnestly insisted that the findings established that Campbell was not in the course of his employment when he was injured, and consequently that judgment could not properly be entered in his favor upon the cause of action established by the general verdict. This invokes the doctrine that where an employee voluntarily and without necessity growing out of his work abandons the employment and steps entirely aside from the line of his duty, he suspends the relation of employer and employee, and puts himself in the attitude of a stranger or a licensee. The cases cited are those where an employee intentionally has gone outside of the scope of his employment, or departed from the place of duty. The present case is not of that character; for Campbell, as the jury might and presumably did find, had no thought of stepping aside from the line of his duty. From the fact that he disregarded and in effect violated the order as actually communicated to him, it, of course, does not necessarily follow that he did this wilfully. The jury was not bound to presume-it would hardly be reasonable to presume-that he deliberately and intentionally ran his train out upon a single track on which he knew an incoming train with superior rights was then due. However plain his mistake, the jury reasonably might find it to be no more than a mistake attributable to mental aberration, or inattention, or failure for some other reason to apprehend or comprehend the order communicated to him. In its legal effect this was nothing more than negligence on his part, and not a departure from the course of his employment. \n\n[241 U.S. 497, 509]\n\u00a0\n To hold otherwise would have startling consequences. The running of trains on telegraphic orders is an everyday occurrence on every railroad in the country. Thousands of cases occur every day and every night where a failure by conductor or engineer to comprehend or to remember the message of the train despatcher may endanger the lives of employees and passengers. We are not aware that in any case it has been seriously contended that because an engineer violated the orders, he went outside of the scope of the employment. If he did so, in the sense of absolving the employer from the duty of exercising care for his safety, it is not easy to see upon what principle the employer's liability to passengers or to fellow employees for the consequences of his negligence could be maintained. The unsoundness of the contention is so apparent that further discussion is unnecessary.\n Plaintiff in error refers to the fact that the wreck occurred in Idaho, and cites two sections of the Criminal Code of that state, one rendering a wilful violation or omission of duty on the part of one in Campbell's position, whereby human life or safety is endangered, punishable as a misdemeanor; the other making wilful or negligent conduct which causes a collision of trains, and the resulting death of a human being, a criminal offense. 2 Idaho Rev. Codes  6926, 6909. Whether Campbell was or is punishable criminally under either of these sections we are not called upon to say. But his right to recover against his employer depends upon the acts of Congress, to which all state legislation affecting the subject-matter must yield. Texas & P. R. Co. v. Rigsby, \n241 \nU.S. 33, 41\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 482.\n Upon the whole case, we have no difficulty in sustaining his right of action under the employers' liability act. That act ( 1, 35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8657) imposes a liability for injury to an employee 'resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency due \n\n[241 U.S. 497, 510]\n\u00a0\n to its negligence in its cars, engines, appliances, . . . or other equipment.' As was held in San Antonio & A. Pass R. Co. v. Wagner, decided June 5, 1916, \n241 U.S. 476\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 626, a violation of the safety appliance act is 'negligence' within the meaning of the liability act. And by the proviso to  3 of the latter act, no employee injured or killed shall be held to have been guilty of contributory negligence in any case where a violation of the safety appliance act 'contributed to the injury or death of such employee.' It is too plain for argument that under this legislation the violation of the safety appliance act need not be the sole efficient cause, in order that an action may lie. The circuit court of appeals (133 C. C. A. 370, 217 Fed. 524) held that the element of proximate cause is eliminated where concurring acts of the employer and employee contribute to the injury or death of the employee. We agree with this, except that we find it unnecessary to say the effect of the statute is wholly to eliminate the question of proximate cause. But where, as in this case, plaintiff's contributory negligence and defendant's violation of a provision of the safety appliance act are concurring proximate causes, it is plain that the employers' liability act requires the former to be disregarded.\n The assignments of error that are based upon the instructions given and refused to be given to the jury raise no question other than those which have been disposed of.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","180":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPOKANE & I.E.R. CO. v. U.S.(1916)\nNo. 136\nArgued: Decided: June 5, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 344, 345]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Will G. Graves, F. H. Graves, and B. H. Kizer for plaintiff in error.\n Assistant Attorney General Underwood and Mr. John C. Brooke for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The United States brought this suit against the railroad company to recover penalties for fifteen alleged violations of the safety appliance act. The violations consisted in hauling in interstate commerce on October 23, 1911, twelve cars which were not provided with hand holds or grab irons at the ends, as required by the act, and three cars which were not equipped with automatic couplers. The answer admitted that at the time named all fifteen cars had been used in interstate commerce, and that three of them were not equipped with automatic couplers, but denied that the other twelve were not provided with hand holds or grab irons, as required by the act, and denied that it had in any respect violated the act, because all fifteen cars were used by the company upon its line of street railway, and were therefore expressly excepted from the operation of the act. A verdict and judgment against \n\n[241 U.S. 344, 346]\n\u00a0\n the company on all fifteen charges was affirmed by the court below.\n We briefly state the material facts. The railroad company operated a street railway system in Spokane, Washington, and several interurban electric lines, one of which extended from Spokane to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, a distance of about 40 miles. Over this line passenger trains composed of two or more cars were operated, starting at a station near the center of Spokane and running for a mile and a quarter on the street railway tracks to the company's yards near the city limits, and thence over its private right of way to Coeur d'Alene. The road was standard gauge, with rails of standard weight, and the passenger trains were made up according to standard railroad rules, with markers to designate the trains, and were run on schedules and by train orders. Passengers traveled on tickets entitling them to ride to and from designated stations, at which regular stops were made, and express matter and baggage were carried on the passenger trains. The streetcar business was entirely separate from that done by the interurban line, the employees of the one having nothing whatever to do with the other, and although stops were made by interurban trains within the city limits, and while on the street railway tracks, they were made solely for the purpose of taking on and letting off passengers to or from stations outside the city. In addition to its passenger trains, the interurban line also operated freight trains, which, however, started from the company's yards and ran directly to Coeur d'Alene, and did not, therefore, enter upon the street railway tracks.\n The fifteen cars here in question were passenger cars, and on the day named were used in passenger trains which were run from the station in Spokane to the city limits, and thence over the company's right of way to Coeur d'Alene. Twelve of them (those which it was charged were not equipped at the ends with grab irons or hand \n\n[241 U.S. 344, 347]\n\u00a0\n holds) were cars regularly used on the interurban lines, and were rounded at the ends and equipped with radial couplers to enable the trains to make sharp turns. As the swinging of these couplers from one side to the other across the ends of the cars would break off grab irons of the type ordinarily used on the ends of cars, they were not used. It was claimed, however, that the requirements of the safety appliance act with respect to hand holds or grab irons were in substance complied with by a different, and what was asserted to be an equivalent, appliance; that is, openings in the top of the buffer or sill extending across the ends of the cars, just above the couplers. To support this claim the company offered testimony of experienced railroad men to the effect 'that the hand holds or grab irons in the buffers or sills of such cars were sufficient to protect men who might be required to go between the cars in coupling or otherwise handling them, that they were sufficient to accomplish purposes intended to be accomplished by the provisions of the safety appliance act requiring hand holds or grab irons to be placed upon the ends of cars used in interstate commerce, and that they were better than those commonly used upon cars engaged in interstate commerce.' The United States objected to the introduction of the testimony, and it was excluded on the ground 'that it was not a question for expert testimony, but was a matter of common knowledge.' During the trial (at whose request it does not appear) the jury were taken to inspect the openings in some of the cars.\n The other three cars were large street cars which were regularly used only on the street railway tracks, but which, because of unusually heavy traffic on the day named, were coupled together with link and pin couplers and operated as a train to Coeur d'Alene.\n The assignments of error present two questions which we consider separately. \n\n[241 U.S. 344, 348]\n\u00a0\n 1. It is urged that error was committed in construing the safety appliance act, since, when correctly interpreted, the fifteen cars in question were expressly excepted from its requirements. To appreciate the contentions based upon this proposition it is necessary to recur to the text of the original act and the amendments thereto. By the act of March 2, 1893 (chap. 196, 27 Stat. at L. 531, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8605), it was made unlawful for any common carrier 'to haul or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car used in moving interstate traffic not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact' ( 2), or 'to use any car in interstate commerce that is not provided with secure grab irons or hand holds in the ends and sides of each car for greater security to men in coupling and uncoupling cars' ( 4), with the proviso that the prohibitions of the act should not apply to 'trains composed of four-wheel cars or to locomotives used in hauling such trains' ( 6). By the act of April 1, 1896 (chap. 87, 29 Stat. at L. 85, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8610) the proviso of  6 was amended as follows: 'That nothing in this act contained shall apply to trains of four-wheel cars or to trains composed of eight- wheel standard logging cars . . . or to locomotives used in hauling such trains when such cars or locomotives are exclusively used for the transportation of logs.' By the amendment of March 2, 1903 (chap. 976, 32 Stat. at L. 943, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8613), the provisions of the act relating to automatic couplers, grab irons, etc., were extended and made applicable to 'all trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce, and in the territories and the District of Columbia, and to all other locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used in connection therewith,' and to the exceptions from the requirements of the original act and the amendment of 1896 were added 'trains, cars, and locomotives . . . which are used upon street railways.'\n The contention is that as the trains in which the fifteen cars were hauled were operated over the street railway \n\n[241 U.S. 344, 349]\n\u00a0\n tracks from the station in Spokane to the yards of the company, they were 'used upon street railways,' and were hence expressly exempted from the requirements of the act by the amendment of 1903. This, it is said, results from the unambiguous text of the exception contained in that amendment, and is from a twofold point of view made additionally certain by the context of the act which we have quoted. The argument is that the word 'used' in the amendment of 1903, excepting cars, etc., 'used upon street railways,' must be construed as having the same significance as the same word in the amendment making the act applicable to all cars, etc., 'used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce.' From this premise it is insisted that as the latter provision has been construed as enlarging the scope of the act by causing it to embrace all cars used on interstate commerce railroads, although at the particular time the cars are employed in intrastate commerce (Southern R. Co. v. United States, \n222 U.S. 20\n, 56 L. ed. 72, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 2, 3 N. C. C. A. 822), it must follow that the word 'used' in the street railway excepting clause under consideration must have the same construction, and therefore exclude from the operation of the act all cars used upon street railways, however temporary such use, and however frequent or material may be their use in interstate commerce on other than street railways. Again, it is urged that the judgment of the court below can be affirmed only by construing the word 'used' in the exception as meaning exclusively used,-a construction which, it is said, would be wholly unwarranted in view of the amendment of 1896, excepting from the act certain cars, etc., 'exclusively used for the transportation of logs,' and the demonstration thereby afforded that if such a meaning had been contemplated by Congress in the amendment of 1903, the word 'exclusively' would have been employed. But we think the want of merit in the contentions is clear, and the unsoundness of the argument ad- \n\n[241 U.S. 344, 350]\n\u00a0\n vanced to sustain them apparent. We say this because, while it is conceded that the obvious purpose of Congress in enacting the law and its amendments was to secure the safety of railroad employees, and that the amendment of 1903 sought to enlarge and make that purpose more complete, yet it is insisted that the exception in the act should receive such a broad construction as would destroy the plain purpose which caused the act to be adopted. But to so treat the act would be in plain disregard of the elementary rule requiring that exceptions from a general policy which a law embodies should be strictly construed; that is, should be so interpreted as not to destroy the remedial processes intended to be accomplished by the enactment. That the meaning contended for would be in direct conflict with this rule would seem free from doubt, since the inevitable result of sustaining the contention would be to put it in the power of a railroad, by operating a train for a trifling distance over tracks within the exception, to thereby secure the right thereafter to operate such train over long distances without regard to compliance with the safeguards of the statute which otherwise would be controlling. And this reasoning disposes of the contention deduced from the use of the word 'exclusively' in the provision excepting cars used on logging railroads, and its absence in the street railway clause, since, on the face of the statute, the object of both provisions was to exempt both the logging and street railway cars from the operation of the act only when used for logging, on the one hand, and on street railways, on the other, and not to exempt them when not so used.\n The suggestion is made in argument that in any event the railroad company was not liable for the penalties because of the difficulty of equipping the twelve cars with grab irons which would not interfere with the lateral movement of the radial couplers, and because the other three cars were so constructed that they could not be \n\n[241 U.S. 344, 351]\n\u00a0\n provided with automatic couplers, and were used only on the one day because of unusually heavy traffic. But this merely asserts that the statute may be violated with impunity if only the railroad finds its provisions onerous, or deems it expedient to do so.\n\n 2. \nIt is contended that error was committed in rejecting the testimony of experts offered by the railroad company as to the protection afforded to employees by the openings in the buffers at the ends of the twelve cars. Without stopping to point out the inappositeness of the many authorities cited in support of the contention, we think the court was clearly right in holding that the question was not one for experts, and that the jury, after hearing the testimony and inspecting the openings, were competent to determine the issue, particularly in view of the full and clear instruction given on the subject, concerning which no complaint is made.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","181":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS & KANSAS CITY LAND CO. v. KANSAS CITY(1916)\nNo. 261\nArgued: March 7, 1916Decided: June 5, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 419, 420]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. I. N. Watson, H. M. Langworthy, Kenneth MaC. De Weese, Edward White, and Elliott M. Jones for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Jesse C. Petherbridge, Arthur F. Smith, and Andrew F. Evans for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a supplemental proceeding to assess certain parcels of land in Kansas City, Missouri, for benefits. The assessments were for the purpose of meeting an unpaid portion of damages which had been awarded for property condemned in widening Sixth street. Judgment for the assessments was entered on the verdict of a jury and was affirmed by the supreme court of Missouri, in banc. 260 Mo. 395, 169 S. W. 62. This writ of error is prosecuted by owners of property thus assessed.\n In October, 1909, the common council of Kansas City passed an ordinance providing for the condemnation of property within specified limits, and for the raising of the amount of the award by special assessments against property within a described benefit district, in accordance with article 6 of the city's charter. Proceedings ac- \n\n[241 U.S. 419, 421]\n\u00a0\n cordingly were then brought in the municipal court of Kansas City, resulting in an award of $166,299.57 for property taken and in the making of assessments of like amount for benefits. There were over 13,000 different tracts within the benefit district. No appeal was taken from the judgment. The city collected on the assessments about $89,000. It was discovered that the publication of the required notice of the proceeding was defective, and in an appropriate suit in equity, brought by the Union Pacific Railroad Company, a decree was obtained in favor of that company, and of certain interveners, annulling the assessments against their properties; and no appeal was taken from that decree.\n Thereupon, Kansas City attempted to repeal the original ordinance, presumably-as the state court suggests-for the purpose of abandoning the proceeding and returning the assessments paid. At the suit of owners of the land condemned-who were entitled to the awards-decree was entered enjoining the city from abandoning the condemnation proceedings. The city then enacted a 'supplemental or curative ordinance,' basing its action on the authority of  231 of article 6 of the city's charter. \n\n[241 U.S. 419, 422]\n\u00a0\n 'The object of said sensible charter provision,' it is said by the state court, 'was to afford a remedy when by any error, defect, or omission in condemnation proceedings, assessments made against private property cannot be enforced or collected, or where property in the benefit district is omitted, etc. In such case it was provided that the city may, by ordinance, institute and carry on supplemental proceedings to make a proper assessment against any parcel of property in the benefit district erroneously omitted or erroneously made in the first proceeding, etc.' 260 Mo. p. 406.\n Under this ordinance the supplemental proceeding was instituted in the municipal court. The notice required by the charter was given and the plaintiffs in error (with the exception of the Union Depot Bridge & Terminal Railroad Company) appeared. The jury returned a verdict which was 'the same as to the amount of benefits as the verdict returned in the original proceeding.' State ex rel. Graham v. Seehorn, 246 Mo. 541, 552, 151 S. W. 716; see 260 Mo. p. 406. An appeal was taken from the judgment to the circuit court of Jackson county. While \n\n[241 U.S. 419, 423]\n\u00a0\n the case was pending in that court, the presiding judge, having announced that he purposed to 'try out the question of the amount of damages awarded to property owners whose property was taken or damaged under the original proceeding as well as the question of assessing benefits over nonpaying properties within the benefit district,' two prohibition suits were brought in the supreme court of the state. The one was brought by owners of property in the benefit district who contended that the municipal court had no jurisdiction of either the original or the supplemental proceedings, and hence that the circuit court had no jurisdiction on appeal. This contention was overruled and the writ denied. State ex rel. Graham v. Seehorn, supra; see 260 Mo. p. 407. The other prohibition suit was brought by the owners of property which was sought to be taken for public use. They urged that there was no provision for an appeal in a supplemental proceeding begun in the municipal court, and that, in any event, the circuit court had no jurisdiction to award damages. The court sustained the right of appeal, but it was held that the verdict and judgment in the original proceedings were valid 'as to those who appeared and accepted them;' that the original proceedings, unappealed from, became res judicata. The jury were not to include in their verdict 'assessments of benefits and damages upon property properly included in the first verdict.' In answer to the contention that property owners in the benefit district were entitled to be heard on the question of the amount to be paid for the property taken in condemnation, the court ruled that, while it was entirely proper as a matter of grace to permit such owners to aid the city in preventing an unduly high valuation of the property condemned, they were not necessary parties in the determination of that issue, and that this question was not open to retrial in the supplemental proceedings where the owners of the property condemned \n\n[241 U.S. 419, 424]\n\u00a0\n had acquiesced in the awards. Accordingly, a writ issued prohibiting the circuit court from retrying the question of the amount of damages awarded to the owners of property condemned. State ex rel. Tuller v. Seehorn, 246 Mo. 568, 151 S. W. 724; see 260 Mo. 407-409.\n The circuit court then resumed the trial of the appeal in the supplemental proceeding. The plaintiffs in error appearing (with the exception of the Union Depot Bridge Company) challenged the validity of the proceedings under the state law, and each company also claimed protection under the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment from any assessment of benefits until it had 'opportunity to be heard upon the amount of damages that shall be awarded to property owners and the benefits assessed against it, as provided by the charter of Kansas City in the original proceedings,' and that it was entitled to notice of those proceedings. The right to retry the amount of the award in condemnation was frequently reiterated during the progress of the cause and denied. It was also unsuccessfully contended that the decree in favor of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and interveners, annulling the former assessments as to them, was a bar. The court further ruled, over exceptions, that under the decision of the supreme court the jury was concluded from changing the assessment on the property of those owners who had paid under the original proceedings; and a general offer of testimony assailing such assessments was rejected. It appeared that, after deducting from the total awards of damages for property condemned the amount which had already been paid by property owners, there remained a balance of $76, 981.98. Among the instructions given to the jury (and to each of which a general exception was taken) were the following:\n'This balance you may assess against the city generally, including any benefit to any property of the city \n\n[241 U.S. 419, 425]\n\u00a0\n within the benefit district, and against such of the remaining private property, lots, tracts, and parcels of land, exclusive of the improvements thereon, in the benefit district, as you may deem is benefited, if any, and in the proportion which you may deem the same benefited, by the opening and widening of Sixth street, and upon which no assessments have been paid under the original proceedings.'\n\n'If the jury find and believe from the evidence that the benefits to the city at large and the special benefits to all the property within the benefit district does not equal the damages heretofore awarded for the proposed taking of property for widening Sixth street from Broadway to Bluff streets, or if the jury find that the damages so awarded exceeds in amount all such benefits as would accrue from such widening of Sixth street,-then the jury will so state in their verdict and will assess no benefits in these proceedings.'\n\n'The jury are instructed that, in determining the special benefit, if any, to be assessed against any piece of property, they are not allowed to assess any sum against any piece of property except such sum as they may find said property is actually and specially benefited and enhanced in value, as distinguished from any general benefit such property may receive, if any, in common with other property of the city, by reason of the widening of Sixth street.'\n\n'In passing upon the issue as to whether or not the damages in this case exceed the benefits, the jury should not and must not be influenced by the fact that the damages have been determined by another jury in another proceeding. Private property must not be assessed in excess of the actual benefits accruing thereto, if any, as distinguished from the benefits accruing to the city in general.'\n\n'Upon your request for further instruction in regard \n\n[241 U.S. 419, 426]\n\u00a0\n to your duties as to assessing benefits in this proceeding, you are instructed that you may not assess any benefits in this supplemental proceeding against any property in the benefit district which was adjudged in the original proceeding to have been damaged by reason of a part thereof being taken for the widening of Sixth street from Broadway to Bluff street.'\n\n Among the instructions refused was one (apparently asked by a party not one of the plaintiffs in error, but in whose exception the others joined) to the effect that the property owner was entitled under the 14th Amendment 'to introduce evidence and be heard upon the questions (a) of the cost of the improvement in question to pay which such benefits are to be assessed, and (b) of what proportion of the total benefit, if any, of said improvement, should be assessed against other property in the benefit district, that upon the plat of which is marked the word 'paid' as well as all other property;' and that, inasmuch as the alleged right had been denied, the jury should not assess any benefit.\n The jury rendered a verdict laying assessments upon the properties of the plaintiffs in error, and motions for a new trial were denied. The Union Depot Bridge Company was assessed with two others, jointly, and appeared and objected to the verdict. Thereupon, the court recalled the jurors and directed separate assessments, which were made. The Union Depot Bridge Company asked for an instruction to the effect that a portion of its property had been assessed in the original proceeding, that the assessment had been paid, and that the remainder of the lands were then found not to be benefited and should not be assessed. This instruction was refused. This company also moved for a new trial, insisting that it was deprived of its property without due process of law and denied the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the 14th Amendment. \n\n[241 U.S. 419, 427]\n\u00a0\n On appeal the supreme court of the state entered judgment of affirmance, and it is to review that judgment that this writ of error has been sued out.\n The extent of the authority conferred upon the city by its charter, the construction of the various provisions of the charter, the validity, scope, and effect under the state law of the ordinances adopted by the city, and the scope and effect of the original and supplemental proceedings, and the rights of the parties thereto, under the state law, are state questions, as to which the decision of the state court is controlling.

So, the ruling as to the effect, with respect to the supplemental proceeding, of the decree in a court of the same state, holding the prior assessments void for want of the required notice, as to the complainant in that suit and certain interveners, does not present a Federal question. Phoenix F. & M. Ins. Co. v. Tennessee, \n161 \nU.S. 174, 185\n, 40 S. L. ed. 660, 664, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 471.\n It is also well settled that an owner of property which may be assessed for benefits in order to pay an award for property condemned is not entitled, by virtue of the 14th Amendment, to insist upon being made a party to the condemnation proceeding, or to be heard with respect to the amount of the award. He may not demand, as a Federal right, that the power of eminent domain shall not be exercised save upon notice to him. Voigt v. Detroit, \n184 \nU.S. 115, 122\n, 46 S. L. ed. 459, 462, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337; Goodrich v. Detroit, \n184 \nU.S. 432, 437\n, 438 S., 46 L. ed. 627, 630, 631, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397; Londoner v. Denver, \n210 \nU.S. 373, 378\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1103, 1109, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 708. As well might it be argued, as was suggested in Goodrich v. Detroit, supra, that whenever the city contemplated a public improvement of any description, it would be necessary to give notice to all those who might be taxed to pay for it. The established rule is 'that it is only those whose property is proposed to be taken for a public improvement \n\n[241 U.S. 419, 428]\n\u00a0\n that due process of law requires shall have prior notice.' (Ibid.)\n Nor is there ground for a distinction because the charter of Kansas City provided a single proceeding, embracing both the proposed condemnation and assessment for benefits, and required notice to the property owners within the benefit district. The question under the 14th Amendment is one of state power, not of state policy; of what the state must accord, not of what it may grant or withhold in its discretion. Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 683\n, 42 S. L. ed. 622, 625, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229; Willoughby v. Chicago, \n235 U.S. 45\n, 59 L. ed. 123, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 23. With respect to neither proceeding, original or supplementary, was it essential to due process of law in making assessments that the assessed owners should be heard on the amount of the awards in condemnation. Nor was there a denial of the equal protection of the laws because in the original proceeding there was such an opportunity, together with a right of appeal. The asserted inequality sprang solely from the fact that certain assessed owners, despite the defective publication of notice, appeared and acquiesced in the proceedings. There is no ground for the charge of a denial of equal protection because some owners were willing to waive defects in procedure and others were not. Differences due to voluntary action and diverse individual choices constantly arise under equal laws. We conclude that the contention based on the refusal to reopen the case as to the damages awarded is wholly without merit.\n With respect to the amount of the assessments to pay these damages, it is apparent that the question presented relates solely to the right to insist upon a re-determination of the assessments laid upon the properties of other owners, which those owners had accepted and paid. Under the rulings of the court, none of the plaintiffs in error were assessable except for benefits actually and specially accruing to their respective properties; they were heard as \n\n[241 U.S. 419, 429]\n\u00a0\n to these benefits and as to the amount of their own assessments. Their objection as to the matter of apportionment struck at the finality of the other assessments. In the only instance in which it could be said that any right under the Federal Constitution was specially and appropriately set up as to apportionment it was urged that these owners were entitled to be heard upon 'what proportion of the total benefit, if any, of said improvement, should be assessed against other property in the benefit district, that upon the plat of which is marked the word 'paid' as well as all other property;' and because this was not allowed, and the assessments which had been acquiesced in and paid by other owners were held to be final, a peremptory instruction was asked that the jury should assess no benefits. It is apparent that this objection goes directly to the validity of the supplemental proceeding as such, and denies the power of the state to authorize it. It means that the only proceeding that could constitutionally be taken in such a case would be to have a trial de novo as to all the assessments; and thus, where, as in this instance, thousands of tracts are involved, if a defect is found in the publication of the notice in the original proceeding, and a property owner challenges his assessment upon that ground, it would not be sufficient to give him a hearing as to the amount of his own assessment, but he could demand as a constitutional right a re-determination of the assessments of all others.\n This contention is inadmissible. It is true that all taxes and assessments are laid by some rule of apportionment. Where the scheme of distribution is palpably arbitrary and constitutes a plain abuse, it may be condemned as violative of the fundamental conceptions of justice embodied in the 14th Amendment. The principles involved in such cases have recently been discussed and need not be restated. Wagner v. Leser, \n239 U.S. 207\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66; Houck v.

Where assessments are made by a political subdivision, a taxing board, or court, according to special benefits, the property owner is entitled to be heard as to the amount of his assessment, and upon all questions properly entering into that determination. 'If the legislature,' as has frequently been stated, 'provides for notice to and hearing of each proprietor, at some stage of the proceedings, upon the question what proportion of the tax shall be assessed upon his land, there is no taking of his property without due process of law.' Spencer v. Merchant, \n125 \nU.S. 345, 355\n, 356 S., 31 L. ed. 763, 767, 768, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 921; Paulsen v. Portland, \n149 \nU.S. 30, 41\n, 37 S. L. ed. 637, 641, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 750; Bauman v. Ross, \n167 \nU.S. 548, 590\n, 42 S. L. ed. 270, 288, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 966; Goodrich v. Detroit, \n184 \nU.S. 432, 437\n, 438 S., 46 L. ed. 627, 630, 631, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397. What is meant by his 'proportion of the tax' is the amount which he should be required to pay, or with which his land should be charged. As was said in Fallbrook Irrig. Dist. v. Bradley, 164 U. S. p. 175, 41 L. ed. 394, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 56, when it is found that the land of an owner has been duly included within a benefit district, 'the right which he thereafter has is to a hearing upon the question of what is termed the apportionment of the tax, i. e., the amount of the tax which he is to pay.' See also French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. \n181 \nU.S. 324, 341\n, 45 S. L. ed. 879, 888, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625. It is a very different thing to say that an owner may demand as a constitutional privilege, not simply an inquiry as to the amount of the assessment with which his own property should rightly be charged in the light of all relevant facts, but that he should not be assessed at all unless the assessments of other owners who have paid without \n\n[241 U.S. 419, 431]\n\u00a0\n question and are not complaining shall be reopened and redetermined. The 14th Amendment affords no basis for a demand of that sort.\n The separate contention of the Union Depot Bridge Company is, as the state court said, virtually one of res judicata. It was insisted that, as a portion of its property was assessed in the original proceeding, and the assessment had been paid, it could not be assessed on other portions in the supplemental proceeding; that it must be concluded that the jury in the original proceeding had found that the other tracts were not benefited. The question whether the first judgment had this effect was a matter of state law; there is nothing in the Federal Constitution to prevent the assessment in the supplemental proceedings of properties omitted from the first proceeding. Phoenix F. & M. Ins. Co. v. Tennessee, supra. The 7th Amendment, invoked in this connection, has no application. Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Bombolis, decided May 22, 1916 [\n241 U.S. 211\n, 60 L. ed . --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595]. The company appeared in the supplemental proceeding and was heard, and, so far as any Federal question is concerned, does not appear to be in a different case from that of the other property owners.\n We find no error in the decision of the Federal questions and the judgment is affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 23 is as follows:\n'Sec. 23.

Thompson for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action for damages resulting, as was alleged, from unreasonable delay in transporting cattle from Fort \n\n[240 U.S. 240, 241]\n\u00a0\n Worth, Texas, to Kansas City, Missouri, in May, 1909. The plaintiff had a verdict and judgment, and the latter was affirmed. 40 Okla. 589, 139 Pac. 833. The errors assigned are that due effect was not given to certain provisions of the Carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act ( 7, chap. 3591, 34 Stat. at L. 584, 595, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563, 8592), or to the act limiting the time that cattle in interstate transit may be confined in cars without being unloaded for rest, water, and feed. Chap. 3594, 34 Stat. at L. 607, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8651\n\n\n The claim under the Carmack amendment was first set up and asserted in a petition for rehearing after the judgment in the trial court was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. The petition was not entertained, but was denied without passing upon the Federal question thus tardily raised. That question, therefore, is not open to consideration here. Pim v.

Rep. 510.\n The claim made under the other act was, that part of the delay was excusable, because the transportation reasonably could not have been completed within the maximum time-thirty-six hours-during which the cattle could be confined in the cars, and it therefore became necessary under the act to unload them for rest, water, and feed for at least five hours, as was done. Whether the transportation reasonably could have been completed within thirty-six hours was the subject of direct and conflicting testimony, and was committed to the jury as a question of fact. In that connection the court said to the jury: 'You are instructed that under the laws of the United States the defendant company could not keep the stock in this shipment in the cars longer than thirty-six hours, and if you find from the evidence that it was not reasonably possible that the shipment should reach Kansas City \n\n[240 U.S. 240, 242]\n\u00a0\n within the thirty-six-hour limit, then it is not liable for the delay caused by the unloading of the stock.' No exception was reserved to this instruction, no modification of it was suggested, and no other instruction upon the subject was requested It therefore is apparent that the assignments based upon this statute are so devoid of merit as to be frivolous.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","183":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nST LOUIS, I.

That no railroad company or corporation owning or operating any yards or terminals in the cities within this state, where switching, pushing or transferring of cars are made across public crossings within the city limits of the cities, shall operate their switch crew or crews with less than one engineer, a fireman, a foreman and three helpers.\n\n'Section 2. It being the purpose of this act to require all railroad companies or corporations who operate any yards or terminals within this state who do switching, pushing or transferring of cars across public crossings within the city limits of the cities to operate said switch crew or crews with not less than one engineer, a fireman, a foreman and three helpers, but nothing in this act shall be so construed as to prevent any railroad company or corporation \n\n[240 U.S. 518, 520]\n\u00a0\n from adding to or increasing their switch crew or crews beyond the number set out in this act.\n\n'Section 3. The provisions of this act shall only apply to cities of the first and second class, and shall not apply to railroad companies or corporations operating railroads less than 100 miles in length.\n\n'Section 4. Any railroad company or corporation violating the provisions of this act shall be fined for each separate offense not less than $50 and each crew so illegally operated shall constitute a separate offense.' [Acts 1913, pp. 211, 212.]\n\n The railroad company violated the terms of the statute for a day in the city of Hot Springs, and, being convicted thereof, was sentenced to pay the minimum fine imposed by the statute. The judgment which was entered upon the sentence was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. This writ of error was then granted.\n The railroad company contends that the statute violates (1) the due process and equality clauses of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, (2) that it operates as an interference with interstate commerce, and (3) prevents a contest of its validity by the excess of its penalties. Of the last ground it may be immediately said that it is without merit.\n The other grounds are in effect disposed of by prior decisions.\n In the case of Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Arkansas, \n219 U.S. 453\n, 55 L. ed. 290, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 275, a statute of Arkansas was considered which required freight trains to be equipped with crews consisting of an engineer, a foreman, a conductor, and three brakemen, 'regardless of any modern equipment or automatic couplings and air brakes. . . .' The statute did not apply to railroads whose line or lines did not exceed 50 miles in length, nor to any railroad, regardless of length of its line, where the freight train should consist of less than twenty-five cars. The statute was sustained on the authority of prior cases against charges of conflict \n\n[240 U.S. 518, 521]\n\u00a0\n with the 14th Amendment and the commerce clause of the Constitution. We need not cite the cases relied on or repeat the argument of the court. In that case, as in this, there was controversy in the testimony and the contentions of the parties as to the necessity of the statute. It was held, however, that the controversy did not establish that the statute was an arbitrary exercise of power. Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, this day decided [\n240 U.S. 510\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 440].\n A distinction is asserted between that case and this, and it is urged that the operation of freight trains of more than twenty-five cars on the trunk lines may require different provision than the movement of switching operations within terminals. But the basis of both is safety to the public, though the urgency in one may not be as great as the urgency in the other.\n A more serious objection is that certain terminal companies, one at the city of Helena and one at Fort Smith, do switching for certain connecting trunk lines, and yet, by reason of their length being less than 100 miles, are not covered by the act. Indeed, it is said that one of them, that at Fort Smith, does switching over some of the same crossings that plaintiff in error does. The distinction seems arbitrary if we regard only its letter, but there may have been considerations which determined it, and the record does not show the contrary. We have recognized the impossibility of legislation being all-comprehensive, and that there may be practical groupings of objects which will as a whole fairly present a class of itself, although there may be exceptions in which the evil aimed at is deemed not so flagrant.

C. Cruce, M. K. Cruce, W. I. Cruce, and L. S. Dolman for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Basing his cause of action upon the Federal employers' liability and safety appliance acts, Brown, the defendant in error, sued to recover damages resulting from injuries alleged to have been occasioned by the negligence of the railroad company while he was in its employ and engaged in interstate commerce. At the close of the testimony the claim under the safety appliance act was withdrawn and the case was submitted to the jury alone upon the employers' liability act. There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, which was affirmed by the court below. -- Okla. --, 144 Pac. 1075\n\n\n There was a sharp conflict between the testimony offered on behalf of the plaintiff and that on behalf of the defendant. The material facts disclosed by the plaintiff's testimony are as follows: Brown, a head brakeman, and other members of a local freight train crew on the day in question were engaged in the yards at Ashdown, Arkansas, in making up an extra freight train to be taken out by an extra crew to Hugo, Oklahoma. The cars intended \n\n[241 U.S. 223, 225]\n\u00a0\n for the interstate train were placed on an east and west passing track east of a switch connecting a spur track which ran in a northeasterly direction past a stave mill. After placing some cars from the spur track on the passing track, the engine returned to the spur track with several cars, some of which were to be left at the mill and the remainder brought out and coupled to those already collected for the train and standing on the passing track. Brown accompanied the cars, and, after cutting off those intended for the mill, gave the engineer a signal to go ahead, the engine being headed west, and when the cars approaching the switch came opposite the car on the passing track to which the coupling was to be made, Brown crossed over from the spur track to the passing track to adjust the coupler on the car standing there. Finding the knuckle of the coupler closed, he attempted to open it with the lever at the side of the car, but it did not work. He then tried to manipulate the knuckle with his hand, but could get it only part way open, and, closing it, he stepped out to the north side of the track (the engineer's side). As the last car coupled with the engine was then just clearing the switch, he gave the engineer a stop signal and walked west to the switch stand to set the switch so that the engine and cars might be backed to make the coupling. By the time he had walked the short intervening distance and set the switch the engine had come to a stop with the rear car a few steps west of the switch. Intending then to adjust the coupler on the end of this car, Brown gave the engineer, who was watching him, a 'spot' signal, which indicated that he was not to move the engine until a further signal was given by Brown, and crossed over to the south side of the track in order to use the lifting pin to open the knuckle of the coupler. When the lever failed to work he stepped behind the car and was about to try to open the knuckle with his hand when he heard the cars ahead of him move. He at once turned to leave the \n\n[241 U.S. 223, 226]\n\u00a0\n track, but was struck and knocked down by the car which was backed in disregard of the 'spot' signal, and his feet were caught under the wheels and crushed.\n The assignments of error are numerous, but those requiring to be specially noticed may be disposed of under three headings:\n\n 1. \nThe contention that rights of the railroad company guaranteed by the 7th Amendment were violated because only nine of the twelve jurors concurred in the verdict is without merit. Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Bombolis, \n241 U.S. 211\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595.\n\n 2. \nA twofold contention is based upon rulings concerning the doctrine of the assumption of the risk. Upon the withdrawal by the plaintiff of his claim under the safety appliance act, the court charged the jury concerning assumption of the risk as follows:\n'You are instructed that, by accepting employment as a brakeman with the defendant, the plaintiff assumed the risk of such dangers as are ordinarily incident to the occupation he was engaged in, and if you find that his injury was occasioned by one of the incidents ordinarily attending the occupation upon which he was engaged, you should return a verdict for the defendant; but you are instructed in this connection that the plaintiff only assumed the risks that are ordinarily incident to the occupation in which he was engaged, and that he did not assume the risks that were attendant upon the negligence of a fellow servant.'\n\n\n (a)\n It is insisted that the abandonment of the claim as to a violation of the safety appliance act necessarily withdrew all evidence tending to show that the couplers were defective, and, in the absence of such evidence, the proof established as a matter of law that the plaintiff assumed the risk, and the court should have directed a verdict in favor of the railroad. We think the proposition is plainly without merit. The testimony concerning \n\n[241 U.S. 223, 227]\n\u00a0\n the condition of the couplers was clearly admissible under the issues based on the employers' liability act as explaining the occasion for Brown's being on the track, and as negativing negligence on his part. In so far as the contention implies that the withdrawal of the claim was a concession that the testimony relating to the couplers was false, we think the conclusion is wholly unwarranted. If we were to conjecture as to the reason for the abandonment of the claim under the safety appliance act, we think it at least quite as probable that plaintiff's counsel were of opinion that, in the situation disclosed by the plaintiff's testimony, the safety appliance act was inapplicable.\n\n\n (b)\n In the court below it would seem that the correctness of the general instruction as to assumption of the risk which we have quoted as given by the trial court was challenged on a ground which has been abandoned because not here pressed. But it is said reversible error exists because the court below, in passing upon such objection, remarked that as the 'defendant's liability to plaintiff grows out of a violation of a statutory duty, arising under an act of Congress,' assumption of the risk was not a defense. This, it is said, was erroneous, first, because so far as the safety appliance act was concerned, it was inapposite, as reliance upon that law by the plaintiff had been disclaimed, and second, because, under the facts, it was open to find the existence of assumption of the risk depending upon conditions of fact not involved in the safety appliance act. But we fail to see the pertinency of this objection, as there is now no contention concerning the correctness of the charge as to assumption of the risk upon which the case was submitted to the jury for their verdict. At best, therefore, the error asserted simply amounts to contending that because the court below may have inaccurately expressed in one respect its reasons for affirmance, that inaccuracy gives rise to the duty of \n\n[241 U.S. 223, 228]\n\u00a0\n reversing the judgment although no reversible error exists\n\n 3. \nIt is contended that the court erred in charging the jury that, in the event they found the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence, they should 'reduce his damages in proportion to the amount of negligence which is attributable to him,' since the court did not define the word 'proportion,' and hence failed to fix any standard by which the damages should be measured. The charge is clearly distinguishable from the instruction disapproved in Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Tilghman, \n237 U.S. 499\n, 59 L. ed. 1069, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 653, which is relied upon, since in that case the jury were in effect instructed to diminish the damages according to their conception of what was reasonable. The instruction given is almost in the identical language of the statute, and while definition might have further conduced to an appreciation by the jury of the standard established by the statute, we think there was no error in the charge given, especially as the railroad company made no request for a charge clarifying any obscurity on the subject which it deemed existed. It is true to company made a request on the subject which the court declined to give, but that request, we are of opinion, taken as a whole, instead of clarifying any ambiguity deemed to exist in the instruction which the court gave would have served to obscure it. There was no error, therefore, leaving aside the question whether the requested instruction did not contain matters which, if given, would have been erroneous.\n Although we have examined the whole record, and, as the result of that examination, conclude there is no ground for reversal, we have not particularly noticed subjects embraced by some of the assignments, but not pressed in argument, and others not embraced by the assignments, but indirectly referred to in the argument.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","185":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTANTON v.

Van Derlip filed a brief as amicus curioe.[ Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co \n240 U.S. 103\n (1916) ]\n\n\n[240 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n As in Brushaber v. Union P. R. Co. \n240 U.S. 1\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 236, this case was commenced by the appellant as a stockholder of the Baltic Mining Company, the appellee, to enjoin the voluntary payment by the corporation and its officers of the tax assessed against it under the income tax section of the tariff act of October 3, 1913 (38 Stat. at L. 166, 181, chap. 16). As to the grounds for the equitable relief \n\n[240 U.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n sought in this case so far as the question of jurisdiction is concerned are substantially the same as those which were relied upon in the Brushaber Case, it follows that the ruling in that case upholding the power to dispose of that controversy is controlling here, and we put that subject out of view.\n Further, also, like the Brushaber Case, this is before us on a direct appeal prosecuted for the purpose of reviewing the action of the court below in dismissing on motion the bill for want of equity.\n The bill averred: 'That, under and by virtue of the alleged authority contained in said income tax law, if valid and constitutional, the respondent company is taxable at the rate of 1 per cent upon its gross receipts from all sources, during the calendar year ending December 31, 1914, after deducting (1) its ordinary and necessary expenses paid within the year in the maintenance and operation of its business and properties, and (2) all losses actually sustained within the year, and not compensated by insurance or otherwise, including depreciation arising from depletion of its ore deposits to the limited extent of 5 per cent of the 'gross value at the mine of the output' during said year.' It was further alleged that the company would, if not restrained, make a return for taxation conformably to the statute, and would pay the tax upon the basis stated without protest, and that to do so would result in depriving the complainant as a stockholder of rights secured by the Constitution of the United States, as the tax which it was proposed to pay without protest was void for repugnancy to that Constitution. The bill contained many averments on the following subjects, which may be divided into two generic classes: (A) Those concerning the operation of the law in question upon individuals generally and upon other than mining corporations, and the discrimination against mining corporations which arose in favor of such other corporations and individuals \n\n[240 U.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n by the legislation, as well as discrimination which the provisions of the act operated against mining corporations because of the separate and more unfavorable burden cast upon them by the statute than was placed upon other corporations and individuals,-averments all of which were obviously made to support the subsequent charges which the bill contained as to the repugnancy of the law imposing the tax to the equal protection, due process, and uniformity clauses of the Constitution. And (B) those dealing with the practical results on the company of the operation of the tax in question, evidently alleged for the purpose of sustaining the charge which the bill made that the tax levied was not what was deemed to be the peculiar direct tax which the 16th Amendment exceptionally authorized to be levied without apportionment, and of the resulting repugnancy of the tax to the Constitution as a direct tax on property because of its ownership, levied without conforming to the regulation of apportionment generally required by the Constitution as to such taxation.\n We need not more particularly state the averments as to the various contentions in class (a), as their character will necessarily be made manifest by the statement of the legal propositions based on them which we shall hereafter have occasion to make. As to the averments concerning class (B), it suffices to say that it resulted from copious allegations in the bill as to the value of the ore body contained in the mine which the company worked, and the total output for the year of the product of the mine after deducting the expenses as previously stated; that the 5 per cent deduction permitted by the statute was inadequate to allow for the depletion of the ore body, and therefore the law to a large extent taxed not the mere profit arising from the operation of the mine, but taxed as income the yearly product which represented to a large extent the yearly depletion or exhaustion of \n\n[240 U.S. 103, 110]\n\u00a0\n the ore body from which, during the year, ore was taken. Indeed, the following alleged facts concerning the relation which the annual production bore to the exhaustion or diminution of the property in the ore bed must be taken as true for the purpose of reviewing the judgment sustaining the motion to dimiss the bill.\n'That the real or actual yearly income derived by the respondent company from its business or property does not exceed $550,000. That, under the income tax, the said company is held taxable, in an average year, to the amount of approximately $1,150,000, the same being ascertained by deducting from its net receipts of $1,400,000 only a depreciation of $100, 000 on its plant and a depletion of its ore supply limited by law to 5 per cent of the value of its annual gross receipts, and amounting to $150,000; whereas, in order properly to ascertain its actual income, $750,000 per annum should be allowed to be deducted for such depletion, or five times the amount actually allowed.'\n\n Without attempting minutely to state every possible ground of attack which might be deduced from the averments of the bill, but in substance embracing every material grievance therein asserted and pressed in argument upon our attention in the elaborate briefs which have been submitted, we come to separately dispose of the legal propositions advanced in the bill and arguments concerning the two classes.\n Class A. Under this the bill charged that the provisions of the statute 'are unconstitutional and void under the 5th Amendment, in that they deny to mining companies and their stockholders equal protection of the laws and deprive them of their property without due process of law,' for the following reasons:\n\n\n (1)\n Because all other individuals or corporations were given a right to deduct a fair and reasonable percentage for losses and depreciation of their capital, and they were \n\n[240 U.S. 103, 111]\n\u00a0\n therefore not confined to the arbitrary 5 per cent fixed as the basis for deductions by mining corporations.\n\n\n (2)\n Because by reason of the differences in the allowances which the statute permitted, the tax levied was virtually a net income tax on other corporations and individuals, and a gross income tax on mining corporations.\n\n\n (3)\n Because the statute established a discriminating rule as to individuals and other corporations as against mining corporations on the subject of the method of the allowance for depreciations.\n\n\n (4)\n Because the law permitted all individuals to deduct from their net income dividends received from corporations which had paid the tax on their incomes, and did not give the right to corporations to make such deductions from their income of dividends received from other corporations which had paid their income tax. This was illustrated by the averment that 99 per cent of the stock of the defendant company was owned by a holding company, and that under the statute not only was the corporation obliged to pay the tax on its income, but so also was the holding company obliged to pay on the dividends paid it by the defendant company.\n\n\n (5)\n Because of the discrimination resulting from the provision of the statute providing for a progressive increase of taxation or surtax as to individuals, and not as to corporations.\n\n\n (6)\n Because of the exemptions which the statute made of individual incomes below $4,000, and of incomes of labor organizations and various other exemptions which were set forth.\n But it is apparent from the mere statement of these contentions that each and all of them were adversely disposed of by the decision in the Brushaber Case, and they all therefore may be put out of view.\n Class B. Under this class these propositions are relied upon: \n\n[240 U.S. 103, 112]\n\u00a0\n (1) That as the 16th Amendment authorizes only an exceptional direct income tax without apportionment, to which the tax in question does not conform, it is therefore not within the authority of that Amendment.\n\n\n (2)\n Not being within the authority of the 16th Amendment, the tax is therefore, within the ruling of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. \n157 U.S. 429\n, 39 L. ed. 759, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673; \n158 U.S. 601\n, 39 L. ed. 1108, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 912, a direct tax and void for want of compliance with the regulation of apportionment.\n As the first proposition is plainly in conflict with the meaning of the 16th Amendment as interpreted in the Brushaber Case, it may also be put out of view. As to the second, while indeed it is distinct from the subjects considered in the Brushaber Case to the extent that the particular tax which the statute levies on mining corporations here under consideration is distinct from the tax on corporations other than mining and on individuals, which was disposed of in the Brushaber Case, a brief analysis will serve to demonstrate that the distinction is one without a difference, and therefore that the proposition is also foreclosed by the previous ruling. The contention is that as the tax here imposed is not on the net product, but in a sense somewhat equivalent to a tax on the gross product of the working of the mine by the corporation, therefore the tax is not within the purview of the 16th Amendment, and consequently it must be treated as a direct tax on property because of its ownership, and as such void for want of apportionment. But, aside from the obvious error of the proposition, intrinsically considered, it manifestly disregards the fact that by the previous ruling it was settled that the provisions of the 16th Amendment conferred no new power of taxation, but simply prohibited the previous complete and plenary power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning from being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to which it inherently belonged, and being placed \n\n[240 U.S. 103, 113]\n\u00a0\n in the category of direct taxation subject to apportionment by a consideration of the sources from which the income was derived,-that is, by testing the tax not by what it was, a tax on income, but by a mistaken theory deduced from the origin or source of the income taxed. Mark, of course, in saying this we are not here considering a tax not within the provisions of the 16th Amendment, that is, one in which the regulation of apportionment or the rule of uniformity is wholly negligible because the tax is one entirely beyond the scope of the taxing power of Congress, and where consequently sequently no authority to impose a burden, either direct or indirect, exists. In other words, we are here dealing solely with the restriction imposed by the 16th Amendment on the right to resort to the source whence an income is derived in a case where there is power to tax for the purpose of taking the income tax out of the class of indirect, to which it generically belongs, and putting it in the class of direct, to which it would not otherwise belong, in order to subject it to the regulation of apportionment. But it is said that although this be undoubtedly true as a general rule, the peculiarity of mining property and the exhaustion of the ore body which must result from working the mine cause the tax in a case like this, where an inadequate allowance by way of deduction is made for the exhaustion of the ore body, to be in the nature of things a tax on property because of its ownership, and therefore subject to apportionment. Not to so hold, it is urged, is as to mining property but to say that mere form controls, thus rendering in substance the command of the Constitution that taxation directly on property because of its ownership be apportioned, wholly illusory or futile. But this merely asserts a right to take the taxation of mining corporations out of the rule established by the 16th Amendment when there is no authority for so doing. It moreover rests upon the wholly fallacious \n\n[240 U.S. 103, 114]\n\u00a0\n assumption that, looked at from the point of view of substance, a tax on the product of a mine is necessarily in its essence and nature in every case a direct tax on property because of its ownership, unless adequate allowance be made for the exhaustion of the ore body to result from working the mine. We say wholly fallacious assumption because, independently of the effect of the operation of the 16th Amendment, it was settled in Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 U.S. 399\n, 58 L. ed. 285, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 136, that such tax is not a tax upon property as such because of its ownership, but a true excise levied on the results of the business of carrying on mining operations. (pp. 413 et seq.)\n As it follows from what we have said that the contentions are in substance and effect controlled by the Brushaber Case, and, in so for as this may not be the case, are without merit, it results that, for the reasons stated in the opinion in that case and those expressed in this, the judgment must be and it is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF GEORGIA v.

Allen, W. T. Alden, Ernest E. Watson, and Herbert A. Abernethy as amici curioe.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n A preliminary outline is essential to clear the way for an understanding of the case. By original action here brought, the state sues to tecover a sum of money for passenger fares in excess of the rate established by law, paid by its officers when traveling within the state, on state business. Answering, the railroad alleges among other defenses that the rates fixed by law were so low as to be confiscatory, and hence repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. The matter for decision arises on a motion on behalf of the state to strike out this defense on the ground that the right to assert it is barred by a decree of this court, establishing that the rates fixed by the state law were lawful, and not confiscatory,-a decree the conclusive effect of which, it is asserted, the railroad company is estopped from denying.\n The case as made by the pleadings and by the record in which the decree relied on was rendered, of which we take judicial notice, is this: In April, 1905, by law, Missouri established certain freight rates. Almost at once the defendant company and others filed their bills in \n\n[241 U.S. 533, 537]\n\u00a0\n the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Missouri against the State Board of Warehouse Commissioners, the attorney general of the state, and certain shippers, alleged to be representative, to enjoin the carrying out of the rate-fixing law on the ground that to enforce the rates which it fixed would result in confiscation and a taking of the property of the railroads in violation of the Constitution. An injunction was granted prohibiting the carrying into effect of the rate law. While these suits were pending, the state by law fixed a passenger rate, and, repealing the freight law which had been enjoined, enacted another, and by supplemental bills both these laws were assailed on the grounds upon which the other law had been attacked, and injunctions were awarded restraining their enforcement. After much testimony offered on the issue of confiscation, the court permanently enjoined the enforcement of the state statutes. On review in this court, as to the railroad now before us and others, this conclusion was held to be erroneous, and the decree which was entered here reversed and remanded the case, with directions to dismiss the bill, without prejudice.

Rep. 975.\n Although the contentions respectively pressed in argument are numerous, their solution depends upon the application of a few well-settle principles which we proceed to state in order to test all the propositions by applying them, and thus avoid redundancy.\n\n 1. \nIn Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 U.S. 418\n, 33 L. ed. 970, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 209, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 462, 702, considering a law fixing railroad rates in the light of two settled rules, (a) that, in exerting the public rate-making power, the rates cannot be made so low as to be confiscatory, without violating the Constitution, and (b) that although a state is not subject to suit without its consent, there is always the right to enjoin an individual, whether he is a state officer or not, from doing an act violating the Constitution, that is, from taking property \n\n[241 U.S. 533, 538]\n\u00a0\n unlawfully, it was held that both these propositions controlled in the fullest degree in the legislative fixing of railroad rates. In fact it was in that case decided that from the act of fixing railroad rates by law there resulted the duty to provide an opportunity for testing their repugnancy as a unit to the Constitution in case there was a charge that they were confiscatory. It was accordingly held that, in virtue of the due process of law provision of the 14th Amendment, the state could not by mandamus compel a railroad to comply with rates fixed by a state law unless an opportunity was afforded to test the question of confiscation.\n Developing and applying this doctrine in many cases, it came to pass that on the complaint of a railroad as to the confiscatory character of rates fixed by state law, the right was recognized to test the rates as a unit, and therefore to obtain an injunction restraining the enforcement of the state law in its entirety; and that for such purpose any officers of the state having any power to directly enforce the law, or, by indirection, to give effect to the same in any manner whatever, were qualified as defendants to stand in judgment for the relief asked.

Rep. 418; Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 52 L. ed. 714, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441, 14 Ann. Cas. 764; Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co. \n212 U.S. 19\n, 53 L. ed. 382, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1134, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034; Minnesota Rate Cases (Simpson v. Shepard) \n230 U.S. 352\n, 57 L. ed. 1511, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 729, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; Missouri Rate Cases (Knott v. Chicago, B. & Q. R.

Rep. 437.\n\n 2. \nWhile it is true that the comprehensive right thus recognized was broader and more efficacious than would be the right of a railroad merely to resist in each particular case an individual effort to enforce a single rate fixed by law (see Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 52 L. ed. 714, 13 L. R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441, 14 Ann. Cas. 764), it is true also that the recognized broader right was not, unless it was availed of, exclusive of the latter and narrower one, that is, the right to resist separate attempts to enforce a rate. St Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. Gill, \n156 U.S. 649\n, 39 L. ed. 567, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 484. This \n\n[241 U.S. 533, 539]\n\u00a0\n principle was but a recognition of the fact that the broader right to invoke a complete remedy to enjoin the law, and thus prevent the enforcement of the rates, did not take away the narrower right of a railroad to stand upon the defensive, and merely resist the attempt to enforce the rate in each particular case, because of their confiscatory character. One right was not destructive of the other, because there was freedom to elect which of the two would be pursued.\n\n 3. \nResulting from the principles just stated, recognizing that the operation of a decree enjoining the giving effect to a rate law, because of its alleged confiscatory character, differed materially, both as to the public interest and that of the railroad, from the consequences which would arise from a mere decree rejecting the complaint of a person as to an individual and consummated grievance, based on the claim that an illegal rate had been charged, it came to pass that a form of decree came to be applied in rate cases to meet and provide for this difference. In other words, in a rate case where an assertion of confiscation was not upheld, because of the weakness of the facts supporting it, the practice came to be that the decree rejecting the claim and giving effect to the statute was, where it was deemed the situation justified it, qualified as 'without prejudice,' not to leave open the controversy as to the period with which the decree dealt, and which it concluded, but in order not to prejudice rights of property in the future, if, from future operation and changed conditions arising in such future, it resulted that there was confiscation. And the same limitation arising from a solicitude not to unduly restrain in the future the operation of the law came to be applied where the asserted confiscation was held to be established. In other words, the decree enjoining the enforcement of the statute in that case was also qualified as without prejudice to the enforcement of the statute in the future if a change in \n\n[241 U.S. 533, 540]\n\u00a0\n conditions arose. The doctrine in the first aspect nowhere finds a more lucid statement than the one made on behalf of the court by Mr. Justice Moody in Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co. \n212 U.S. 1\n, 53 L. ed. 371, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148. It has since been repeatedly applied in language which, in the completest way, makes the meaning of the limitation 'without prejudice' in such a case clear, and leaves no ground for any dispute whatever on the subject. Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co. \n212 U.S. 19\n, 53 L. ed. 382, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1134, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034; Northern P. R. Co. v. North Dakota, \n216 U.S. 579\n, 54 L. ed. 624, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 423; Louisville v. Cumberland Teleph. & Teleg. Co. \n225 U.S. 430\n, 56 L. ed. 1151, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 741; Missouri Rate Cases (Knott v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co.) \n230 U.S. 474\n, 57 L. ed. 1571, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 975; Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 U.S. 153\n, 59 L. ed. 1244, P.U. R.1915D, 577, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 811. A complete illustration of the operation of the qualification is afforded by the North Dakota Case, just cited, since in that case, as a result of the qualification 'without prejudice,' the case was subsequently reopened, and upon a consideration of new conditions arising in such future period, a different result followed from that which had been previously reached. \n236 U.S. 585\n, 59 L. ed. 735, L.R.A. --, --, P.U.R.1915C, 277, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 429, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1. As to the second aspect, that is, the significance of the limitation 'without prejudice' as applied to a decree which enjoined the rates as confiscatory, the meaning of the reservation as we have stated it was in express terms, through an abundance of precaution, defined and stated in the opinion in the Missouri Rate Cases (Knott v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co.) \n230 \nU.S. 474, 508\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1571, 1594, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 975.\n Let us test the merit of the respective contentions by these propositions.\n\n\n (a)\n It is insisted that the right obtains to assert, as against the individual suit of the state, the existence of the confiscation for the very period covered by the previous finding that there was a failure to establish the confiscation, because the reservation 'without prejudice,' which was made in that decree, leaves the whole subject open for a renewed attack as to individuals, and, indeed, by general complaint as to the unconstitutionality of the law as a whole. But this proposition simply disregards the founda- \n\n[241 U.S. 533, 541]\n\u00a0\n tion upon which such a reservation came to be applied, as we have just pointed out, in cases involving an assault upon the present and future operation of a law fixing rates. In other words, the contention but accepts the doctrine previously announced, and yet repudiates the cases by which that doctrine was established, by affixing a meaning to the reservation 'without prejudice,' as used in the cases, wholly destructive of the sole object and purpose for which, in those cases, the reservation came to be applied. Again, it is said, conceding that the limitation 'without prejudice,' when applied to a rate case, under the authorities, has the significance which we have affixed to it, that meaning should only prevent the reopening of the inquiry as to the period embraced by the testimony in the case, and therefore should not be extended so as to prevent the reopening from the time, at least, of the close of the testimony. This, it is said, must be the case, since there might well be a change in conditions between the time when the proof in a case was taken and the entry of the final decree. But this contention again disregards the doctrine upon which, as we have pointed out, the reservation in rate- making cases came to be applied. In other words, it treats the reservation 'without prejudice' as looking backward, and overthrowing that which was concluded by the decree, instead of considering it in its true light, that is, as looking forward to the future, and providing for conditions which might then arise.\n\n\n (b)\n Conceding, for the argument's sake, the controlling influence of what we have said, nevertheless the contention is that the previous decree is here inapplicable, since the state was not a party to the litigation in which the decree was entered; indeed, could not have been made a party without its consent. But once more the argument proceeds upon a disregard of the previous cases, upon the authority of which the right was exercised to obtain, on the charge of confiscation, the exertion of judicial aut- \n\n[241 U.S. 533, 542]\n\u00a0\n hority to stay or suspend every vestige of power asserted by the state statute fixing rates until the controversy was determined. In other words, the proposition ignores the doctrine settled by the previous cases that there inhered in, and went along with, the rate-making power, a duty on the part of the state to afford means for judicially deciding a question of confiscation when asserted. It is true, as we have previously pointed out, that because there was a right on the part of a railroad to sue to prevent the execution of the state power manifested in the rate-making law, it did not follow that the railroad was deprived of its right to resist the enforcement of the law by way of defense when an attempt was made to enforce the law against it. But it is true also, as we have seen, that the right to elect between the two was undoubted,-an election the potency of which was pointed out in the Gill Case, supra, and was, moreover, in the clearest way, fully expounded in the Young Case, 209 U. S. p. 166, 52 L. ed. 731, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441, 14 Ann. Cas. 764. This being true, it is obvious that the question here is not how far the decree relied upon was binding upon parties who were not technical defendants, but how far is it binding upon the railroad? In other words, it is whether, when there has been an election to obtain a remedy by proceedings against particular defendants, comprehensive enough to restrain the giving effect of every vestige of state power which was embraced in the authority exerted by the state in passing the rate-making law, it can now be said by the railroad, in order to frustrate or limit the decree rendered in the case, that the restraint did not operate as against the rate-making power so far as the interest of the state is concerned, because the state was not a party. The right to restrain the whole power having been enjoyed for the purpose of the complaint as to confiscation which was made, the contrary cannot be asserted in order to escape the effect of the decree, holding that such complaint was erroneously made. In last analysis, \n\n[241 U.S. 533, 543]\n\u00a0\n the contention comes simply to asserting that the settled rule of Ex parte Young and the cases, which preceded it was wrong, and there was no right to restrain the complete enforcement of the rate law without the presence of the state as a technical party. And the cogency of this consideration is made quite clear by bearing in mind, as expressly pointed out in the Young Case, supra, that the power which the court possessed by virtue of the bringing of the suit at the instance of the railroad to enjoin and suspend the whole rate-making law comprehensively included the right to stay proceedings brought in other courts, which would have tended to set aside or frustrate the authority to completely exercise the jurisdiction acquired.\n As it results from what we have said that, in our opinion, by the application of the most elementary principles of estoppel, the railroad may not be heard to disavow what it asserted in order to secure the suspension of the rate law during the suit, it follows that it was without right in this case to assert the defense of confiscation, and the motion to strike out the same must therefore prevail.\n As the view which we have taken of the controversy has not rendered it necessary to consider whether, in any event, the suit was not a class suit binding upon all, into that subject we have not entered. Additionally, we have not considered, and express no opinion upon, the arguments dealing with questions of the ultimate right to recover in the absence of a condition to that effect imposed when the injunction was issued, in view of the terms of the injunction bond, etc., etc.\n The motion to strike out the defense of confiscation from the answer is granted.\n Mr. Justice McKenna dissents. \n\n\n\n","188":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF N.C. v.

HILDEBRANT(1916)\nNo. 987\nArgued: Decided: June 12, 1916\n\n\n\n Messrs. Sherman T. McPherson and J. Warren Keifer for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Edward C. Turner, Attorney General of Ohio, and Messrs. Edmond H. Moore and Timothy S. Hogan for defendants in error. \n\n[241 U.S. 565, 566]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n By an amendment to the Constitution of Ohio, adopted September 3d, 1912, the legislative power was expressly declared to be vested not only in the senate and house of representatives of the state, constituting the general assembly, but in the people, in whom a right was reserved by way of referendum to approve or disapprove by popular vote any law enacted by the general assembly. And by other constitutional provisions the machinery to carry out the referendum was created. Briefly they were this: Within a certain time after the enactment of a law by the senate and house of representatives, and its approval by the governor, upon petition of 6 per centum of the voters, the question of whether the law should become operative was to be submitted to a vote of the people, and, if approved, the law should be operative; and, if not approved, it should have no effect whatever.\n In May, 1915, the general assembly of Ohio passed an act redistricting the state for the purpose of congressional elections, by which act twenty-two congressional districts were created, in some respects differing from the previously established districts, and this act, after approval by the governor, was filed in the office of the secretary of state. The requisite number of electors under the referendum provision having petitioned for a submission of the law to a popular vote, such vote was taken and the law was disapproved. Thereupon, in the supreme court of the state, the suit before us was begun against state election officers for the purpose of procuring a mandamus, directing them to disregard the vote of the people on the referendum, disapproving the law, and to proceed to discharge their duties as such officers in the next congressional election, upon the assumption that the action by way of referendum was void, and that the law which was disapproved was \n\n[241 U.S. 565, 567]\n\u00a0\n subsisting and valid. The right to this relief was based upon the charge that the referendum vote was not and could not be a part of the legislative authority of the state, and therefore could have no influence on the subject of the law creating congressional districts for the purpose of representation in Congress. Indeed, it was in substance charged that both from the point of view of the state Constitution and laws and from that of the Constitution of the United States, especially  4 of article 1, providing that 'the times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing Senators;' and also from that of the provisions of the controlling act of Congress of August 8, 1911 (chap. 5, 37 Stat. at L. 13, Comp. Stat. 1913,  15), apportioning representation among the states, the attempt to make the referendum a component part of the legislative authority empowered to deal with the election of members of Congress was absolutely void. The court below adversely disposed of these contentions, and held that the provisions as to referendum were a part of the legislative power of the state, made so by the Constitution, and that nothing in the act of Congress of 1911, or in the constitutional provision, operated to the contrary, and that therefore the disapproved law had no existence and was not entitled to be enforced by mandamus.\n Without going into the many irrelevant points which are pressed in the argument, and the various inapposite authorities cited, although we have considered them all, we think it is apparent that the whole case and every real question in it will be disposed of by looking at it from three points of view,-the state power, the power of Congress, and the operation of the provision of the Constitution of the United States, referred to.\n\n 1. \nAs to the state power, we pass from its consideration, \n\n[241 U.S. 565, 568]\n\u00a0\n since it is obvious that the decision below is conclusive on that subject, and makes it clear that, so far as the state had the power to do it, the referendum constituted a part of the state Constitution and laws, and was contained within the legislative power; and therefore the claim that the law which was disapproved and was no law under the Constitution and laws of the state was yet valid and operative is conclusively established to be wanting in merit.\n\n 2. \nSo far as the subject may be influenced by the power of Congress, that is, to the extent that the will of Congress has been expressed on the subject, we think the case is equally without merit. We say this because we think it is clear that Congress, in 1911, in enacting the controlling law concerning the duties of the states, through their legislative authority, to deal with the subject of the creation of congressional districts, expressly modified the phraseology of the previous acts relating to that subject by inserting a clause plainly intended to provide that where, by the state Constitution and laws, the referendum was treated as part of the legislative power, the power as thus constituted should be held and treated to be the state legislative power for the purpose of creating congressional districts by law. This is the case since, under the act of Congress dealing with apportionment, which preceded the act of 1911, by  4 if was commanded that the existing districts in a state should continue in force 'until the legislature of such state, in the manner herein prescribed, shall redistrict such state' (act of February 7, 1891, chap. 116, 26 Stat. at L. 735); while in the act of 1911 there was substituted a provision that the redistricting should be made by a state 'in the manner provided by the laws thereof.' And the legislative history of this last act leaves no room for doubt that the prior words were stricken out and the new words inserted for the express purpose, in so far as Congress had power to do \n\n[241 U.S. 565, 569]\n\u00a0\n it, of excluding the possibility of making the contention as to referendum which is now urged. Cong. Rec. vol. 47, pp. 3436, 3437, 3507\n\n\n 3. To the extent that the contention urges that to include the referendum within state legislative power for the purpose of apportionment is repugnant to  4 of article 1 of the Constitution and hence void, even if sanctioned by Congress, because beyond the constitutional authority of that body, and hence that it is the duty of the judicial power so to declare, we again think the contention is plainly without substance, for the following reasons: It must rest upon the assumption that to include the referendum in the scope of the legislative power is to introduce a virus which destroys that power, which in effect annihilates representative government, and causes a state where such condition exists to be not republican in form, in violation of the guaranty of the Constitution. Const.  4, art. 4. But the proposition and the argument disregard the settled rule that the question of whether that guaranty of the Constitution has been disregarded presents no justiciable controversy, but involves the exercise by Congress of the authority vested in it by the Constitution. Pacific States Teleph. & Teleg. Co. v. Oregon, \n223 U.S. 118\n, 56 L. ed. 377, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224. In so far as the proposition challenges the power of Congress, as manifested by the clause in the act of 1911, treating the referendum as a part of the legislative power for the purpose of apportionment, where so ordained by the state Constitutions and laws, the argument but asserts, on the one hand, that Congress had no power to do that which, from the point of view of  4 of article 1, previously considered, the Constitution expressly gave the right to do. In so far as the proposition may be considered as asserting, on the other hand, that any attempt by Congress to recognize the referendum as a part of the legislative authority of a state is obnoxious to a republican form of government as provided by  4 of \n\n[241 U.S. 565, 570]\n\u00a0\n article 4, the contention necessarily but reasserts the proposition on that subject previously adversely disposed of. And that this is the inevitable result of the contention is plainly manifest, since at best the proposition comes to the assertion that because Congress, upon whom the Constitution has conferred the exclusive authority to uphold the guaranty of a republican form of government, has done something which it is deemed is repugnant to that guaranty, therefore there was automatically created judicial authority to go beyond the limits of judicial power, and, in doing so, to usurp congressional power, on the ground that Congress had mistakenly dealt with a subject which was within its exclusive control, free from judicial interference.\n It is apparent from these reasons that there must either be a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, because there is no power to re- examine the state questions foreclosed by the decision below, and because of the want of merit in the Federal questions relied upon, or a judgment of affirmance, it being absolutely indifferent, as to the result, which of the two be applied. In view, however, of the subject-matter of the controversy and the Federal characteristics which inhere in it, we are of opinion, applying the rule laid down in Swafford v. Templeton, \n185 U.S. 487\n, 46 L. ed. 1005, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 783, the decree proper to be rendered is one of affirmance, and such a decree is therefore ordered.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","190":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTEWART v. RAMSAY(1916)\nNo. 105\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n Mr. Robert C. Fergus for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Clarence S. Darrow for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n Stewart brought an action at law against Ramsay in the United States district court for the northern district of Illinois, and the summons was served personally upon defendant in that district. The jurisdiction was invoked on the ground that plaintiff was a citizen of Illinois and a resident of the northern district, and defendant was a citizen and resident of Colorado. Ramsay pleaded in abatement that he was a resident of the state of Colorado and was served with process while in attendance upon the district court as a witness in a case wherein he was plaintiff and one Anderson defendant, and that the process was served while he was returning from the courtroom after testifying. Upon plaintiff's demurrer this plea was sustained, and, plaintiff electing to stand upon his demurrer, it was ordered that the writ be quashed and \n\n[242 U.S. 128, 129]\n\u00a0\n the defendant go without day. The present writ of error was sued out under  238, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1215], the jurisdictional question being certified.\n That a direct writ of error lies in such a case is well settled. G. & C. Merriam Co. v. Saalfield, \n241 \nU.S. 22, 26\n, 60 S. L. ed. 868, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 477.\n In our opinion, the decision of the district court was correct. The true rule, well founded in reason and sustained by the greater weight of authority, is that suitors, greater weight of authority, is that suitors, as well as witnesses, coming from another state or jurisdiction, are exempt from the service of civil process while in attendance upon court, and during a reasonable time in coming and going. A leading authority in the state courts is Halsey v. Stewart, 4 N. J. L. 366, decided in the New Jersey supreme court nearly one hundred years ago, upon the following reasoning: 'Courts of justice ought everywhere to be open, accessible, free from interruption, and to cast a perfect protection around every man who necessarily approaches them. The citizen in every claim of right which he exhibits, and every defense which he is obliged to make, should be permitted to approach them, not only without subjecting himself to evil, but even free from the fear of molestation or hindrance. He should also be enabled to procure, without difficulty, the attendance of all such persons as are necessary to manifest his rights. Now, this great object in the administration of justice would in a variety of ways be obstructed if parties and witnesses were liable to be served with process while actually attending the court. It is often matter of great importance to the citizen, to prevent the institution and prosecution of a suit in any court, at a distance from his home and his means of defense; and the fear that a suit may be commenced there by summons will as effectually prevent his approach as if a capias might be served upon him. This is especially the case with citizens of neighboring states, to whom the power which the court possesses of compelling attendance cannot reach.' \n\n[242 U.S. 128, 130]\n\u00a0\n The state courts, with few exceptions, have followed this rule, applying it to plaintiffs as well as defendants, and to witnesses attending voluntarily as well as those under subpoena. Illustrative cases may be cited: Richardson v. Smith, 74 N. J. L. 111, 114, 65 Atl. 162; Matthews v. Tufts, 87 N. Y. 568; Mitchell v. Huron Circuit Judge, 53 Mich. 541, 19 N. W. 176; Andrews v.

But in Parker v. Hotchkiss (1849) 1 Wall. Jr. 269, Fed. Cas. No. 10,739, District Judge Kane, with the concurrence, as he states, of Chief Justice Taney and Mr. Justice Grier, overruled Blight v. Fisher, and sustained the privilege in favor of a nonresident admitted to make defense in a pending suit, and served with summons while attending court for that purpose, the court declaring: 'The privilege which is asserted here is the privilege of the court, rather than of the defendant. It is founded in the necessities of the judicial administration, which would be often embarrassed, and sometimes interrupted, if the suitor might be vexed with process while attending upon the court for the protection of his rights, or the witness while attending to testify. Witnesses would be chary of coming within our jurisdiction, and would be exposed \n\n[242 U.S. 128, 131]\n\u00a0\n to dangerous influences, if they might be punished with a lawsuit for displeasing parties by their testimony; and even parties in interest, whether on the record or not, might be deterred from the rightfully fearless assertion of a claim or the rightfully fearless assertion of a defense, if they were liable to be visited on the instant with writs from the defeated party.' Since this decision, the Federal circuit and district courts have consistently sustained the privilege. Juneau Bank v. McSpedan, 5 Biss. 64, Fed. Cas. No. 7,582; Brooks v.

Bowie for appellee. \n\n[241 U.S. 199, 200]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n J. Downey Harvey of San Francisco was adjudged a bankrupt November 17, 1911. Appellant, having become trustee of the estate, instituted this proceeding to set aside a transfer by the bankrupt to his wife-defendant in error-of certain stock in Shore Line Investment Company, because made without consideration and with intent to delay and defraud his creditors. The complaint alleges that the gift was made and stock transferred in November, 1909, when it is admitted Harvey was insolvent. Mrs. Harvey maintains that her husband gave the stock and actually delivered the properly indorsed certificate to her in 1905, during all of which year his solvency is conceded. The substantial controversy throughout has been upon the question of fact thus raised.\n Having heard witnesses, the trial court held the transfer was made in 1909, and rendered a decree in favor of the trustee. The circuit court of appeals, after a careful review of the evidence, reached a contrary conclusion. 134 C. C. A. 635, 219 Fed. 17. We are now asked to reverse its decree and sustain the trial court.\n Notwithstanding doubts necessarily engendered by some conflicting statements and questionable circumstances, upon consideration of the whole record we think the decision of the circuit court of appeals is correct.\n Appellant also suggests (a) that the gift is void because Mrs. Harvey permitted her husband for more than four years to retain apparent title to the stock and hold himself out as its real owner; and (b) that there was no actual and continuous change of possession, as required by the state statute against fraudulent conveyances. In reply to these suggestions it seems only necessary to cite National Bank v. Western P. R. Co. 157 Cal. 573, 581, 27 L.R.A.(N.S.) 987, 108 Pac. 676, 21 Ann.

NOTASEME HOSIERY CO(1916)\nNo. 184\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 1916\n\n\n\n Mr. Edmond E. Wise for petitioners.\n Messrs. E. Hayward Fairbanks and James H. Griffin for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill in equity brought by the Notaseme Hosiery Company to restrain infringement of a registered trademark and unfair competition alleged to have been practised by the petitioners, and to recover damages and \n\n[240 U.S. 179, 180]\n\u00a0\n profits. The plaintiff's trademark, as registered, was a rectangle with a black band running from the left hand upper to the right hand lower corner, the upper and lower panels on the two sides of the band being printed in red. As used, it contained the word 'Notaseme' in white script upon the black band, with the words 'Trade Mark' in small letters upon the white, and beneath the label was printed 'Reg. U. S. Pat. Office.' In fact registration had been refused to the label with the word 'Notaseme' upon it, that word being merely a corrupted description of the seamless hosiery sold. The defendants, among other items of a large retail business in New York, sold hose with seams, which they advertised under the name 'Irontex.' After this name had been adopted, in pursuance of their request designs were submitted to them and one was chosen. It turned out that this was made by the printer who had made the Notaseme label. It also was a rectangle with a diagonal black band and red panels, the band in this case running from the right hand upper corner to the left hand lower, and having the word 'Irontex' in white script upon the band and 'The hose that- wears like iron' printed in black upon the two triangles of red. The defendants never had seen or heard of the plaintiff, its label or its goods, until November, 1909, when they were notified by the plaintiff that they were infringing its registered trademark. They ultimately stood upon their rights.\n At the original hearing in the circuit court it was held that the plaintiff had embodied such a misrepresentation in the trademark as used that it would not be protected, and that unfair dealing was not made out. This decision was reversed by the circuit court of appeals on the ground that although the evidence did not show actual deception, the label used by the defendants so far resembled the plaintiff's that it would have deception as its natural result, and that the plaintiff was entitled to \n\n[240 U.S. 179, 181]\n\u00a0\n relief whether the trademark on its label was good or bad as such. 119 C. C. A. 134, 201 Fed. 99. The plaintiff was allowed to recover profits from a reasonable time after the defendants had notice of the similarity of the two designs, which was put at January 1, 1910. 209 Fed. 495, 131 C. C. A. 503, 215 Fed. 361.\n We agree with the circuit court that the plaintiff is not in a position to recover for an infringement of a registered trademark. The mark that it used held out to the public as registered in the Patent Office precisely the element that had been rejected there. It affirmed that the authority of the United States had sanctioned that for which that authority had been refused, and by grasping at too much lost all, so far as this case is concerned. Holzapfel's Compositions Co. v. Rahtjen's American Composition Co. \n183 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 46 S. L. ed. 49, 53, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 6. The liability of the defendant must be derived from unfair competition if it exists.\n That it was unfair to continue the use of a label so similar in general character to the plaintiff's we are not disposed to deny. But it does not follow that the defendants are chargeable with profits as a matter of course. Very possibly the statutory rule for wrongful use of a trademark may be extended by analogy to unfair competition in a proper case. But, as the ground of recovery in the latter instance is that the defendant has taken some undue advantage of the plaintiff's reputation, or that of his goods, and as the nature and extent of the wrong may vary indefinitely, it cannot be assumed in all cases that the defendant's sales were due to that alone.\n Ordinarily imitation is enough to imply that the matter imitated is important, at least, to the sale of the goods. But when the similarity arises as the one before us did, it indicates nothing, except perhaps the poverty of the designer's invention. Furthermore the defendants' persistence in their use of the design after notice proves little or nothing against them. They had been advertising \n\n[240 U.S. 179, 182]\n\u00a0\n their goods by name and using the design in connection with the name. The natural interpretation is not that they wanted to steal the plaintiff's good will, of which they then learned for the first time, but that they wished to preserve their own. When they stood upon their rights of course they made themselves responsible for the continued use of a label that might be held likely to deceive, and if it should be held manifestly to have that tendency, they would be chargeable for what, in contemplation of law, was an intentional wrong, or a fraud, although the case is wholly devoid of any indication of an actual intent to deceive, or to steal the reputation of the plaintiff's goods. If the defendants' conduct was a wrong, as we have assumed, it was a wrong knowingly committed, but no further inference against the defendants can be drawn from the fact.\n It seems a strong thing to give relief on the ground of unfair competition when the supposed unfairness consists mainly in the imitation of a device that sought, obtained, and lost protection as a trademark. If a would-be trademark loses its protection as such, that means that the public has a right to use it, and it would be strange to bring the protection back simply by giving it another name. If the red square with the diagonal black band is not a trademark, it would seem to be free to the world. See Flagg Mfg. Co. v. Holway, 178 Mass. 83, 91, 59 N. E. 667. Saxlehner v. Wagner, \n216 \nU.S. 375, 380\n, 381 S., 54 L. ed. 525, 527, 528, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 298. We assume that, coupled with the script upon the band, there is sufficient pictorial similarity to deceive some persons, but, unless we go considerably farther, to charge the defendants with all the profits would be unjust.\n The question remains whether the petitioners' sales probably were induced to any large extent by confusion in the mind of the public between the petitioners' goods and the plaintiff's. The goods were different in character, were called by a different name, were sold mainly in different \n\n[240 U.S. 179, 183]\n\u00a0\n places and by parties not likely to be mistaken for each other. The petitioners had advertised them as Irontex since April, 1908. Their business was that of retailers in the city of New York, where they were widely known. The Notaseme Company's business was wholesale, from Philadelphia, starting with New England and the South. So far as purchasers bought because the petitioners recommended the goods, or on the strength of the name, by whatever recommended, as distinguished from the colors and figures of the label, or from knowledge of the specific article, or from preference for full fashioned over seamless hose, or for any reason but the inducement of the red square, bar, and script supposed to indicate the plaintiff's hose, the plaintiff has no claim on the petitioners' profits.\n There is some indication that the plaintiff's business was mainly in hosiery for men, while Macy & Company's was more than three quarters for women and children. That the name, which the defendants do not imitate, but, on the contrary, exclude by using another wholly unlike it, was thought more important by the plaintiff than it now is willing to admit, is shown not only by the use of it upon the trademark proper, but by the adoption of a new name for the plaintiff company to conform to it. Taking all these considerations into account, coupled with the absence of evidence that any deceit or substitution was accomplished in fact, we find it impossible to believe that any considerable part of the petitioner's business was due to their goods being supposed to be the plaintiff's hose. The petitioners properly were enjoined from further use of the mark in controversy, but, so far as the decree charged them with profits, it is reversed.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Pitney dissent. \n\n\n\n","193":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUPREME LODGE K OF P v. MIMS(1916)\nNo. 345\nArgued: Decided: June 12, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 574, 575]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. M. M. Crane, H. P. Brown, Edward Crane, James P. Goodrich, Ward H. Watson, James E. Watson, and Sol. H. Esarey for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Lawrence C. McBride, Joseph E. Cockrell, and Edward Gray for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit against a corporation chartered by Congress on June 29, 1894 (chap. 119, 28 Stat. at L. 96), to recover all sums paid by the plaintiff, the defendant in error, to the defendant and its predecessors; the ground alleged being that the defendant, the plaintiff in error, has demanded monthly dues in excess of its rights, and thereby has entitled the plaintiff to recover all that he had paid, with interest.\n The facts are as follows: The plaintiff originally took out two certificates of insurance from an earlier corporation of the same name, the charter of which expired on \n\n[241 U.S. 574, 576]\n\u00a0\n August 5, 1890. In May, 1885, he surrendered these certificates and took out a new one in what was called the Fourth Class, by which, in consideration of his original declarations and representations, and of the payment 'of all monthly payments as required, and the full compliance with all the laws governing this rank, now in force, or that may hereafter be enacted and shall be in good standing under said laws,' the sum of $3,000 was to be paid to the plaintiff's wife, or such other beneficiary as he might direct in proper form, upon notice and proof of death and good standing at the time; provided, as hereafter stated. It was further stipulated that any violation of the conditions mentioned or the requirements of the laws governing this rank should avoid all claims. By the certificate of incorporation the corporation had power 'to alter and amend its Constitution and by-laws at will;' the laws of 1880, then in force, provided that 'these laws [regulating assessments inter alia] may be altered or amended at any regular session of the Supreme Lodge K. of P.;' and by his original application the plaintiff agreed to conform to the laws and regulations of the order then in force or that might thereafter be enacted, or submit to the penalties therein contained.\n The plaintiff contends that his contract took him out of these reiterated provisions for possible change; and his ground is that by article 5,  4, of the laws of 1884, creating the Fourth Class, the endowment fund for the payment of benefits in that class was to be derived from monthly payments from each member for each $1,000 of endowment, to be graded according to the age of the member at the time of making application, and his expectancy of life, the age to be taken at the nearest birthday, 'Said monthly payments shall be based upon the average expectancy of life of the applicant, and shall continue the same so long as his membership continues.' A table appended gave the rate for the different ages from \n\n[241 U.S. 574, 577]\n\u00a0\n twenty-one to sixty. At that time members were transferred to the Fourth Class at the original entry age, which, in the plaintiff's case, was forty- two. These same laws of 1884 repeated the former provision as to amendment by the Supreme Lodge, now requiring a two-thirds vote. The recension of 1886 repeated the last-mentioned provision, and set forth a form of application by which the applicant agreed not only, as heretofore, that he, but also that 'this contract, shall be controlled' by the laws then in force or that might be enacted thereafter. The power to alter was applied in 1888 to the payments to be made by the Fourth Class. The board of control was ordered to rerate members transferred to the Fourth Class as the plaintiff was, so that thereafter they should pay as of the age at which they were transferred, instead of that at which they first became members. Thereafter the plaintiff paid as of the age of forty-eight.\n After the charter expired, in 1890, the business was kept going under the same name by a voluntary association, the plaintiff paying his assessments as before, until on June 29, 1894, the act of Congress mentioned incorporated certain persons named, 'officers and members of the Supreme Lodge Knights of Pythias,' by the name of 'The Supreme Lodge Knights of Pythias,' and authorized them to use the powers 'incidental to fraternal and benevolent corporations within the District of Columbia.' By the 3d section of the charter 'all claims, accounts, debts, things in action, or other matters of business of whatever nature now existing for or against the present Supreme Lodge Knights of Pythias, mentioned in  1 of this act, shall survive and succeed to and against the body corporate and politic hereby created; provided that nothing contained herein shall be construed to extend the operation of any law which provides for the extinguishing of claims or contracts by limitations of time.' This is the main ground upon which the defendant is \n\n[241 U.S. 574, 578]\n\u00a0\n sought to be charged with the certificate issued by the former corporation. By  4 'said corporation shall have a constitution and shall have power to amend the same at pleasure; provided, that such constitution or amendments thereof do not conflict with the laws of the United States or of any state.' Amendments to the laws of the association were adopted this same year, 1894, by one of which the existing rates were retained, and it was provided that each member of the endowment rank should continue to pay the same amount each month thereafter so long as he remained a member, 'unless otherwise provided for by the Supreme Lodge or board of control of the endowment rank.' A similar provision was made in 1900, but the rate for the age of forty-eight was made $2.45, or $7.35 for the $3,000 in the certificate. The plaintiff paid the rates as established from time to time.\n The split came in 1910. In that year the corporation passed a law providing for a rerating of every member of the Fourth Class on January 1, 1911, in accordance with his attained age and occupation, under which the plaintiff's monthly payment would be raised to $34.80, unless he accepted one of several options offered to him. It should be added that his occupation played no part, as it was not ranked as hazardous. He was notified, but declined to pay or otherwise accede to the change. On January 20, 1911, he tendered $22.05 for the months of January, February, and March of that year, the tender was refused, and in May this suit was begun. The court of civil appeals affirmed a judgment for the plaintiff on a verdict directed by the trial court, modifying it so far as to confine the recovery to payments made since the issue of the certificate of 1885, with interest. An application to the supreme court for a writ of error was refused.\n There is a motion to dismiss, but as the case necessarily will turn on the construction of the present charter, an act of Congress, and the defendant justifies under it, the \n\n[241 U.S. 574, 579]\n\u00a0\n motion is denied. Creswill v. Grand Lodge, K. P. \n225 \nU.S. 246, 258\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1074, 1078, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 822. There is no ground for treating the plaintiff as not having come into the new company by virtue of  3. That section provided for his doing so, and when he was treated and acted as a member, the presumption is conclusive that he did so in pursuance of the law that authorized it.\n We assume without argument that by  3 of the charter, and his assent thereto, the plaintiff became a member of the organization, with whatever rights he might have as such. It is not to be conceived, however, that the charter was intended to create a privileged class, or that the right of the corporation to amend its laws was less in his case than in that of one joining after 1894. As to later members, we can have no doubt, notwithstanding the difference of opinion in state courts, that the right to amend extends to a change in the rates to be paid. Persons who join institutions of this sort are not dealing at arm's length with a stranger whose mode of providing for payment does not concern them, but only his promise to pay. They are joining a club the members of which have to pay any benefit that any member can receive. The corporation is simply the machine for collection and distribution. Its charter expressly provides by  5 that it 'shall not engage in any business for gain; the purpose of said corporation being fraternal and benevolent.' It is manifest, therefore, that it would be a perversion of its purposes if, through some ambiguity of phrase, the necessary source of benefits were closed in favor of certain members, while their right to insist upon payment remained. The essence of the arrangement was that the members took the risk of events, and if the assessments levied at a certain time were insufficient to pay a benefit of a certain amount, whether from diminution of members or any other cause, either they must pay more or the beneficiary take less. \n\n[241 U.S. 574, 580]\n\u00a0\n The same conditions applied to the original corporation, and the plaintiff testifies that he understood them. He says in so many words that he knew that the only source of revenue to meet his and other policies was from assessments of the insured, and that if, after a proper rate was fixed for a membership of five thousand, the membership fell to two thousand, the rate would have to be increased if the obligations were to be met. The statute and the words of the law of the company under which the plaintiff entered the Fourth Class should be construed in the light of these considerations. In determining his rights it is important to bear in mind that there was no specific promise to him, like the promise to pay, in the certificate, but that his whole reliance is upon a law of the corporation; and that he had notice that all laws of the corporation were liable to be repealed. The only language in the certificate bearing on the matter pointed to possible changes, one condition being the payment of all monthly payments 'as required.' It was obvious and understood that, to pay a benefit, an increase in the assessment might be necessary. In our opinion the present charter, like the first, must be construed to authorize such an increase, and the clause in the law of 1884, relied upon,- that the payments should continue the same so long as the membership continued,-was not a contract, but was a regulation subject to the possibility inherent in the case. More than ambiguous words in an amendable law would be needed to establish a departure from the ground on which the relation of the parties obviously stood, and to create a privilege that attacked the corporation in its very life. Compare the language in Supreme Council, R. A. v. Green, \n237 \nU.S. 531, 542\n, 59 S. L. ed. 1089, 1100, L.R.A.1916A, 771, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 724, and the same case below, sub nom. Reynolds v. Supreme Council, R. A. 192 Mass. 150, 157, 7 L. R.A.(N.S.) 1154, 78 N. E. 129, 7 Ann. Cas. 776.\n The persons incorporated in 1894 were described as officers and members of the Supreme Lodge then existing; that is, of a voluntary association; and it was the rights and duties of that association that the defendant assumed, if we are to take the words in their literal sense. We spend no time upon the inquiry what those rights \n\n[241 U.S. 574, 581]\n\u00a0\n and duties were, because, as we have said, we assume that the plaintiff acquired a standing in the new company. But in the second stage, as in the first, the law establishing the Fourth Class had received a practical construction as being open to change, by the continued rating of the plaintiff at forty-eight instead of forty-two, as at first, and although the plaintiff says in a general way that he protested, he paid, and he had notice of what the earlier companies asserted to be their rights when he came into the new one that asserted the same and put them in force as against him. We mention these details to show that the plaintiff suffers no injustice and meets with no surprise when we state our opinion that the assumption under  3 of the new charter of a relation with the plaintiff that originally arose under a law of the old corporation was not the assumption of a contract for immutable assessments, and decide that the power to amend, given by  4, included the power to raise the rates to such point as was necessary for the corporation to go on.\n The plaintiff's certificate did not absolutely promise to pay $3,000 if the plaintiff had performed the conditions. It contained a proviso by which, if one monthly payment by members holding an equal amount of endowment should not be sufficient to pay the sum, the amount of the monthly payment should be the benefit received. If all other Fourth Class certificates were in similar form, it may be asked whether it was reasonable to increase the assessments rather than to allow the payments to abate. The answer, in addition to what we already have said, is that, unless the corporation continued to make substantial payments at death, it could not go on. On the evidence, at the end of 1910 the plaintiff's certificate was worth very little or nothing. It well may have been \n\n[241 U.S. 574, 582]\n\u00a0\n thought better to rehabilitate the class rather than to allow their certificates to become waste paper. At all events, that was the prevailing view in the republic to which the plaintiff belonged, and, as we have said, the charter authorized it to be enforced. It is unnecessary to discuss the options that were offered in the alternative, but it is proper to remember that for many years the plaintiff has been insured, and although by what he is not likely to regard as bad fortune his beneficiary has not profited by it, she would have if he had died. As he happily has lived, he has to bear the burdens incident to the nature of the enterprise into which he went open-eyed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","194":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSWIFT & CO. v.

Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, \n111 U.S. 379\n, 28 L. ed. 462, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 510.\n The provisions of the Bankruptcy Act for consideration in this connection are:\n'Section 24. The Supreme Court of the United States, the circuit courts of appeals of the United States, and the supreme courts of the territories, in vacation in chambers and during their respective terms, as now or as they may be hereafter held, are hereby invested with appellate jurisdiction of controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings from the courts of bankruptcy from which they have appellate jurisdiction in other cases.\n\n'The Supreme Court of the United States shall exercise a like jurisdiction from courts of bankruptcy not within any organized circuit of the United States and from the supreme court of the District of Columbia.\n\n ... * *\n'Section 25. That appeals, as in equity cases, may be taken in bankruptcy proceedings from the courts of bankruptcy to the circuit court of appeals of the United States, and to the supreme court of the territories, in the following cases, to wit: (1) from a judgment adjudging or refusing to adjudge the defendant a bankrupt; . . .' [30 Stat. at L. 553, chap. 541, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9608, 9609.]\n\n The same provision as to the review by this court of controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings is carried into the Judicial Code,  252 [ 36 Stat. at L. 1159, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1229], in which provision in made for the review in this court of controversies arising in bank- \n\n[242 U.S. 107, 109]\n\u00a0\n ruptcy proceedings in the supreme court of the District of Columbia.\n It is apparent from reading these sections of the statute that a direct appeal to this court from the supreme court of the District of Columbia is allowed only in controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings, and not from the steps in a bankruptcy proceeding. The nature of such controversies has been frequently considered in decisions of this court, and needs little discussion now. Such controversies embrace litigation which arises after the adjudication in bankruptcy, sometimes by intervention, the parties claiming title to property in the hands of the trustee, or other actions, usually plenary in character, concerning the right and title to the bankrupt's estate. Such proceedings as the present one, resulting in a decree refusing to adjudicate the defendant a bankrupt, are but steps in a bankruptcy proceeding, and not controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings within the meaning of the statute. First Nat. Bank v. Klug, \n186 U.S. 202\n, 46 L. ed. 1127, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 899.\n The decisions of this court in Tefft, W. & Co. v. Munsuri, \n222 U.S. 114\n, 56 L. ed. 118, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 67, and Munsuri v. Fricker, \n222 U.S. 121\n, 56 L. ed. 121, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 70, are decisive of this point. In the first of these cases there was an attempt to prosecute a direct appeal to this court from the district court of the United States for Porto Rico, where the proceeding was based upon a claim in bankruptcy. It was there held that an order of the bankruptcy court of Porto Rico, disallowing the claim, was not a controversy arising in a bankruptcy proceeding within the meaning of the statute. The contention that such action, based upon a claim filed in a bankruptcy proceeding, was appealable to this court, was denied, the court saying:\n'But the entire argument rests upon a misconception of the words 'controversies in bankruptcy proceedings,' as used in the section, since it disregards the authoritative \n\n[242 U.S. 107, 110]\n\u00a0\n construction affixed to those words. Coder v. Arts, \n213 \nU.S. 223, 234\n, 53 S. L. ed. 772, 777, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 436, 16 Ann. Cas. 1008; Hewit v. Berlin Mach. Works, \n194 \nU.S. 296, 300\n, 48 S. L. ed. 986, 987, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690. Those cases expressly decide that controversies in bankruptcy proceedings as used in the section do not include mere steps in proceedings in bankruptcy, but embrace controversies which are not of that inherent character, even although they may arise in the course of proceedings in bankruptcy.'\n\n It is true that in Audubon v. Shufeldt, \n181 U.S. 575\n, 45 L. ed. 1009, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 735, and in Armstrong v. Fernandez, \n208 U.S. 324\n, 52 L. ed. 514, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 419, this court did review proceedings in bankruptcy-in one case from the District of Columbia, and in the other from the district court of the United States for Porto Rico. Of the Armstrong Case, which was a review by appeal of an adjudication of bankruptcy, this court, in the Tefft, W. & Co. Case, supra, said:\n'It is true, as suggested in argument that in Armstrong v. Fernandez, supra, jurisdiction was exerted to review the action of the court below in a case which was not susceptible of being reviewed under the construction of the statute which we have here applied. But in that case there was no appearance of counsel for the appellee, and while a general suggestion was made in the argument of appellant as to the duty of the court not to exceed its jurisdiction, no argument concerning the want of jurisdiction was made. The case therefore in substance proceeded upon a tacit assumption of the existence of jurisdiction,-an assumption which would not be now possible in consequence of the authoritative construction given to  24 (a) in Coder v. Arts, supra. Under these circumstances, the mere implication as to the meaning of the statute, resulting from the jurisdiction which was in that case merely assumed to exist, is not controlling, and the Armstrong Case, therefore, in so far as it conflicts with the construction which we here give the statute, must be deemed to be qualified and limited.' \n\n[242 U.S. 107, 111]\n\u00a0\n It may be true that Congress has failed to give an appellate review in proceedings in bankruptcy from the supreme court of the District of Columbia from a decree with reference to an adjudication in bankruptcy, but, as observed in the Tefft, W. & Co. Case, that does not give this court authority to assume jurisdiction not given to it by law.\n\n It follows that the appeal and writ of error must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","195":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTANNER v. LITTLE(1916)\nNo. 224\nArgued: Decided: March 6, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 369, 369]\n\u00a0\n This case was submitted with No. 41, and attacks the validity of a statute of the state of Washington of the same general import and purpose as the Florida statute passed on in No. 41. [\n240 U.S. 342\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 370.]\n The statute requires that every person, etc., who shall use or furnish to any other person, etc., to use in, with, or for the sale of any goods, etc., any stamps, etc., which shall entitle the purchaser receiving the same with such sale of goods, etc., to procure from any person, etc., any goods, etc., free of charge, or for less than the retail market price thereof, upon the production of any number of such stamps, etc., shall, before so furnishing, selling, or using \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 370]\n\u00a0\n the same, obtain a license from the auditor of each county wherein such furnishing or selling or using shall take place for each and every store or place of business in that county, owned or conducted by such person, etc., from which such furnishing or selling, or in which such using, shall take place.\n The statute fixes the license at $6,000, and there is a prohibition of the use of the stamps, etc., in any town, city, or county other than that in which they are furnished or sold. Violation of the act is made a 'gross misdemeanor.'\n The complainants are nineteen in number, counting partnerships as single individuals, and engaged in the business of hardware, cleaning and dyeing, grocery, soap, canned goods, meats, drugs, dry goods, boots and shoes, fuel, photography, laundry, and wine. Complainants sue for all similarly situated.\n Their allegations, condensed and narratively stated, are as follows: They carry on their respective businesses at Spokane, state of Washington, and advertise in various ways, which are enumerated, including the premium advertising system, so-called, and have at various times, for the purpose of increasing their general trade and volume of business, especially their cash trade, adopted and used a premium advertising system conducted as follows: with the sale of their goods and merchandise they each give to their cash customers stamps, tickets, or coupons at the rate of one stamp for each cash purchase of a convenient unit amount, as one stamp for each 5, 10, or 25-cent cash purchase, as the case may be, which stamps or coupons entitled their customers to the choice of a certain cash discount or, free of charge, to certain articles of merchandise of their own selection, when presented in certain prescribed numbers for redemption to complainants who redeem their own stamps or certificates, or to a third party with whom other of the complainants have contracts, many of which are still in force, for the use of their premium \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 371]\n\u00a0\n advertising system, including the use of their trading stamps or coupons used in connection therewith, and the redemption thereof in merchandise.\n Many of the complainants accept the coupons, at the cash value thereon printed, in payment or part payment of the cash retail price of the premium articles.\n The stamps and coupons are redeemable in accordance with the terms of printed catalogues or premium lists. Booklets are distributed free among complainants' customers and describe the articles which may be secured by the stamps or coupons, and state the number thereof required to obtain the same. The delivery of the required number of stamps or coupons set forth in the list is in full payment for the article specified, and no money or other consideration is charged therefor.\n There is no element of chance involved in the system. The value of each article is fixed as to cash and merchandise redemption and the right of every holder is secure. The articles are of sound value and durable manufacture and are open to inspection during business hours. The premiums are not regularly dealt in by many of the complainants, but are used exclusively in connection with premium advertising.\n A number of complainants have contracts based on the system, running from one to five years for the use of their premium advertising system, including their trading stamps in connection therewith, which contracts are now in force and were in force at the passage of the act, and a large unmber of stamps are now in the hands of complainants, and if they are prevented from disposing of them complainants will suffer great and irreparable loss.\n A great many manufacturers of various lines of merchandise, for the purpose of advertising their businesses and increasing the volume of their sales, inclose in the packages of their merchandise coupons and other premium tokens which entitle the purchaser of such merchandise to \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 372]\n\u00a0\n other articles of merchandise free of charge. The number of the manufacturers is given, their names and the articles which they manufacture.\n Complainants have upon their shelves large quantities of merchandise in which premium tokens are packed, which, upon their sale, entitle purchasers to other articles in the manner described, and in such packages are tobacco and tobacco products, and the use of the coupons and tickets as described is authorized and rendered lawful by  3394 of the Revised Statutes of the United States and the amendments of that section in 1897 [ 30 Stat. at L. 206, chap. 11,  10] and 1902 [32 Stat. at L. 715, chap. 1371,  2, Comp. Stat. 1913,  6204].\n The adoption of the premium advertising system enables complainants to give a discount upon purchases of small as well as large amounts, one coupon or stamp being given with each 5, 10, or 25-cent cash purchase, or multiple thereof, as the case may be. And a larger discount in merchandise can be given than otherwise there could be because, as a result of large purchases of the merchandise given in exchange for the tokens, the articles are secured at much less than the regular retail price. By reason of the system complainants have been enabled at a moderate cost to greatly increase their businesses and profits, and are benefited because their articles in the homes of their customers are a continual advertisement. And the businesses are lawful ones, and not prejudicial to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare.\n The statute of Washington violates the provisions of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in that it deprives complainants of their property without due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws (a) because it is not equal and uniform in operation, each of the complainants paying their taxes as do other merchants engaged in similar lines of business, and who use other and various methods of advertising, and \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 373]\n\u00a0\n who are not required to pay a license tax of $6,000. The statute is therefore arbitrary and discriminatory. (b) The tax is not upon the businesses of complainants, but upon their incidents, and is an unwarrantable interference with the method and manner of conducting the same, is arbitrary, oppressive, discriminatory, is in excess of profits and prohibitive, and, while in the guise of revenue, will produce none. (c) It deprives complainants of their liberty and property without due process of law inasmuch as they cannot bestow a gift or give an order upon another merchant for a gift to a customer, which is the exercise of a natural right, without paying on onerous and excessive tax. (d) The penalties and fines are so drastic and excessive that they deter complainants from violating the act and testing its validity in a court of law. (e) The statute is in contravention of  10, article 1, of the Constitution of the United States, in that it impairs the obligations of contracts with and the right of complainants to contract with their customers to give trading stamps and coupons with the purchase of merchandise redeemable in merchandise heretofore given by them. It also impairs the obligations of contracts entered into by complainants with third parties for the use of the advertising system, including the use of the stamps and coupons and the redemption thereof in merchandise. (f) The statute is partial, unreasonable, oppressive, unequal, in restraint of trade, and prohibitive of lawful business. (g) The statute conflicts with  3394 of the Revised Statutes of the United States and the amendments thereof (Comp. Stat. 1913 ,  6204). (h) It is criminal, making a crime of acts the test of which is incapable of ascertainment; that is, it makes a crime of furnishing stamps or similar devices which are redeemable 'for less than the retail market price thereof,' the premium article having no definite or fixed retail market price. The statute is therefore void for indefiniteness and uncertainty; and such provision is besides prohibitive of the business, \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 374]\n\u00a0\n as the articles are not dealt in by complainants except in connection with the premium system. And further, that the statute is void because it attempts to fix the price at which complainants shall sell their merchandise.\n The prosecuting attorney of the county threatens to enforce the provisions of the statute, to bring numerous criminal prosecutions as well as civil suits to enforce the payment of the license, and if complainants are forced to discontinue their business as described they will suffer great and irreparable damage because they have expended large sums of money in advertising the premium system, which expenditures would be a total loss, they having large stocks of merchandise on hand in which are packed the premium tokens, and which cannot be removed without practically destroying the packages and the value of the merchandise contained therein, and that therefore, if not permitted to dispose of them, complainants will lose a large amount of money.\n Complainants have outstanding in the hands of customers a large amount of tokens, the result of transactions before the passage of the statute, and it will be necessary, in order to keep faith with their customers, for complainants to redeem such tokens in merchandise in the future from time to time as the necessary and requisite number of the same are presented for redemption. It they fail to do so they will lose many customers and a large amount of trade and suffer thereby great loss and injury.\n Having no remedy at law, complainants pray an injunction, first temporary and then perpetual.\n A temporary restraining order was issued, which the attorney general and the prosecuting attorney general and the separately made motions to quash, each appearing only for that purpose. The motions asserted exemption from suit of those officers in a Federal court because the suit was against them as officers of the state to prevent the enforcement of the criminal laws of the state, and was \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 375]\n\u00a0\n therefore a suit against the state, in violation of the 11th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n Subsequently motions to dismiss were filed by them and also by the defendant Evenson, county treasurer of Spokane county. The grounds of the motions alleged were misjoinder of parties complainants and of defendants, improper union of causes of suit, insufficiency of the facts alleged to justify the relief prayed, the adequacy of a remedy at law, and the absence of jurisdiction over the persons of the defendants or of the subject-matter of the action.\n The motion for an interlocutory injunction came before three judges. Rudkin, district judge, delivered the opinion and judgment ordering an injunction was prayed. 208 Fed. 605. This appeal was then taken.\n Messrs. D. V. Halverstadt, Blackburn Esterline, and Mr. W. V. Tanner, Attorney General of Washington, in propria persona, for appellants. \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 376]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. T. Dovell and Frank T. Wolcott for appellees.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 369, 380]\n\u00a0\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n The court ruled against the motions to dismiss, and, concurring with the ruling as far as it retained jurisdiction of the suits and the persons of the defendants, we pass to the consideration of the validity of the statute of the state. Of that it was said: 'The court is fully satisfied from a bare inspection of the act without more, and without considering the affidavits on file, that it is and was intended to be prohibitive of the business methods against which it is directed. It is plainly manifest that no merchant could afford to pay the sum of $6,000 annually for the mere privilege of giving away trading stamps or allowing discounts on his cash sales. But if this were the only objection to the act, it may be that the courts would be powerless to enjoin its execution. The power of taxation rests upon necessity and is inherent in every independent state. It is as extensive as the range of subjects over which the government extends; it is absolute and unlimited, in the absence of constitutional limitations and restraints, and carries with it the power to embarrass and destroy. Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Charleston, \n153 U.S. 699\n, 38 L. ed. 874, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 637, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1094; McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 49 L. ed. 78, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561; Kehrer v. Stewart, \n197 U.S. 60\n, 49 L. ed. 663, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403.' [ 208 Fed. 609.]\n The charge of discrimination against the statute was decided to be a factor as to its validity. The use of trading stamps and other similar devices was regarded as a legitimate system of advertising, and that to distinguish it from other systems of advertising was a violation of the equality clause of the Federal Constitution. And it was said: 'As well might the legislature classify separately those who advertise in the columns of the daily papers, by bill boards, or by electrical signs, and impose a tax upon them to the exclusion of others engaged in the same business or calling who do not so advertise.' \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 381]\n\u00a0\n In this conclusion we think, for the reasons expressed in Rast v. Van Deman & L. Co. just decided [\n240 U.S. 342\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 370], that the court erred. We have been at pains to summarize the bill in this case to show its similitude to that.\n The coupons in this case, in compliance with the law of the state of Washington (Laws of 1907, p. 742), must be redeemed in cash if demanded by the purchaser; otherwise in articles of merchandise selected by him. The redemption of the coupons in some instances is directly by the merchant issuing them; in others, it is alleged, by 'a third party, with whom said complainants have a contract for the use of their trading stamps or coupons used in connection therewith and the redemption thereof in merchandise.' These differences, however, do not affect the principle announced in No. 41. Whether the coupons are prepared by the issuing merchant or prepared by another, whether they be redeemed by him or by another, is but a phase of the system, not affecting its essential character. And we may say here, as we said in No. 41, that we are not concerned with consideration of a business in which coupons, etc., are issued or used and not redeemed in merchandise; that is, where they are used as a rebate upon the price of the article or a discount upon purchases, nor with the legality of a statute which should regulate or prevent such use of the coupons disassociated from other uses of them. Complainants contend for a broad use, and assert that there cannot legally be any limitation of their methods of redemption, which they comprehensively denominate the 'premium system.'\n The opinion in No. 41 is, therefore, decisive of the contentions in this case. We said there that there were manifest differences between the 'premium system' of advertising and the other methods enumerated, and that those differences justified a difference in measures. And this is justified not only by the wide \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 382]\n\u00a0\n discretion which may be exercised in legislation, but by a rigid principle of classification. Classification is not different in law than in other departments of knowledge. 'It is the grouping of things in speculation or practice because they 'agree with one another in certain particulars and differ from other things in those particulars.\" Billings v. Illinois, \n188 \nU.S. 97, 102\n, 47 S. L. ed. 400, 403, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 272. Upon what differences or resemblances it may be exercised depends necessarily upon the object in view, may be narrow or wide according to that object. Red things may be associated by reason of their redness, with disregard of all other resemblances or of distinctions. Such classification would be logically appropriate. Apply it further: make a rule of conduct depend upon it, and distinguish in legislation between red-haired men and black- haired men, and the classification would immediately be seen to be wrong; it would have only arbitrary relation to the purpose and province of legislation. The power of legislation over the subject-matter is hence to be considered. It may not make the distinction adverted to, but it may make others the appropriateness of which, considered logically, may be challenged; for instance: between sales of stock upon margin or for immediate or future delivery (Otis v. Parker, \n187 U.S. 606\n, 47 L. ed. 323, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 168); between acts directed against a regularly established dealer and one not so established (Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, \n226 U.S. 157\n, 57 L. ed. 164, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66); in an inspection law, between coal mines where more than five men are employed and coal mines where that or a lesser number are employed (Consolidated Coal Co. v. Illinois, \n185 U.S. 203\n, 46 L. ed. 872, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616); and a like distinction in a workmen's compensation law (Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v. Blagg, \n235 U.S. 571\n, 59 L. ed. 364, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 167, 7 N. C. C. A. 570); between a combination of purchasers and a combination of laborers ( International Harvester Co. v. Missouri, \n234 U.S. 199\n, 58 L. ed. 1276, 52 L.R.A.(N.S.) 525, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 859); between residents and nonresidents (Travellers' Ins. Co. v. Connecticut, \n185 U.S. 364\n, 46 L. ed. 949, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673); in a law requiring railroads to heat passenger coaches, between roads of 50 miles and \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 383]\n\u00a0\n roads of that length or less (New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. v. New York, \n165 U.S. 628\n, 41 L. ed. 853, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418; see also Dow v. Beidelman, \n125 U.S. 680\n, 31 L. ed. 841, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 56, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1028; Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 U.S. 688\n, 39 L. ed. 311, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 1, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 268, 360); between theaters according to the price of admission (Metropolis Theatre Co. v. Chicago, \n228 U.S. 61\n, 57 L. ed. 730, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441); between landowners as to liability for permitting certain noxious grasses to go to seed on the lands (Missouri, K . & T. R. Co. v. May, \n194 U.S. 267\n, 48 L. ed. 971, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638); between businesses in the solicitation of patronage on railroad trains and at depots (Williams v. Arkansas, \n217 U.S. 79\n, 54 L. ed. 673, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493, 18 Ann. Cas. 865); and a distinction based on the evidence of the qualifications of physicians (Watson v. Maryland, \n218 U.S. 179\n, 54 L. ed. 990, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644).\n Those were instances (and others might be cited) of the regulation of conduct and the restriction of its freedom, it being the conception of the legislature that the regulation and restriction were in the interest of the public welfare. Those classifications were sustained as legal, being within the power of the legislature over the subjectmatter, and having proper bases of community.\n But the classification which was sustained in Consolidated Coal Co. v. Illinois, \n185 U.S. 203\n, 46 L. ed. 872, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616, was condemned in Truax v. Raich, \n239 U.S. 33\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 7. The statute in the latter case required employers of more than five workers at any one time to employ not less than 80 per cent qualified electors or native-born citizens of the United States or of some subdivision of such. The statute was held void because there was no authority to deal with that at which the legislation was aimed. And this is important to be kept in mind. If there is no such authority, a classification, however logical, appropriate, or scientific, will not be sustained; if such authority exist, a classification may be deficient in those attributes, may be harsh and oppressive, and yet be within the power of the legislature. This has been declared many times. Let us apply the test to the case at bar. Let it be granted that the 'premium system' is a method of advertising; can there not be differences in advertising \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 384]\n\u00a0\n which may be subject to differences in legislation? Can there not be advertising at places or at times or in kind or effect subversive of public order or convenience? Fifth Ave. Coach Co. v. New York, \n221 U.S. 467\n, 55 L. ed. 815, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 709; Com. v. McCafferty, 145 Mass. 384, 14 N. E. 451. However, a decisive answer to the questions need not be given, for we have said, in Rast v. Van Deman & L. Co. that the 'premium system' is not one of advertising merely. It has other, and, it may be, deleterious, consequences. It does not terminate with the bringing together of seller and buyer, the profit of one and the desire of the other satisfied, the article bought and its price being equivalents. It is not so limited in purpose or effect. It has ulterior purpose, and how it has developed complainants vividly represent by their averments. It appears that companies are formed, called trading stamp companies,1 which extend and facilitate the schemes, making a seller of merchandise their agent for the distribution of stamps to be redeemed by them or other merchants, the profit of all being secured through the retail purchaser who has been brought under the attraction of the system. There must, therefore, be something more in it than the giving of discounts, something more than the mere laudation of wares. If companies-evolved from the system, as counsel say in justification of them-are able to reap a profit from it, it may well be thought there is something in it which is masked from the common eye, and that the purchaser at retail is made to believe that he can get more out of the fund than he has put into it, something of value which is not offset in the prices or quality of the articles which he buys. It is certain that the prices he pays make the \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 385]\n\u00a0\n efficiency of the system and the fund, if we may individualize it, out of which the cost of the instruments and agents of the system must be defrayed and the profit to all concerned paid. The system, therefore, has features different from the ordinary transactions of trade which have their impulse, as we have said, in immediate and definite desires having definite and measurable results. There may be in them at times reckless buying, but it is not provoked or systematized by the seller.\n Complainants charge that the tax of the statute is not upon the business, but upon its incidents. The separation is artificial. It is the incidents which give character to the business, affecting it with evil, it was thought, provoking therefore against it the power of the state, and taking away from it the immunity it else might have.\n It is unimportant what the incidents may be called, whether a method of advertising, discount giving, or profit sharing. Their significance is not in their designations, but in their influence upon the public welfare. And of this the judgment of the legislature must prevail, though it be controverted and opposed by arguments of strength. Nor is there support of the system or obstruction to the statute in declamation against sumptuary laws, nor in the assertion that there is evil lesson in the statute, nor in the prophecies which are ventured of more serious intermeddling with the conduct of business. Neither the declamation, the assertion, nor the prophecies can influence a present judgment. As to what extent legislation should interfere in affairs political philosophers have disputed and always will dispute. It is not in our province to engage on either side, nor to pronounce anticipatory judgments. We must wait for the instance. Our present duty is to pass upon the statute before us, and if it has been enacted upon a belief of evils that is not arbitrary we cannot measure their extent against the estimate of the legislature. McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 U.S. 539\n, 53 L. ed. 315, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 206. Such belief \n\n[240 U.S. 369, 386]\n\u00a0\n has many examples in state legislation, and, we have seen, it has persisted against adverse judicial opinion. If it may be said to be a judgment from experience as against a judgment from speculation; certainly, from its generality, it cannot be declared to be made in mere wantonness. Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, \n226 \nU.S. 157, 160\n, 57 S. L. ed. 164, 169, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66; Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192, 204\n, 205 S., 57 L. ed. 184, 188, 189, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44.\n Discrimination aside, the power to enact the legislation we need not discuss, but may refer to the opinion in No. 41. Of course, it is in the exercise of the police power of the state. We will not here define it or its limitations. As was said by Mr. Justice Brown, in Camfield v. United States, \n167 \nU.S. 518, 524\n, 42 S. L. ed. 260, 262, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 864, citing Rideout v. Knox, 148 Mass. 368, 2 L.R.A. 81, 12 Am. St. Rep. 560, 19 N. E. 390: 'The police power is not subject to any definite limitations, but is coextensive with the necessities of the case and the safeguard of the public interests.'\n In the view that the license is prohibitive we may concur, and concede that such is the effect given it by the supreme court of the state in State v. Pitney, 80 Wash. 699, 141 Pac. 883, one of the cases submitted with this one. And we think it was competent for the state to give it that effect. The cases cited by Judge Rudkin and those cited in the opinion in No. 41 so establish.\n For answer to the other contentions which we consider material to notice we refer to No. 41.\n Decree reversed and case remanded with directions to dismiss the bill. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Lansburgh v.

Thomas Dunlop for appellant.\n Mr. Conrad H. Syme for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit to restrain the Public Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia from exercising jurisdiction over the plaintiff. The Commission was created and its powers established by a section ( 8) of an appropriation act, divided into numbered paragraphs. Act of March 4, 1913, chap. 150,  8, 37 Stat. at L. 938, 974. By 2 of the section 'every public utility is hereby required to obey the lawful orders of the Commission,' and by 1 'public utility' embraces every common carrier, which phrase in turn is declared to include 'express companies and every corporation . . . controlling or managing any agency or agencies for public use for the conveyance of persons or property within the District of Columbia for hire.' Steam railroads, some other companies, and the Washington Terminal Company, are declared not to be within the words. The main question is whether the plaintiff is a common carrier under the definition in the act. The bill was dismissed by the supreme court, and the decree was affirmed by the court of appeals. 43 App. D. C. 120.\n The facts are agreed. The plaintiff is a Virginia corporation, authorized by its charter, with copious verbiage, to build, buy, sell, let, and operate automobiles, taxicabs, and other vehicles, and to carry passengers and goods by such vehicles; but not to exercise any of the powers of a public service corporation. It does business in the Dis- \n\n[241 U.S. 252, 254]\n\u00a0\n trict, and the important thing is what it does, not what its charter says. The first item, amounting to about thirty-five hundredths of the whole, is done under a lease for years from the Washington Terminal Company, the owner of the Union Railroad Station in Washington, which we have mentioned as excluded from the definition of common carriers. By this lease the plaintiff has the exclusive right to solicit livery and taxicab business from all persons passing to or from trains in the Union Station, and agrees in its turn to provide a service sufficient in the judgment of the Terminal Company to accommodate persons using the station, and is to pay over a certain percentage of the gross receipts. It may be assumed that a person taking a taxicab at the station would control the whole vehicle both as to contents, direction, and time of use, although not, so far as indicated, in such a sense as to make the driver of the machine his servant, according to familiar distinctions. The last facts, however, appear to be immaterial and in no degree to cast doubt upon the plaintiff's taxicabs, when employed as above stated, being a public utility by ancient usage and understanding (Munn v. Illinois, \n94 \nU.S. 113, 125\n, 24 S. L. ed. 77, 84), as well as common carriers by the manifest meaning of the act. The plaintiff is 'an agency for public use for the conveyance of persons,' etc.; and none the less that it only conveys one group of customers in one vehicle. The exception of the Terminal Company from the definition of common carriers does not matter. The plaintiff is not its servant and does not do business in its name or on its behalf. It simply hires special privileges and a part of the station for business of its own.\n The next item of the plaintiff's business, constituting about a quarter, is under contracts with hotels by which it agrees to furnish enough taxicabs and automobiles within certain hours reasonably to meet the needs of the hotel, receiving the exclusive right to solicit in and about \n\n[241 U.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n the hotel, but limiting its service to guests of the hotel. We do not perceive that this limitation removes the public character of the service, or takes it out of the definition in the act. No carrier serves all the public. His customers are limited by place, requirements, ability to pay, and other facts. But the public generally is free to go to hotels if it can afford to, as it is free to travel by rail, and through the hotel door to call on the plaintiff for a taxicab. We should hesitate to believe that either its contract or its public duty allowed it arbitrarily to refuse to carry a guest upon demand. We certainly may assume that in its own interest it does not attempt to do so. The service affects so considerable a fraction of the public that it is public in the same sense in which any other may be called so. German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, \n233 U.S. 389\n, 58 L. ed. 1011, L.R.A.1915C, 1189, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612. The public does not mean everybody all the time. See Peck v. Tribune Co. \n214 \nU.S. 185, 190\n, 53 S. L. ed. 960, 962, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 554, 16 Ann. Cas. 1075\n\n\n The rest of the plaintiff's business, amounting to four tenths, consists mainly in furnishing automobiles from its central garage on orders, generally by telephone. It asserts the right to refuse the service, and no doubt would do so if the pay was uncertain, but it advertises extensively, and, we must assume, generally accepts any seemingly solvent customer. Still, the bargains are individual, and however much they may tend towards uniformity in price, probably have not quite the mechanical fixity of charges that attends the use of taxicabs from the station and hotels. There is no contract with a third person to serve the public generally. The question whether, as to this part of its business, it is an agency for public use within the meaning of the statute, is more difficult. Whether it is or not, the jurisdiction of the Commission is established by what we have said, and it would not be necessary to decide the question if the bill, in addition to an injunction against taking jurisdiction, did not pray that order No. 44 of the Commission be declared void. That order, \n\n[241 U.S. 252, 256]\n\u00a0\n after declaring that the plaintiff was engaged in the business of a common carrier within the meaning of the act, and so was within the jurisdiction of the Commission, required the plaintiff to furnish the information called for in a circular letter of April 12, 1913. What this information was does not appear with technical precision, but we assume that it was in substance similar to a later requirement of a schedule showing all rates and charges in force for any service performed by the plaintiff within the District, or any service in connection therewith. If we are right, this demand was too broad unless the business from the garage also was within the act. There is no such connection between the charges for this last and the others as there was between the facts required and the business controlled in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co. \n224 \nU.S. 194, 211\n, 56 S. L. ed. 729, 736, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 436. Although I have not been able to free my mind from doubt, the court is of opinion that this part of the business is not to be regarded as a public utility. It is true that all business, and, for the matter of that, every life in all its details, has a public aspect, some bearing upon the welfare of the community in which it is passed. But, however it may have been in earlier days as to the common callings, it is assumed in our time that an invitation to the public to buy does not necessarily entail an obligation to sell. It is assumed that an ordinary shopkeeper may refuse his wares arbitrarily to a customer whom he dislikes, and although that consideration is not conclusive (\n233 U.S. 407\n), it is assumed that such a calling is not public as the word is used. In the absence of clear language to the contrary it would be assumed that an ordinary livery stable stood on the same footing as a common shop, and there seems to be no difference between the plaintiff's service from its garage and that of a livery stable. It follows that the plaintiff is not bound to give information as to its garage rates. \n\n[241 U.S. 252, 257]\n\u00a0\n Complaint is made that jurisdiction has not been assumed over some other concerns that stand on the same footing as the plaintiff. But there can be no pretense that the act is a disguised attempt to create preferences, or that the principle of Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 U.S. 356\n, 30 L. ed. 220, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1064, applies. The ground alleged by the Commission is that it did not consider that the omitted concerns did business sufficiently large in volume to come within the meaning of the act. There is nothing to impeach the good faith of the Commission, or to give the plaintiff just cause for complaint. The decree, so far as it asserts the jurisdiction of the Commission, is affirmed, but it must be modified so to restrain an inquiry into the rates charged by the plaintiff at its garage, or the exercise of jurisdiction over the same.\n Decree modified as above set forth. \n\n\n\n","197":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEXAS & P. RY. CO. v. RIGSBY(1916)\nNo. 523\nArgued: February 21, 1916Decided: April 17, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 33, 34]\n\u00a0\n Mr. F. H. Prendergast for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 33, 35]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S. P. Jones for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 33, 36]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n The defendant in error, Rigsby, while in the employ of plaintiff in error as a switchman in its yard at Marshall, Texas, was engaged, with others of the yard crew, in taking some 'bad order' cars to the shops there to be repaired. The switch engine and crew went upon a spur track, hauled out three cars, and switched them upon the main line, intending to go back upon the spur track for others, to be taken with the three to the shops, which were on the opposite side of the main line from the spur track. Rigsby, in the course of his duties, rode upon the top of one of the cars (a box car) in order to set the brakes and stop them and hold them upon the main line. He did this, and while descending from the car to return to the spur track he fell, owing to a defect in one of the hand holds or grab irons that formed the rungs of the ladder, and sustained personal injuries. This car had been out of service and waiting on the spur track for some days, perhaps a month. The occurrence took place September 4, 1912. In an action for damages, based upon the Federal Safety Appliance acts,1 the above facts appeared without dispute, and it was admitted that the main line of defendant's railroad was in daily use for the passage of freight and passenger trains in interstate commerce. The trial court instructed the jury, as matter of law, that they should return a verdict in favor of plaintiff, the only question submitted to them being the amount of the damages. The railway company excepted to this charge, and requested certain specific instructions based upon the theory that the car was out of service and marked 'bad order,' which was notice to Rigsby of its condition; that there was no evidence that the condition of the car had resulted from any \n\n[241 U.S. 33, 37]\n\u00a0\n negligence of defendant; that it was at the time being taken to the shop for repairs; and that for these reasons plaintiff could not recover. The instructions were refused, and exceptions taken. The resulting judgment was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 138 C. C. A. 51, 222 Fed. 221.\n It is insisted that Rigsby was not within the protection of the act because he was not coupling or uncoupling cars at the time he was injured. The reference is to  4 of the act of March 2, 1893, which requires 'secure grab irons or hand holds in the ends and sides of each car for greater security to men in coupling and uncoupling cars.' This action was not based upon that provision, however, but upon  2 of the amendment of 1910, which declares: 'All cars must be equipped with secure sill steps and efficient hand brakes; all cars requiring secure ladders and secure running boards shall be equipped with such ladders and running boards, and all cars having ladders shall also be equipped with secure hand holds or grab irons on their roofs at the tops of such ladders.' There can be no question that a box car having a hand brake operated from the roof requires also a secure ladder to enable the employee to safely ascend and descend, and that the provision quoted was intended for the especial protection of employees engaged in duties such as that which plaintiff was performing.\n It is earnestly insisted that Rigsby was not under the protection of the safety appliance acts because, at the time he was injured, he was not engaged in interstate commerce. By  1 of the 1903 amendment its provisions and requirements and those of the act of 1893 were made to apply 'to all trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce . . . and to all other locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used in connection therewith,' subject to an exception not now pertinent.' And by  5 of the 1910 amendment the provisions of the previous acts \n\n[241 U.S. 33, 38]\n\u00a0\n were made to apply to that act, with a qualification that does not affect the present case. In Southern R. Co. v. United States, \n222 U.S. 20\n, 56 L. ed. 72, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 2, 3 N. C. C. A. 822, which was an action to recover penalties for a violation of the acts with respect to cars some of which were moved in intrastate traffic, and not in connection with any car or cars used in interstate commerce, but upon a railroad which was a part of a through highway for interstate traffic, it was held that the 1903 amendment enlarged the scope of the original act so as to embrace all cars used on any railway that is a highway of interstate commerce, whether the particular cars are at the time employed in such commerce or not. The question whether the legislation as thus construed was within the power of Congress under the commerce clause was answered in the affirmative, the court saying (p. 27): 'Speaking only of railroads which are highways of both interstate and intrastate commerce, these things are of common knowledge: Both classes of traffic are at times carried in the same car, and when this is not the case, the cars in which they are carried are frequently commingled in the same train and in the switching and other movements at terminals. Cars are seldom set apart for exclusive use in moving either class of traffic, but generally are used interchangeably in moving both; and the situation is much the same with trainmen, switchmen, and like employees, for they usually, if not necessarily, have to do with both classes of traffic. Besides, the several trains on the same railroad are not independent in point of movement and safety, but are interdependent, for whatever brings delay or disaster to one, or results in disabling one of its operatives, is calculated to impede the progress and imperil the safety of other trains. And so the absence of appropriate safety appliances from any part of any train is a menace not only to that train, but to others.'\n It is argued that the authority of that case goes no further than to sustain the penal provisions of the act, \n\n[241 U.S. 33, 39]\n\u00a0\n and does not uphold a right of action by an employee injured through a violation of its provisions, unless he was engaged in interstate commerce. That the scope of the legislation is broad enough to include all employees thus injured, irrespective of the character of the commerce in which they are engaged, is plain. The title of the act, repeated in that of each supplement, is general: 'An Act to Promote the Safety of Employees and Travelers,' etc.; and in the proviso to  4 of the supplement of 1910 there is a reservation as to 'liability in any remedial action for the death or injury of any railroad employee.' None of the acts, indeed, contains express language conferring a right of action for the death or injury of an emplouee; for the death or injury of an employee; is their principal object, and the right of private action by an injured employee, even without the employers' liability act, has never been doubted. (See Johnson v. Southern P. Co. \n196 U.S. 1\n, 49 L. ed. 363, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158, 17 Am. Neg. Rep. 412; Schlemmer v. Buffalo, R. & P. R. Co. \n205 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 51 S. L. ed. 681, 684, 27 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 616, 21 Am. Neg. Rep. 466; Delk v. St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. \n220 U.S. 580\n, 55 L. ed. 590, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617; Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Baker, 33 C. C. A. 468, 63 U. S. App. 553, 91 Fed. 224; Denver & R. G. R. Co. v. Arrighi, 63 C. C. A. 649, 129 Fed. 347; Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Voelker, 70 L. R. A. 264, 65 C. C. A. 226, 129 Fed. 522; Chicago Junction R. Co. v. King, 94 C. C. A. 652, 169 Fed. 372.) A disregard of the command of the statute is a wrongful act, and where it results in damage to one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted, the right to recover the damages from the party in default is implied, according to a doctrine of the common law expressed in 1 Comyn's Dig. title, 'Action upon Statute' (f), in these words: 'So, in every case, where a statute enacts or prohibits a thing for the benefit of a person, he shall have a remedy upon the same statute for the thing enacted for his advantage, or for the recompense of a wrong done to him contrary to the said law.' (Per Holt, Ch. J., Anonymous, 6 Mod. 26, 27.) This is but an application of the maxim, \n\n[241 U.S. 33, 40]\n\u00a0\n Ubi jus ibi remedium. See 3 Bl. Com. 51, 123; Couch v. Steel, 3 El. & Bl. 402, 411, 23 L. J. Q. B. N. S. 121, 125, 2 C. L. R. 940, 18 Jur. 515, 2 Week. Rep. 170. The inference of a private right of action in the present instance is rendered irresistible by the provision of  8 of the act of 1893 that an employee injured by any car, etc., in use contrary to the act, shall not be deemed to have assumed the risk, and by the language above cited from the proviso in  4 of the 1910 act.\n Plaintiff's injury was directly attributable to a defect in an appliance which, by the 1910 amendment, was required to be secure, and the act must therefore be deemed to create a liability in his favor, unless it be beyond the power of Congress under the commerce clause of the Constitution to create such a liability in favor of one not employed in interstate commerce. In Illinois C. R. Co. v. Behrens, \n233 \nU.S. 473, 477\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1051, 1054, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 163, the court said, arguendo, with reference to this topic: 'Considering the status of the railroad as a highway for both interstate and intrastate commerce, the interdependence of the two classes of traffic in point of movement and safety, the practical difficulty in separating or dividing the general work of the switching crew, and the nature and extent of the power confided to Congress by the commerce clause of the Constitution, we entertain no doubt that the liability of the carrier for injuries suffered by a member of the crew in the course of its general work was subject to regulation by Congress, whether the particular service being performed at the time of the injury, isolatedly considered, was in interstate or intrastate commerce.' Judicial expressions in previous cases were referred to, and the decision in Employers' Liability Cases (Howard v. Illinois C. R. Co.) \n207 U.S. 463\n, 52 L. ed. 297, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141, was distinguished because the act of June 11, 1906 [34 Stat. at L. 232, chap. 3073], there pronounced invalid, attempted to regulate the liability of every carrier in interstate commerce for any injury to any employee, even though his employment had no relation whatever to interstate commerce. \n\n[241 U.S. 33, 41]\n\u00a0\n The doing of plaintiff's work, and his security while doing it, cannot be said to have been wholly unrelated to the safety of the main track as a highway of interstate commerce; for a failure to set the brakes so as temporarily to hold the 'bad order' cars in place on that track would have been obviously dangerous to through traffic; while an injury to the brakeman had a tendency to cause delay in clearing the main line for such traffic. Perhaps upon the mere ground of the relation of his work to the immediate safety of the main track, plaintiff's right of action might be sustained.\n But we are unwilling to place the decision upon so narrow a ground, because we are convinced that there is no constitutional obstacle in the way of giving to the act in its remedial aspect as broad an application as was accorded to its penal provisions in Southern R. Co. v. United States, supra. In addition to what has been quoted from the opinions in that case and the Behrens Case the following considerations are pertinent. In the exercise of its plenary power to regulate commerce between the states, Congress has deemed it proper, for the protection of employees and travelers, to require certain safety appliances to be installed upon railroad cars used upon a highway of interstate commerce, irrespective of the use made of any particular car at any particular time. Congress having entered this field of regulation, it follows from the paramount character of its authority that state regulation of the subject-matter is excluded. Southern R. Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n236 U.S. 439\n, 59 L. ed. 661, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 304. Without the express leave of Congress, it is not possible, while the Federal legislation stands, for the states to make or enforce inconsistent laws giving redress for injuries to workmen or travelers occasioned by the absence or insecurity of such safety devices, any more than laws prescribing the character of the appliances that shall be maintained, or imposing penalties for failure to maintain them; for the conse- \n\n[241 U.S. 33, 42]\n\u00a0\n quences that shall follow a breach of the law are vital and integral to its effect as a regulation of conduct, liability to private suit is or may be as potent a deterrent as liability to public prosecution, and in this respect there is no distinction dependent upon whether the suitor was injured while employed or traveling in one kind of commerce rather than the other. Hence, while it may be conceded, for the purposes of the argument, that the mere question of compensation to persons injured in intrastate commerce is of no concern to Congress, it must be held that the liability of interstate carriers to pay such compensation because of their disregard of regulations established primarily for safeguarding commerce between the states is a matter within the control of Congress; for unless persons injured in intrastate commerce are to be excluded from the benefit of a remedial action that is provided for persons similarly injured in interstate commerce,-a discrimination certainly not required by anything in the Constitution,-remedial actions in behalf of intrastate employees and travelers must either be governed by the acts of Congress or else be left subject to regulation by the several states, with probable differences in the law material to its effect as regulatory of the conduct of the carrier. We are therefore brought to the conclusion that the right of private action by an employee injured while engaged in duties unconnected with interstate commerce, but injured through a defect in a safety appliance required by the act of Congress to be made secure, has so intimate a relation to the operation of the act as a regulation of commerce between the states that it is within the constitutional grant of authority over that subject.\n It is argued that the statute does not apply except where the car is in use in transportation at the time of the injury to the employee, and that since it does not appear that the car in question was in bad order because of any negligence on the part of the railway company, \n\n[241 U.S. 33, 43]\n\u00a0\n and it was being taken to the shop for repairs at the time of the accident, there is no liability for injuries to an employee who had notice of its bad condition, and was engaged in the very duty of taking it to the shop. This is sufficiently answered by our recent decision in Great Northern R. Co. v. Otos, \n239 \nU.S. 349, 351\n, 60 S. L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 124, where it was pointed out that although  4 of the act of 1910 relieves the carrier from the statutory penalties while a car is being hauled to the nearest available point for repairs, it expressly provides that it shall not be construed to relieve a carrier from liability in a remedial action for the death or injury of an employee caused by or in connection with the movement of a car with defective equipment. The question whether the defective condition of the ladder was due to defendant's negligence is immaterial, since the statute imposes an absolute and unqualified duty to maintain the appliance in secure condition. St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 294\n, 295 S., 52 L. ed. 1061, 1068, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616, 21 Am. Neg. Rep. 464; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 559, 575\n, 55 S. L. ed. 582, 588, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612; Delk v. St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. \n220 \nU.S. 580, 586\n, 55 S. L. ed. 590, 595, 31 Sup. Ct.

State of Idaho \n240 U.S. 136\n (1916) ]\n\n\n[240 U.S. 136, 139]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The case is before us on a motion to dismiss or affirm. The action of the court below which it is sought to review affirmed a judgment of the trial court entered on the verdict of a jury in a suit brought by the state for the use and benefit of O. W. Allen and two hundred and eighteen other named depositors of the Boise State Bank against Platt, a state bank commissioner, and the surety on his bond, for losses alleged to have been suffered by each of the individuals named as the result of alleged neglect of official duty imposed by the state law upon the bank commissioner. The wrong relied upon was his alleged misconduct in not closing the doors of the bank, and permitting it to continue business after he had discovered, as the result of an official examination, that the bank was hopelessly insolvent. The bill as a first cause of action fully set out the facts and stated the legal grounds relied upon to establish the loss and right of O. W. Allen to recover, and separate causes of action were then stated in favor of each of the two hundred and eighteen other depositors. There was an application to remove the case to the district court of the United States on the ground of diverse citizenship, the depositors named being citizens of Idaho, and Platt, the bank commissioner, being then a resident of California, and the Surety Company of Pennsylvania, which application was denied. After issue joined there was a trial before a jury and a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the state, and against the defendants, 'on each and every cause of action set forth in the complaint herein, to and for the use and benefit of each of the parties named in each of the separate causes of action set forth in plaintiff's complaint.' And it was conformably adjudged 'that the said plaintiff do have and recover of and from the said defendants . . . for the \n\n[240 U.S. 136, 140]\n\u00a0\n use and benefit of each of the following-named parties, the sums set opposite their respective names, to wit,' etc. No one of the amounts thus awarded to the plaintiff for the use of any one of the named persons equalled $3,000, but the sum of all the claims equalled $30,000. In affirming the judgment the court below held that the relief prayed was authorized by the state statutes, and that they also conferred authority upon the state to bring the suit as an express trustee for the use and benefit of the respective parties.\n The Federal questions relied upon are, first, the alleged wrongful denial of the right to remove, and second, an asserted error committed by the court below in refusing to sustain a claim under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.\n The first is plainly without merit. Treating the state as the party plaintiff, it is not open to question that there was no right to remove. Stone v. South Carolina, \n117 U.S. 430\n, 29 L. ed. 962, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 799; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Missouri R. & W. Comrs. (Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Hickman) \n183 \nU.S. 53, 58\n, 46 S. L. ed. 78, 80, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 18. And if we were to accede to the contention made in argument that the state must be treated as merely a nominal party, and the right to remove be then determined by the citizenship of the individuals for whose benefit recovery was allowed, it would yet follow, since none of the distinct judgments in favor of any of the individuals are large enough to confer jurisdiction, that the court below correctly held that there was no basis for the right to remove. Woodside v. Beckham, \n216 U.S. 117\n, 54 L. ed. 408, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 367; Troy Bank v. G. A. Whitehead & Co. \n222 U.S. 39\n, 56 L. ed. 81, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 9; Rogers v. Hennepin County, \n239 U.S. 621\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 217. In fact, the correctness of these conclusions is made clear by the arguments advanced to the contrary, since they serve only to confuse and are destructive of each other. Thus, on the one hand, for the purpose of establishing the existence of diversity of citizenship justifying the removal, it is urged that the state must be treated as merely a nominal party, having \n\n[240 U.S. 136, 141]\n\u00a0\n no interest, and as in no wise concerned in the judgment, and then upon the hypothesis that the state is eliminated, in order to establish a jurisdictional amount sufficient to remove, the award of distinct and separate amounts made by the judgment in favor of each of the distinct plaintiffs is wholly ignored, and it is urged that there is but judgment, which is in favor of the state, and which is composed of the aggregate of the distinct amounts.\n Second. The proposition under the 14th Amendment relied upon is that, consistently with that Amendment, the state had not the power to put upon the bank commissioner the duty of closing the bank in case, on examination, it was found to be insolvent, since such authority, consistently with due process, could only have been exerted after judicial proceedings to ascertain the facts, and the awarding of relief accordingly. The pleadings leave it exceedingly doubtful whether the question thus urged was presented in either of the courts below, and it is, besides, obvious from the opinion of the court below that it considered that the only question raised under the Constitution of the United States was a contention that there would result a want of due process if the state statutes conferred upon an administrative officer the authority to liquidate the affairs of the insolvent bank without judicial proceedings. We say this because, in its opinion, the court observed that if that was the contention, it was irrelevant, as the statutes did not authorize liquidation except as a result of judicial proceedings, although they did impose upon the bank commissioner the duty, after he found a bank to be insolvent, to close its doors and prevent the further transaction of business until, in the orderly course of procedure, a judicial liquidation might be accomplished. But assuming, as it is now insisted in argument was the case, that the question relied upon was the repugnancy of the state statute to the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, because \n\n[240 U.S. 136, 142]\n\u00a0\n power was conferred upon an administrative officer in the event of insolvency to close the doors of a bank without awaiting judicial proceedings, and that the observation on that subject by the court below was an adverse decision of such question, we think it suffices to state the proposition to demonstrate its want of merit.

Stat.  3220, 3226, Comp. Stat. 1913,  5944, 5949) by both the parties for a refunding to them of the taxes paid, these suits were commenced to recover the amounts paid on the ground of the repugnancy to the Constitution of the section of the statute under which the taxes had been collected, and the cases are here on direct writs of error to the judgments of the court below, sustaining demurrers to both complaints on the ground that they stated no cause of action.\n Every contention relied upon for reversal in the two cases is embraced within the following propositions: (a) that the tax imposed by the statute was not sanctioned by the 16th Amendment because the statute exceeded the exceptional and limited power of direct income taxation for the first time conferred upon Congress by that Amendment, and, being outside of the Amendment, and governed solely, therefore, by the general taxing authority conferred upon Congress by the Constitution, the tax was void as an attempt to levy a direct tax without apportionment under the rule established by Pollock v.

King, William B. King, and William E. Harvey for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The United States appeals from a judgment awarding the appellee $325, found to be due him under Revised Statutes,  1265, Comp. Stat. 1913,  2104, for half pay as a captain of cavalry of fifteen years' service for a period of three months from August 1 to October 31, 1907, during which time it was found he was absent on leave. The court stated the facts as follows:\n'The claimant, having accepted employment with a commercial company, was granted six months' leave of absence, to take effect January 1, 1907, by 2, Special Orders, No. 305, War Department, dated December 28, 1906, which leave was extended for four months, to take effect July 1, 1907, and to expire October 31, 1907, by 26, Special Orders, War Department, dated June 17, 1907\n\n\n\n'While the claimant was enjoying the extension of his leave of absence, the Adjutant General of the United \n\n[240 U.S. 90, 93]\n\u00a0\n States Army, on July 31, 1907, sent him the following telegram:\n\n\"By direction of the President, although your leave is not revoked, your absence from this date will be without pay.'\n\n'His leave without pay from August 1, 1907, to October 31, 1907, was not requested by the claimant, but he did not file a protest against such action nor relinquish his leave and return to duty.\n\n'The claimant was absent from duty from January 1, 1907, to October 31, 1907. From August 1, 1907, to October 31, 1907, he received no pay. His half pay for said period was $325.' [49 Ct. Cl. 391.]\n\n It is apparent from the authorities cited in the per curiam opinion of the court below (Glavey v. United States, \n182 U.S. 595\n, 45 L. ed. 1247, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891; Whiting v. United States, 35 Ct. Cl. 291, 301; Dyer v. United States, 20 Ct. Cl. 166) that the allowed recovery was based upon the conclusion that the half pay during the leave of absence was expressly sanctioned by law (Rev. Stat.  1265), and hence any condition conflicting with such statutory right was void, and that the officer being entitled to rely upon the statute, no estoppel against him could be implied because of his having acted upon the leave, albeit it contained a condition in conflict with the rights conferred by the statute. To test the merits of these conclusions will dispose of the entire case, since all the contentions of the government are embraced in three propositions: 1, the asserted existence of authority to grant the leave, conditioned on its being without pay, notwithstanding the statute; 2, even if such power did not exist, the binding effect of the condition upon the officer who accepted the leave which was subject to it; and 3, in any event, the impossibility of separating the grant of leave from the condition upon which the leave was based, thus, under the hypothesis of illegality, rendering the grant void, and causing the absence \n\n[240 U.S. 90, 94]\n\u00a0\n from duty which was enjoyed under the apparent sanction of the grant to be an absence without leave, for which, under the statute, no right to pay existed. It is manifest that these contentions assume, as did the conclusions of the court below, that the telegram stated in the findings operated to grant a new leave for the three months therein specified, subject to the condition that it should be without pay, and in separately testing the propositions we shall treat the telegraphic order as having that significance.\n\n 1. \nAs in view of the plain text of Revised Statutes,  1265, there is no room for disputing that the right to half pay during the period of the leave in question was conferred by the statute, there is and can be no dispute that, tested by the statute alone, the court below did not err in allowing the claim for such half pay. But the contention is that error was committed because the conferring of the right to pay by the statute was not exclusive, and therefore did not deprive of the authority as an incident to the power to grant the leave to affix the condition that the leave should be without pay notwithstanding the statute. It is unnecessary, however, to stop to point out the unsoundness of this proposition, since the error upon which it rests is authoritatively demonstrated by previous decisions which substantially leave the proposition not open for discussion. United States v. Williamson, 23 Wall. 411, 416, 23 L. ed. 89, 90; United States v. Wilson, \n144 U.S. 24\n, 36 L. ed. 332, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 539; United States v. Shields, \n153 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 38 S. L. ed. 645, 646, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 735; Glavey v. United States, \n182 U.S. 595\n, 45 L. ed. 1247, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891. Nor, in contemplation of the cases which we have just cited, and additionally, in view of the provision of Revised Statutes ,  1229, Comp. Stat. 1913,  2001, that 'no officer in the military or naval service shall in time of peace be dismissed from service except upon and in pursuance of the sentence of a court-martial to that effect, or in commutation thereof,' is there any necessity to point out the want of application of the authorities dealing with the power to dismiss civil \n\n[240 U.S. 90, 95]\n\u00a0\n officers which are cited as a basis for the proposition that a like power applies to Army officers, and therefore, as there was authority to dismiss, the lesser right of granting the leave without pay necessarily obtained. So, also, it is unnecessary to enter into any detailed analysis of the decision in Hartigan v. United States, \n196 U.S. 169\n, 49 L. ed. 434, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 204, since that case concerned the power to remove a cadet at the Military Academy, and the recognition of the right to exercise that authority was in express terms based upon the view that although in a sense a part of the Army, cadets at the Military Academy were not officers within the intendment of Revised Statutes,  1229, and indeed the opinion in the Hartigan Case in substance refutes the extreme contention as to power which is now sought to be sustained.\n\n 2. \nThe contention as to the estoppel resulting from the failure to protest against the condition affixed to the leave, and the binding force of such condition, even if illegal, resulting from an acceptance of the leave containing it, is by necessary implication foreclosed by all the cases previously cited, and in fact was in express terms considered and held to be without merit in Glavey v. United States, \n182 U.S. 595\n, 45 L. ed. 1247, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 891. Because that case concerned an illegal condition attached to the performance of the duties of an office, and this involves an illegal condition attached to a grant of leave, affords no ground for distinction between that case and this. The basis of the ruling in the Glavey Case was the right of the official to rely upon the provisions of the statute, and the resulting want of power to apply a principle of estoppel. And as here there was express statutory authority for the half pay during the leave, the reason in the Glavey Case is controlling, and the distinction relied upon involves no difference justifying taking this case out of the principle settled in the Glavey case. As the statute conferred the right to the half pay during the leave, it necessarily follows that the exclusion of executive authority over that subject which resulted extended to \n\n[240 U.S. 90, 96]\n\u00a0\n and was coterminous with the power which the statute exerted.\n\n 3. \nThe contention that even if the condition which was attached to the leave be treated as illegal, and the acceptance of the leave containing it be decided not to have operated an estoppel, nevertheless, under such circumstances, the leave must be treated as void, and the absence based on it be held to have been one without leave, for which no pay could be allowed under the statute, is self-contradictory, and besides, in its essence, must rest upon the assumption that there was power to affix the condition, the terms of the statute to the contrary notwithstanding. The contention, therefore, is in substance foreclosed by Glavey v. United States, supra, and the decided cases to which we have previously referred. How completely this is the case will be demonstrated by observing that the decision in the Glavey Case was expressly based on the ground that public policy forbade giving any effect whatever to an attempt to deprive by unauthorized agreement made with an official, express or implied, under the guise of a condition or otherwise, of the right to the pay given by the statute. And, of course, the contention now made that the absence with leave, which carried pay under the statute, was converted into an absence without leave, carrying no pay, in consequence of an unauthorized attempt to subject the granted leave to an illegal provision that it should be without pay, is absolutely in conflict with the previous cases and the rule of public policy upon which they were based. In fact, the contention but in a changed form asserts the application of estoppel, which, as we have seen, was expressly adversely disposed of in the previous cases.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","201":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. ARCHER(1916)\nNo. 112\nArgued: December 7, 1915Decided: May 1, 1916\n\n\n\n Petition in the court of claims for the recover of $300,000 for damages alleged to have been caused by the oppicers and agents of the United States under the authority of an act of Congress creating the Mississippi River Commission by the construction and extending of a dike, known as the Leland dike, upon the land of petitioners, called the Point Chicot plantation.\n A demurrer to the petition was overruled, and after answer and hearing judgment was rendered for claimants in the sum of $54,920, to review which this appeal is prosecuted.\n The findings were necessarily voluminous; we condense them narratively as follows: Claimants' plantation prior to the construction of the levee system to the state of completion which now exists was of great value and in a \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 120]\n\u00a0\n high state of cultivation, being reclaimed lands comparatively free from overflows of the Mississippi river except at intervals, the recurrence of such overflows being so separated in point of time as not to materially affect either the value or the productive capacity of the plantation. It was highly improved with houses and cabins thereon and stocked with laborers and tenants, and yielded large crops.\n It has been overflowed at certain rises of the water in the river ( the rise in feet, according to certain data, is given from 1844 to 1910), and during the twenty years following 1891, after the levee system had been made effective, there were eight years during which it was not overflowed.\n Gauges of the height of the water are taken at Memphis and Greenville. Claimants' plantation is overflowed whenever the water rises to 135 feet, Memphis datum, and it has been more or less overflowed every year except two years (1872 and 1889) during the eighteen years prior to 1891, up to which time the levee system had not been completed sufficiently to withstand great floods and the outlets unclosed; and during the twenty years following 1891, after the levee system had been made effective and the outlets closed by the United States and the local authorities, there were eight years, namely, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1900, 1901, 1902, 1905, and 1910, during which claimants' land was not overflowed.\n The plantation is overflowed at a stage of 38 feet on the Greenville gauge, or whenever the surface water rises to 135 feet, Memphis datum, and the gauge readings show that of the fifteen years from 1882 to 1896, inclusive, there were only four years in which this stage was not exceeded, and that for the fourteen years from 1897 to 1910, inclusive, there were five years in which this stage of 38 feet on the Greenville gauge was not exceeded.\n From time immemorial the waters of the river during its \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 121]\n\u00a0\n highest stages, when not contained within the low-water banks, have naturally found outlets through certain basins (they are mentioned) and through the rivers draining them into the Gulf of Mexico. And the plantations that were not overflowed so frequently before such outlets were closed by levee construction were consequently little injured by overflows.\n Prior to 1883 the state and local authorities constructed a system of levees, miles of which were destroyed in 1882\n\n\n Beginning in 1883 the officers of the United States, under the authority of an act of Congress creating the Mississippi River Commission, and other acts amendatory thereof, adopted the so-called Eads plan, and in consequence thereof have projected and constructed levees on both sides of the river for various distances from Cairo, Illinois, to near the Head of the Passes, a distance of 1,050 miles from Cairo; and the local authorities along the river on both sides from Cairo to the Gulf have before and since also constructed and maintained levees at various places and of various lengths for the purpose of protecting and reclaiming land within their respective districts.\n The levee lines so constructed by the United States and local authorities have been practically joined, with the result of confining the river within a narrow scope, increasing its velocity and elevation and the strength of its current. The highest elevation is approximately 6 feet in times of high water, and the plan of the United States was to increase the scouring power of the water, deepen the channel and improve navigation, and that of the local authorities to reclaim and to protect the land on both sides of the river from overflowing at times of high water.\n From time immemorial the high-water bed of the river has been between the highlands on the east side and the highlands on the west side, and the claimants' plantation is within this boundary; that is, between the highlands on the Mississippi side and the highlands on the Arkansas \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 122]\n\u00a0\n side, and has been occasionally overflowed at times of high water, as stated above, before as well as since the construction of the levees.\n From Cairo to the mouth of the Yazoo river the Mississippi river is practically leveed on both sides, except on the east side, where the highlands about on or very near the river in Kentucky and Tennessee, and there is a gap in the line of levees of 234 miles from the mouth of the Yazoo river to Baton Rouge, unleveed.\n The extension of the levee system has resulted in an increased elevation of the general flood levels which subjects claimants' land to a deeper overflow than they were subjected to formerly, and consequently has somewhat reduced its value for agricultural purposes. The immediate cause of the deeper overflow on claimants' land is the increased elevation of the flood heights, which is the result of the general confinement of the flood discharge by the levee system as a whole.\n During the flood waters of 1882 the levees failed throughout the length of the river. In 1884 the crevasses were still open in all basins. They were open and closed in subsequent years (which are given); they were all closed in 1904 to 1910. In consequence of the closing of the natural basins, outlets, and crevasses, overflowed lands on both sides of the river have been reclaimed and protected from overflow in times of high water and vast benefit has accrued to the states of Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana, but the land of claimants, situated between the levees, and outside thereof, and not protected thereby, has been subjected to repeated overflow, tending to diminish and impair its value, but to what extent does not satisfactorily appear from the evidence.\n A part of the levee system runs back of claimants' plantation, not touching the same, and between it and the plantation is a stretch of ground lower than the main \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 123]\n\u00a0\n body of the plantation, and in periods of high water the water, rising and passing over and upon said land, has, by reason of its lowness, first gone thereupon, and its main current was across said land, and not upon the plantation, which, while in extreme high water it would be flooded, did not have the full force of the current of the river, but was covered in part or in whole by slacker water. The current during highwater seasons struck against the levee back of claimants' plantation, eroding and washing it away, to the great danger of its existence and the inundation of the lands to the rear thereof and diverting the water from the channel of the river. A breach or crevasse in the levee would have entailed damage to it and to the adjacent landowners, and impaired the efficacy of the levee system as projected, constructed, and maintained by the officers of the Mississippi River Commission in accordance with the plans heretofore stated.\n In addition to the danger to the levee, the current, impinging upon the banks of the stream and the neck of the land adjoining Point Chicot to the mainland, cutting into it, threatened to and would have, if permitted to continue, cut through the neck of land, thus straightening the channel and making the plantation an island.\n In order to prevent the threatened danger to the levees and the neck of land, the officers of the United States, acting under the authority of the acts of Congress, and the Mississippi River Commission, constructed what is known as the Leland dike, running diagonally and at an angle from the main line of levee on the Arkansas side across and on the land of claimants to a point 662 feet beyond where the line of the plantation begins, their object being to divert the current of the stream during high waters from impinging upon the levee, and, by throwing it northeastward by the dike, to prevent the destruction of the levee and the cutting across the neck of land.\n The dike first went into and on the land a distance of \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 124]\n\u00a0\n 662 feet, but, its end being exposed to the waters of the river and to its powerful current, the officers deemed it necessary to extend the dike a distance of some 2,700 feet farther upon the land of claimants, and did so extend it in 1907 without any condemnation of the land and with no remuneration therefor being made to claimants. A large part of the soil was used for this construction.\n Before the United States joined the levee lines in accordance with the Eads plan, thus making the same continuous, there were occasional overflows of the plantation, but they have been made deeper and more forceful by the adoption of such system. But before the erection of the dike the overflows did not materially damage the plantation, and it remained still valuable for agricultural purposes. By the extension of the dike the high-water current of the river has been deflected over and across a large part of the plantation, but flows in the same direction as did a portion of the high waters of the river before the erection of the dike,-but with greater force and depth,-the escape of a portion of the high waters over and across the neck of land being thereby prevented, in consequence of which the overflows of the plantation have been greatly increased and intensified, the result of which has been to wash and scour out its top soil and to deposit upon a large part of the plantation great burdens of sand and gravel, and 3,696 acres have been thereby rendered totally unfit for cultivation or any other profitable use. This result has been caused partly by the joining of the levee systems and the erection of said dike, but directly and proximately by the erection of said dike.\n The lines of levees constructed in part by the officers of the United States and in part by the officers and agents of the local organizations of the states bordering on the river to 1909 had a length of 1,548 miles and contained 229,729,354 cubic yards. The officers of the United States constructed 1,050 miles of the total. Since 1909 \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 125]\n\u00a0\n the authorities of the United States have built additional lines of levees containing 2,970,224 cubic yards, and the local authorities lines of levees containing 5,063,427 cubic yards, thus bringing the work of levee construction up to the year 1910.\n The 3,696 acres of land damaged as stated was, at the time of the erection of the dike, of the value of $83,920, and 31 4\/10 acres of the same is actually and wholly occupied by the United States by the construction of the dike, and the balance, to wit, 3,664 6\/10 acres, has been destroyed and rendered wholly unfit for cultivation or any other profitable use. The land is described.\n As an ultimate fact, the court finds, in so far as it is a question of fact, the 3,696 acres of land was somewhat impaired in value by the construction of the levee system, but that its use was totally destroyed by the erection of the Leland dike, and was thereby taken, its value at the time of such destruction and taking being $83,920.\n Before this suit was brought George F. Archer, one of the claimants, brought a suit in the United States circuit court for the western district of Arkansas against the board of levee inspectors of Chicot county, Arkansas, for the damages arising from the erection of said dike and the taking of the 31 4\/10 acres of land. A demurrer by the defendants to the complaint was overruled (128 Fed. 125); and thereafter and before the begining of this suit Archer discontinued the suit brought against the board.\n The ownership of the plantation by the claimants was found. From the findings of fact the court concluded that claimants were entitled to a judgment of $54,920.\n Solicitor General Davis and Robert Szold for appellant. \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 126]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Percy Bell for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna: \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 127]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Upon the findings as thus made the parties to the action base opposing contentions. The government asserts that the government's liability is limited to the land actually taken, and all other damages are consequential. In other words, that the appropriation of the land and the erection of the Leland dike put the government in the position of owner of the land, with the rights and liabilities of owner, and that besides, it had the rights of government to improve navigable waters. There was concession or some concession of the contention by the court of claims in its opinion. The court [47 Ct. Cl. 265], through Mr. Justice Barney, said:\n'In the decision of this case it may be admitted that if the government had owned the site of the Leland dike at the time of its erection, or if it had been owned by a stranger to this suit, and hence had made no invasion upon the lands of the plaintiff, it would not have been liable \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 128]\n\u00a0\n for the destruction thereby inflicted, under the ruling in the Bedford Case, \n192 U.S. 217\n, 48 L. ed. 414, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 238.'\n\n But it was further said: 'Under the decisions of the Supreme Court in all cases of this character, it is the invasion upon the lands and the actual and visible possession which constitutes the taking, and when thus taken, all of the consequences incident to such invasion necessarily follow, among which is the liability to pay for the damage thereby occurring to the balance of the tract to which the land thus taken belongs.' Citing United States v. Grizzard, \n219 U.S. 180\n, 55 L. ed. 165, 31 L.R.A.( N.S.) 1135, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 162.\n Claimants concede the power of the government over the river, and that they 'do not base their claim upon any raising of the flood levels of the Mississippi river, although it is stated by them and was found as a fact by the lower court that the high-water flood level of the Mississippi river had been raised 6 feet by the completion of the general levee system.'\n They 'recognize the fact that the right of the United States government to complete the levee system and maintain the same is indisputable, and that any purely incidental injury which might have resulted to them solely from raising the flood level would be a damnum absque injuria. They claim nothing by reason of said fact, adducing the same merely by way of inducement as showing that the ruin, which would inevitably have come to their plantation from the deflecting thereon of the flood waters by the construction of Leland dike, was merely accelerated and expedited, but not caused, by the raising of the flood level.\n'Their claim is that the deposit of sand and gravel and the destruction of their lands thereby were a direct and immediate result of the construction of the dike which was built on their plantation, using a part of it for the base thereof and the material thereof, and constructing the same without any condemnation of their lands and \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 129]\n\u00a0\n ouster of them therefrom, which, with the destruction, constituted the taking of their lands within the meaning of the 5th Amendment, and entitled them to compensation therefor.'\n\n And they rely on United States v. Grizzard, supra, and other cases, and distinguish the Jackson Case, \n230 U.S. 1\n, 57 L. ed. 1363, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1011, and the Hughes Case, \n230 U.S. 24\n, 57 L. ed. 1374, 46 L.R.A.(N. S.) 624, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1019.\n A serious proposition of law is hence presented by the contentions, and controversy arises, as we have seen, whether an appropriation of the land without condemnation proceedings can have different legal results from its appropriation by such proceedings. In other words, whether compensation for the land appropriated in either case would be the only measure of relief, and its payment or recovery transfer ownership of the land and the rights of ownership.\n But before reaching decision on this proposition questions of fact confront us. It will be observed that the findings are somewhat involved, mixing statement with inference; indeed, it may be said, even with prophecy. And it may be said again (we say 'may be said' to avoid the expression of a definite judgment at this time) that there are effects caused by the United States and effects caused by the state which are not distinguished. We think there should be more precision. Great problems confronted the national and state governments; great and uncertain natural forces were to be subdued or controlled, great disasters were to be averted, great benefits acquired. There might be liability to the individual; if so, the liability should be clear, the cause of it direct and certain. This we explained in Jackson v. United States, \n230 U.S. 1\n, 57 L. ed. 1363, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1011, and in Hughes v. United States, \n230 U.S. 24\n, 57 L. ed. 1374, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 624, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1019. There is an effort in the present case to satisfy these conditions, but we do not think it goes far enough.\n The finding which recites the effects upon claimants' property is as follows: 'In addition to the danger which \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 130]\n\u00a0\n threatened the levee [that is, by the concentration of the current and during seasons of high water], said current, impinging upon the banks of the stream and the neck of land adjoining Point Chicot to the mainland, cutting into it, threatened to and would have, if permitted to continue, cut through said neck of land, thus straightening the channel and making Point Chicot plantation an island.' In other words, it is found that but for the dike the river would have cut through the neck of land. Or, to express it another way, the dike kept the river in its channel. But, as we have seen, many forces were at work, and if the conditions at claimants' plantation were artificial, they were the result of the lawful exercise of power over navigable rivers.\n The finding seems to be definite, but it is too broad in its inference. It may indeed be a just inference, but the elements are wanting upon which a judgment can be with assurance pronounced. Besides, there were two agencies at work, national and state, in the construction of the levees. There is no distribution of liability; all the results to claimants' plantation are assigned to the government. Yet it is found that the claimants at one time conceived that the local authorities were the offenders,-that is, the board of levee inspectors of Arkansas was alone responsible, and brought an action against the board. In passing upon the ground of action and its sufficiency, challenged by demurrer, the court said that the action 'was instituted to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by him [Archer] by reason of the trespass of the defendant [ the board of levee inspectors], who unlawfully, with force and arms, entered upon his premises-a plantation in the county of Chicot-and built a levee thereon, without having made compensation therefor.' The demurrer was overruled, the court expressing the view that the action could be maintained, and intimated an opinion that an injunction might have been granted to enjoin the \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 131]\n\u00a0\n trespass, but that Archer could elect an action for damages.\n The action was discontinued. We are not informed by the findings for what reason. It may have been for good reason; we make no intimation to the contrary; but its commencement and subsequent discontinuance suggest some questions which may lead to answers pertinent to be considered. In that action the trespass upon claimants' plantation by the construction of the Leland dike was attributed to the local levee board; in the action at bar it is ascribed exclusively to the officers of the United States, and it is averred that the encroachment of the trespass was at different times, and to a greater extent the second than the first time. Did claimants object at either time? And if not, why not? Upon the answer may depend a serious legal question. Or, if they were silent, why were they silent? What were the local conditions which called for judgment, not only the general conditions to which we have adverted and the findings describe, but the exact conditions as to claimants' property? Did danger threaten it before the erection of the dike as well as threaten the levees? As we have said, great forces were in operation and a judgment or prediction of their effect might have been difficult and uncertain, and claimants have regarded the dike as a protection to their plantation as well as to the levees.\n The flow of the river is towards the Gulf, and necessarily the water is always higher on the upper side of the reaches or bends such as exist at claimants' plantation. It may be inferred, therefore, that the pressure of the water, compounded of its velocity and volume, is greatest at the recesses or apices of the bends, has its first effect there, but necessarily extends along the whole concave shore. At first, of course, there would be a break at the neck or narrowest part, but would it not successively extend until the whole mass would crumble and a wide breach be \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 132]\n\u00a0\n formed, through which the river would pour with its full eroding force? And that such might be the effect we gather from the report of the United States engineers, of which we take judicial notice. It certainly may be questioned, therefore, whether the river, breaking through at the neck, would have confined itself to a narrow channel, 'making Point Chicot plantation an island,' and would not have permanently submerged it or swept it away. The Leland dike prevented a demonstration of experience, but it would seem that examples elsewhere on the river could give testimony of what would have occurred if the dike had not been constructed. It may be they were adduced, it may be expert testimony was heard and all pertinent facts exhibited to the court, and its finding is a true deduction from the testimony and the facts. We think, however, as we have already said, it is too broad in its inference, and that therefore the case should be remanded to the court for more particular findings on the testimony in the case, or, in the discretion of the court, upon further testimony to be taken; and the case should be given such despatch as may be consistent with such purposes.\n In what we have said no opinion is intended to be expressed of the case as it is presented or may be presented, and all questions of law are reserved.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney, dissenting:\n Being unable to perceive that the facts found by the court of claims are in any material respect lacking in certainty, or are inadequate to support the judgment of that court, I am constrained to record my dissent. \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 133]\n\u00a0\n The salient facts included in the findings are as follows: Claimants' plantation comprises about 6,000 acres, and includes the whole or the greater part of Point Chicot, on the Arkansas side of the Mississippi river. Point Chicot is a peninsula formed by a sweep of the river, being joined at its southwesterly end to the back land by a narrow neck of comparatively low land, which is the property of others than the claimants. The river flows easterly past this neck of land on its upper or northwesterly side, and after flowing around the Point, passing the important town of Greenville, which is on the easterly or Mississippi side, it, of course, flows past the southerly side of the plantation and of the neck of land, on its way to the Gulf. The distance on the course of the river from the upper side of the neck of land to the lower is approximately 13 miles, while the distance across the neck is less than a mile. The situation is clearly shown upon the map annexed to the findings of the court of claims, and reproduced with the report of the case. 47 Ct. Cl. 248, 264.\n The findings show that levee construction work of two different kinds has been in progress along the Mississippi river for more than thirty years. On the one hand, the states and local organizations of the states bordering the river on both sides have, both before and since the year 1883, constructed and maintained certain lines of levees at various places and of various lengths, for the purpose of protecting and reclaiming land within their respective districts from overflow in times of high water. The lands of claimants are not included within any such levee district, and are not affected by any state or local levee construction except as such construction has contributed tributed to closing certain natural outlets that formerly accommodated the flood waters of the river, the result of closing the outlets being to raise the elevation of the river in times of high water. On the other hand, beginning about the year 1883, and continuing to the present time, \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 134]\n\u00a0\n the officers and agents of the United States, in pursuance of an act of Congress creating the Mississippi River Commission and other acts amendatory thereof, and for the improvement of the river for navigation, have adopted the so-called Eads plan, and, in pursuance of it, have projected, constructed, and maintained, and are engaged in constructing and maintaining, certain lines of levees on both sides of the river at various places; the plan being to increase the velocity and scouring power of the water, and thus deepen the channel of the river and improve it for navigation.\n The findings show that 'the extension of the general levee system by the United States and the local authorities has resulted in an increased elevation of the general flood levels, which subjects the claimants' lands to deeper overflow than they were subject to formerly or would be subject to now if the levee system were not in existence, and consequently somewhat reduced its value for agricultural purposes,' and this because 'the lands of claimants, situated between said levees and on the outside thereof, and not protected thereby, have been subjected to repeated overflow, tending to diminish and impair their value, but to what extent does not satisfactorily appear.'\n It is important to observe that for the diminution of the value of claimants' land thus produced by the general effect of levee construction, state and national, no compensation is claimed from the United States, and no part of such diminution is included in the amount of the judgment awarded by the court of claims.\n But it came to pass that 'a part of the levee system so constructed and maintained runs back of said Point Chicot plantation, not touching the same [whether this was a part of the state or of the national system does not appear from the findings, and is quite immaterial, for it was not this that encroached upon claimants' land or caused an actual invasion of it and direct damage to it], \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 135]\n\u00a0\n and that between it and said Point Chicot plantation is a stretch of ground lower than the main body of said plantation [this is the neck of land already mentioned, owned by other parties, and, as the map shows, it extends for nearly a mile from the face of the levee to claimants' nearest boundary line], and in periods of high water, the water rising, passing over and upon said land, has, by reason of its lowness, first gone thereupon, and its main current was across said land, and not upon Point Chicot plantation, which, while in extreme high water it would be flooded as hereinabove set forth, did not have the full force of the current of the Mississippi river thereupon, but was covered in part or in whole by slacker water.\n'The current during high-water seasons (being) as aforesaid struck against and impinged upon the said levee back of said Point Chicot plantation and protecting the lands on the interior, and such impingement resulted in the waters of said river eroding and washing away said levee, to the great danger of its existence, and threatening to break through said levee and inundate said lands to the rear thereof [not claimants' lands] and divert the water from the channel of the river. Such breach or crevasse in said levee would have entailed damage thereunto and to the adjacent landowners [not to claimants], and impaired the efficacy of said levee system as projected, constructed, and maintained by the officers of said Mississippi River Commission in accordance with the plans heretofore stated. In addition to the danger which threatened the levee, said current impinging upon the banks of the stream, and the neck of land adjoining Point Chicot to the mainland, cutting into it, threatened to and would have, if permitted to continue, cut through said neck of land [owned by others than claimants], thus straightening the channel and making Point Chicot plantation an island.'\n\n It is obvious that the straightening of the channel, by permitting the river to make a 'cut-off' at the neck of \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 136]\n\u00a0\n land, would have sent the principal flow of the river through the shorter route, thus interfering with and probably closing navigation along the 13 miles of river around Point Chicot, to the especial detriment of navigation at Greenville. For it is a well-known fact, and a subject of official comment, that when the river forms a new channel for itself across such a neck of land, the old bed has a tendency to fill up at the head and foot and become a lake. There are many crescentshaped lakes in the Mississippi bottom lands, thus caused. Rep. Sec. War, 1875, vol. 2, pt. 2, p. 499. In many cases the entire bed along the former and more circuitous channel has been transformed into dry land, or nearly so. Two historic instances of this kind have given rise to interstate suits now pending on the original docket of this court: No. 6, Original, Arkansas v. Tennessee, turns upon the effect of the 'Centennial Cut-off' of 1876, while in No. 10, Original, Arkansas v. Mississippi, the effect of the cut- off of 1848 is the subject of inquiry. We can thus appreciate the situation, in view of which the powers of the government of the United States were put forth in the taking of a considerable portion of claimants' land, as is shown by the findings that follow.\n In order to prevent the threatened danger to the levees and the neck of land, the officers of the United States, acting under the authority of the acts of Congress, and the Mississippi River Commission, constructed what is known as the Leland dike, running diagonally and at an angle from the main line of levee on the Arkansas side, across and on the land of claimants to a point 662 feet beyond where the line of the plantation begins, their object being to divert the current of the stream during high waters from impinging upon the levee, and, by throwing it northeastward by the dike, to prevent the destruction of the levee, and the cutting across the neck of land. The dike first went into and on the land of \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 137]\n\u00a0\n claimants a distance of 662 feet, but, the end of it being exposed to the waters of the river and to its powerful current, the officers deemed it necessary to extend the dike a distance of some 2,700 feet farther upon the land of claimants, and did so extend it in 1907, without any condemnation of the land and with no remuneration therefor being made to claimants. A large part of the soil was used for the construction of the extension.\n Before the United States joined the levee lines in accordance with the Eads plan, thus making the same continuous, there were occasional overflows of the plantation, but they have been made deeper and more forceful by the adoption of said system. But before the erection of the dike the overflows did not materially damage the plantation and it remained still valuable for agricultural purposes. By the extension of the dike the high-water current of the river has been deflected over and across a large part of the plantation, flowing in the same direction as did a portion of the high waters of the river before the erection of the dike, but with greater force and depth, the escape of a portion of the high waters over and across the neck of land being prevented by the dike, in consequence of which the overflows of the plantation have been greatly increased and intensified, the result of which has been to wash and scour out its top soil and to deposit upon a large part of the plantation great burdens of sand and gravel, and 3,696 acres have been thereby rendered totally unfit for cultivation or any other profitable use. This result had been caused partly by the joining of the levee systems and the erection of the dike, but directly and proximately by the erection of said dike.\n'The 3,696 acres of land hereinbefore mentioned at the time of the erection of the Leland dike was of the value of $83,920. Thirty-one and four-tenths acres of the same is actually and wholly occupied by the United States by the construction of the dike before mentioned, \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 138]\n\u00a0\n and the balance of said 3,696 acres, to wit, 3,664.6, has been destroyed and rendered totally unfit for cultivation or any other profitable use by the owners thereof. . . . The court finds as an ultimate fact, in so far as it is a question of fact, that the said 3,696 acres of land was somewhat impaired in value by the construction of said levee system, but that its use was totally destroyed by the erection of the Leland dike and was thereby taken, its value at the time of such destruction and taking being $83,920.'\n\n Upon these findings, a judgment was rendered in favor of the claimants for $54,920, the difference between this and the total value of the land apparently being represented by an outstanding mortgage.\n The record shows that the case was tried and considered with unusual care and deliberation in the court of claims. The petition was filed July 19, 1909; final judgment was entered February 17, 1914, nunc pro tunc as of February 12, 1912. The merits of the case were argued at least three times, and the United States filed several motions for new trial, for amendment of the findings, etc. It was therefore only after years of contentious litigation that the court of claims arrived at the findings and conclusions upon which it based its judgment.\n In this court the case has been fully argued upon the facts disclosed by the findings; the argument for the government being conducted by the learned Solicitor General in person. It was not suggested in argument that the findings were incomplete or wanting in certainty.\n That the essential facts clearly appear from the findings is evident from the following excerpt from the government's brief:\n'From the findings of the court of claims the following facts appear: The plantation, described as 'Point Chicot plantation,' is situated in Chicot county, in the \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 139]\n\u00a0\n southeastern corner of Arkansas. It is in a bend, bounded on the north, east, and west by the river. Behind the Point Chicot plantation to the south was a levee, a part of the general system constructed by the United States and local authorities after 1883, pursuant to the Eads plan for the improvement of navigation. Between the levee and Point Chicot plantation was a low strip of ground often covered by the river. The natural current of the river in high water seasons, running over the low strip of ground behind the Point Chicot plantation, threatened the destruction of the levee, and a severance of the Point from the mainland, leaving Point Chicot an island. To forestall the danger to the levee from erosion, and to the connecting neck of land, and thus to prevent the river from leaving its channel, agents of the United States government constructed the Leland dike in 1904, running 662 feet into the Point Chicot plantation. In 1907 the dike was extended 2,700 feet further on claimants' land. In all, 31.4 acres were occupied in the construction of the Leland dike. . . . In periods of high water the floods deflected by the dike came over the plantation, rendering 3,696 acres of the plantation unfit for cultivation.'\n\n Even were it suggested, as it is not, that the court of claims had committed some trial error or had drawn improper inferences from the evidence there submitted, this court would have no authority to review the judgment and reverse it upon that ground. The rules established by this court, pursuant to  708, Rev. Stat. (now  243, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1220]), for regulating appeals from the court of claims, require that the record shall contain 'a finding by the court of claims of the facts in the case, established by the evidence, in the nature of a special verdict, but not the evidence establishing them; and a separate statement of the conclusions of law upon said facts on which the court founds its judgment or \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 140]\n\u00a0\n decree.' The findings are conclusive upon this court unless error of law appear in the record. United States v. Smith, \n94 U.S. 214\n, 24 L. ed. 115; Stone v. United States, \n164 U.S. 380\n, 41 L. ed. 477, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 71; District of Columbia v. Barnes, \n197 \nU.S. 146, 150\n, 49 S. L. ed. 699, 700, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 401.\n The entire argument for the government may be reduced to the single contention that its liability for damages is limited to the 31.4 acres of claimants' lands that are actually occupied by the Leland dike, and that the court of claims erred in awarding compensation also for the 3,664.6 acres destroyed by the deflection upon it of the flood waters of the river through the construction and maintenance of the dike. The simple question is whether the case should be governed by United States v. Grizzard, \n219 U.S. 180\n, 55 L. ed. 165, 31 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1135, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 162, upon which the court of claims rested its decision, or by Bedford v. United States, \n192 U.S. 217\n, 48 L. ed. 414, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 238; and Jackson v. United States, \n230 U.S. 1\n, 57 L. ed. 1363, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1011.\n It was attempted to be shown in argument that the causes of the damage to claimants' lands were diverse, it being attributable in part to the levee work of the local and state authorities, and only in part to the construction of the Leland dike by the agents of the United States government. It seems to me that the findings render this matter perfectly clear, for they show that while the general work of levee construction in which local, state, and Federal agencies co-operated resulted in an increased elevation of the flood levels and subjected claimants' land to deeper overflows than before, and consequently somewhat reduced its value for agricultural purposes, no compensation was awarded-indeed, none was or is asked-for this general and consequential result of levee construction. Nor was the judgment in favor of claimants based at all upon the value that claimants' lands would have had but for this levee construction. On the contrary, the finding is explicit that while the tract of 3,696 acres of land was somewhat impaired in value by the construction of the levee system, its use was totally \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 141]\n\u00a0\n destroyed by the subsequent erection of the Leland dike, and that its value at the time of such destruction was $83,920.\n In view of this, I confess myself unable to comprehend the basis of the criticism that the findings lack precision and that the effects of the work done, respectively, by the states and by the United States, ought to be more clearly distinguished. It is not suggested in what respect the findings lack precision, and the government advances no such contention. The findings certainly render it most clear that no compensation is claimed or allowed for anything done by the state or local authorities; that neither of these has invaded the soil of claimants' lands; that this invasion was done solely by agents of the United States government, acting under the authority of acts of Congress, in the execution of an important public work; and that by their acts 31.4 acres were actually occupied for the construction of the dike, and the balance of the 3,696 acres were destroyed as the direct consequence of the effect of the dike in turning the flood waters of the river upon and across claimants' lands in other than their natural course; and this because the dike performed the very function that it was designed to perform.\n Unfavorable reference is made to the finding that, in addition to the danger which threatened the levee, the current, impinging upon the banks of the stream at the neck of land, cut into it, threatening to cut through it and thus straighten the channel and make of Point Chicot plantation an island. I am unable to see in this anything else than a very clear and direct inference based upon the physical facts and the effect of previous floods upon the neck of land as recited in the findings, viewed in the light of a history of cut-offs so frequent and familiar along the lower Mississippi as to have become a matter of common knowledge. But, if the finding is wanting in any respect, this has nothing to do with claimants' right to compensation for the taking of their lands. The \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 142]\n\u00a0\n danger to the neck of land connecting Point Chicot with the mainland does not affect the question of the quantity or value of the land taken from claimants. It bears solely upon the necessity for the taking. Now, the objection of want of necessity may be appropriately raised by an objecting landowner. But surely it does not lie in the mouth of the government, after an actual taking of private property, to answer a claim for compensation by setting up that there was no necessity for taking it.\n It is said that it may be questioned whether the river, breaking through at the neck, would have confined itself to a narrow channel, making Point Chicot plantation an island, and would not have permanently submerged it or swept it away. Plainly, this is wholly speculative; and it seems to me, in view of the findings and the illustrative map, that the result hinted at is not even a remote possibility. The findings are clear to the effect that, before the construction of the dike, flood waters went across the neck of land, to the relief of the Point Chicot plantation, upon which the ground is much higher. The entire width of the river opposite the neck of land and on its upper side is about one-half mile, perhaps less. As already mentioned, the neck is less than a mile across, and it extends for over a mile from the levee to the nearest line of the Point Chicot plantation.\n My bretheren deduce an inference of possible extensive erosion from the reports of the United States engineers. The reports at the utmost would be no more than evidential as to this point. Nor am I aware that this court, in reviewing a judgment of the court of claims, is at liberty to seek contradiction of the express findings of fact made by that court by reference to some government publication of which we may take judicial notice.\n But if, before construction of the Leland dike, there was any probability, near or remote, that the opening of a cut-off at the neck of land would lead to any encroachment \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 143]\n\u00a0\n of the river upon claimants' land, the only possible legitimate effect of this upon their claim for compensation for the lands actually taken and directly damaged by the construction of the dike would be to reduce the damages to such extent as it should be made to appear that by such construction claimants had been specially benefited through the saving of their other lands from destruction. But the burden of showing this was upon defendant, not upon claimants. And I can see no justification for reversing a judgment, fairly recovered by claimants, upon the mere conjecture that possibly there ought to have been an allowance in favor of the United States for the direct benefit that the dike construction conferred upon claimants.\n Reference is made to the fact that before this suit was brought George F. Archer, one of the claimants, brought a suit in the United States circuit court for the eastern district of Arkansas against the board of levee inspectors of Chicot county, Arkansas, for the damages arising from the erection of the dike and the taking of the 31.4 acres of land, and that, after the overruling of a demurrer to the complaint, the action was discontinued before the commencement of this suit (128 Fed. 125 ). As a finding of fact, this manifestly imports nothing whatever pertinent to the right of action of claimants against the government of the United States. As an evidential circumstance, even were it entitled to any weight, this court has nothing to do with it, for we have no jurisdiction to consider or weigh evidence. Even as against the defendant in that action, the discontinued suit would not estop the plaintiff therein; and certainly this court does not intend to intimate that it furnishes any bar to the recovery by the claimants of compensation for the land actually taken by the government of the United States.\n The question whether claimants objected to the entry by the officers of the United States is likewise immaterial, \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 144]\n\u00a0\n for their suit is based, not upon the ground that the officers were trespassers, but upon the ground that they were lawfully engaged in the construction of a public work under governmental authority, and in the doing of it found it necessary to take and did take a considerable part of claimants' land, with incidental direct damage to another and greater part. This, upon well-settled principles, is to be deemed a taking of private property for the public use, and by the plain mandate of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution is to be made the subject of compensation. The protest of the property owner is not necessary to entitle him to compensation. Acquiescence in an unauthorized taking may estop a landowner from having equitable relief by way of injunction against the consequences of the taking, or from treating the taking as a trespass; but it does not disentitle him to compensation for the land actually taken. New York v. Pine, \n185 \nU.S. 93, 96\n, 103 S., 46 L. ed. 820, 821, 825, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592. Nor is the absence of formal condemnation proceedings of any consequence. An agreement on the part of the government to pay him the fair value of his property is necessarily implied, on principles of justice and equity, from the mere act of taking, and it is upon the implied assumpsit that the action rests. United States v. Lynah, \n188 \nU.S. 445, 462\n, 465 S., 468-470, 47 L. ed. 539, 545-549, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 349.\n Stress is laid upon the suggestion that if the government or some third party had owned the site of the Leland dike at the time of its erection, so that in its construction there had been no invasion of the lands of the claimants, the government would not have been liable for the destruction thereby inflicted. It is quite true that the constitutional inhibition against the taking of private property for public use without compensation has been generally construed as not conferring a right to compensation upon a landowner, no part of whose property has been actually invaded, and who has sustained only consequential damages by reason of the erection of a public work upon \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 145]\n\u00a0\n adjoining land owned by a third party. It is this doctrine that underlies the decisions of this court in Bedford v. United States, \n192 U.S. 217\n, 48 L. ed. 414, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 238; and Jackson v. United States, \n230 U.S. 1\n, 57 L. ed. 1363, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1011. The great hardship of the doctrine has been so generally recognized that many of the states have established constitutions providing in substance that private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without compensation. Richards v. Washington Terminal Co. \n233 \nU.S. 546, 554\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1088, 1091, L.R.A.1915A, 887, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 654. A rule so harsh in its operation ought not to be extended; and this case very clearly stands on the other side of the line, and comes within a class of cases quite as well established, of which United States v. Grizzard, \n219 U.S. 180\n, 55 L. ed. 165, 31 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1135, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 162, is an example.\n I cannot yield assent to the suggestion that the taking of the 31.4 acres, actually invaded and occupied by the construction of the dike, can be treated as a matter apart from the destruction of the 3,664.6 acres of claimants' lands immediately adjoining, which, as a direct result of the construction of the dike and because of the function that it performs, have been 'rendered totally unfit for cultivation or any other profitable use by the owners thereof.' Assuming, for the purposes of the argument, that if the government itself, or some stranger, had owned the site of the dike, so that in the erection of it no actual invasion had been made upon claimants' lands, the government would not have been liable on an implied assumpsit for the destruction thereby inflicted, it is sufficient to say that that is not this case. The whole of the lands in question were owned by claimants, and were in use as integral parts of a single plantation. There was an actual invasion and exclusive occupancy of claimants' lands in the construction of the dike, and the destruction of the adjoining lands was a direct and necessary consequence of the use made of the dike, and, in justice, must be regarded as an inseparable part of the taking. It is the established rule, recognized everywhere, that where \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 146]\n\u00a0\n only part of a tract of land is taken, the owner is entitled not merely to the market value of the part taken, but to all damages to the remainder of his tract proximately resulting from the use made of the part actually taken; or, putting it in another way, he is entitled to the difference between the market value of the entire tract and the market value of that which is left; excluding from consideration, however, any general benefit that is shared by all landowners whose property is similarly circumstanced. A multitude of cases might be cited in support of this proposition, but is is not necessary, for they can be found in the text books and cyclopedias. The doctrine has been uniformly adhered to by this court. In Bauman v. Ross, \n167 \nU.S. 548, 574\n, 42 S. L. ed. 270, 283, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 966, it was expressed thus: 'When part only of a parcel of land is taken for a highway, the value of that part is not the sole measure of the compensation or damages to be paid to the owner; but the incidental injury or benefit to the part not taken is also to be considered. When the part not taken is left in such shape or condition as to be in itself of less value than before, the owner is entitled to additional damages on that account. When, on the other hand, the part which he retains is specially and directly increased in value by the public improvement, the damages to the whole parcel by the appropriation of part of it are lessened.' In Sharp v. United States, \n191 \nU.S. 341, 353\n, 354 S., 48 L. ed. 211, 215, 216, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 114, an attempt was made to apply the same rule to separate and independent farms owned by the same owner, and having no necessary relation to each other, the farming on each having been conducted separately, and each farm having its own house and outbuildings. The court said: 'Upon the facts which we have detailed, we think the plaintiff in error was not entitled to recover damages to the land not taken because of the probable use to which the government would put the land it proposed to take. If the remaining land had \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 147]\n\u00a0\n been part of the same tract which the government seeks to condemn, then the damage to the remaining portion of the tract taken, arising from the probable use thereof by the government, would be a proper subject of award in these condemnation proceedings. But the government takes the whole of one tract.' In United States v. Grizzard, \n129 \nU.S. 180, 182\n, 183 S., 55 L. ed. 165, 166, 31 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1135, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 162, which was an action by the owners of a farm for a taking of a part of it by the United States for public purposes, the court said: 'Reference has been made to the well-known class of cases touching an injury to land not taken by the construction of a railroad along and upon an abutting public road, or a change of grade to the damage of adjacent property, and like indirect injuries to the use of property adjacent but of which no part was taken from the owner. Northern Transp. Co. v. Chicago, \n99 U.S. 635\n, 25 L. ed. 336; Sharp v. United States, \n191 U.S. 341\n, 48 L. ed. 211, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 114. But here there has been an actual taking by permanently flooding a part of the farm of the defendants in error. An incident of that flooding is that a public road running across the flooded land is also flooded. But if this were not so, and the roadway had simply been cut off by the interposition of the flooded portion of the farm, the damage would be the same. Since, therefore, there has been a taking of a part of the owners' single tract and damage has resulted to the owners' remaining interest by reason of the relation between the taken part and that untaken, or by reason of the use of the taken land, the rule applied in the cases cited does not control this case. . . . Whenever there has been an actual physical taking of a part of a distinct tract of land, the compensation to be awarded includes not only the market value of that part of the tract appropriated, but the damage to the remainder resulting from that taking, embracing, of course, injury due to the use to which the part appropriated is to be devoted.'\n Bedford v. United States, \n192 \nU.S. 217, 225\n, 48 S. L. ed. 414, 417, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 238, is clearly \n\n[241 U.S. 119, 148]\n\u00a0\n distinguishable, it being an instance of consequential damages to the claimants' land by reason of government operations conducted 6 miles farther up the river. There was no actual invasion of any part of their land, and therefore no responsibility for the consequential damages arising from the government operations. Jackson v. United States, \n230 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1363, 1374, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1011, was likewise a case of consequential damages without actual taking of any part of the claimant's lands. It was decided both in the court of claims (47 Ct. Cl. 579, 613) and by this court upon the authority of the Bedford Case.\n It seems to me that the findings of the court of claims are sufficiently clear and definite to furnish the materials for a proper judgment upon the claim in controversy; that an actual invasion and occupation of a part of claimants' lands, particularly described, by the agents of the United States, in the construction of the dike under the authority of acts of Congress, is shown, as well as the market value of the particular part actually invaded and of the larger and adjacent portion of the same tract necessarily destroyed as a direct and immediate result of the construction and maintenance of the dike. I also think that the case comes clearly within the authority of United States v. Grizzard, supra, and that the judgment under review should be affirmed.\n More than eight years have elapsed since the practical destruction of the greater part of claimants' plantation; nearly seven years since the suit was commenced. And as no interest is allowable against the government in a case of this kind up to the time of the rendition of judgment in the court of claims ( 1091, Rev. Stat.  177, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1141, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1168]; Tillson v. United States, \n100 \nU.S. 43, 47\n, 25 S. L. ed. 543, 544; Harvey v. United States, \n113 U.S. 243\n, 28 L. ed. 987, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465), any unnecessary postponement of the judgment is a virtual denial of justice.\n For these reasons, I dissent. \n\n\n\n","202":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Lewis Benson and George Rice for Louis Hemmer et al.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was brought in the circuit court of the United States, eighth judicial circuit, district of South Dakota, southern division, by the United States, to remove clouds from the title to certain described lands, and to cancel certain instruments purporting to convey the lands, and praying that a certain judgment against the lands be declared no lien thereon, the ground of suit being that the conveyances and the judgment were obtained in opposition to the restrictions upon the alienation or encumbrance of the lands imposed by Congress.\n After issue joined and hearing had the district court, successor of the circuit court, entered a decree in accordance with the prayer of the bill. 195 Fed. 790. The decree was reversed by the circuit court of appeals, and the case remanded to the district court, with directions to dismiss the bill. 123 C. C. A. 194, 204 Fed. 898. This appeal was then prosecuted.\n The facts are the following: One Henry H. Taylor, \n\n[241 U.S. 379, 381]\n\u00a0\n known and designated sometimes as Henry Taylor, is and was during the times with which the suit is concerned a Sioux Indian of the full blood, belonging to and a member of the Santee Sioux Band of Indians, and is not a member of and has never had any connection with the Winnebago Band of Indians.\n On October 7, 1878, Taylor entered upon the lands as a homestead, they being part of the public domain, and subject to entry under the homestead laws of the United States then in force. He established and continued his residence, and made satisfactory proof of all facts required by law.\n On June 6, 1890, a patent was issued to him which recited, among other things, that it was granted upon the express condition that the title conveyed thereby should not be subject to alienation or encumbrance either by voluntary conveyance or by judgment, decree, or order of any court, or subject to taxation of any character, but should remain inalienable and not subject to taxation for the period of twenty years from the date thereof, as provided by act of Congress approved January 18, 1881, 21 Stat. at L. 315, chap. 23. This act applied only to Winnebagoes.\n Taylor continued to own the land until August 8, 1908, when he and his wife made a contract with J. E. Peart, one of the appellees, by which they agreed to convey the land to Peart in fee simple by warranty deed for the sum of $2,400, certain land to be accepted in payment of $550 of such consideration. Time was made the essence of the contract, and it was made binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns of the parties.\n September 8, 1908, Peart assigned the contract to William W. Fletcher, also one of the appellees herein. After this contract Taylor and wife took possession of the land taken in part payment of the consideration, and Peart took possession of the homestead land and paid the consideration in full. \n\n[241 U.S. 379, 382]\n\u00a0\n Taylor and his wife refused to convey the homestead land to either Peart or Fletcher, and the latter instituted suit against them to compel specific performance, which suit resulted in a decree compelling such performance, and a deed was executed to Fletcher by a commissioner appointed by the court.\n February 5, 1909, Fletcher conveyed the land by warranty deed to Louis Hemmer, who, in April, 1909, denied possession to Taylor, who attempted to remove with his family back on the land, and has since denied possession to him.\n June 10, 1909, the United States issued a patent to Taylor which recited that he had established a homestead upon the land in conformity with the act of Congress of July 4, 1884 (hereinafter set out), and that therefore the United States, in consideration of the premises and in accordance with the provisions of said act of Congress, did and would hold the land (it was described) for the period of twenty-five years in trust for the sole use and benefit of Taylor, or for the sole use and benefit of Taylor, or, heirs, according to the laws of the state where the land was located, and at the expiration of that period would convey the same by patent to Taylor, or his widow and heirs, in fee, discharged of the trust and free of all charge or encumbrances whatsoever. It was declared that the patent was issued in lieu of one containing the twenty-year trust clause dated June 6, 1890, which had been canceled.\n In 1894 and in every year since, the county treasurer of Moody county ( appellee Henderson), its auditor (appellee Hornby), and board of county commissioners have assessed the land for taxation and levied taxes against it, and have caused it to be sold, and are asserting the right to tax the same. The other appellees assert interest in the land under tax sales.\n It will be observed that Taylor made his preliminary \n\n[241 U.S. 379, 383]\n\u00a0\n homestead entry October 7, 1878, by virtue of the provisions of the act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. at L. 4201, chap. 131, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4611. The act gave Taylor, as an Indian having the qualifications it described ( that is, who was born in the United States, was twenty-one years of age, the head of a family, and who had abandoned his tribal relations), the benefits of the homestead law, and provided that the title acquired by virtue of its provisions should not be subject to alienation or encumbrance, either voluntarily made or through proceedings in court, and should 'remain inalienable for the period of five years from the date of the patent issued therefor.'\n Taylor, however, did not make his final proof until December 11, 1884, when he paid the final fees and received his final receipt and certificate. Prior to such final proof and compliance with the homestead laws Congress passed the act of July 4, 1884, 23 Stat. at L. 96, chap. 180, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4612. It provided 'that such Indians as may now be located on public lands, or as may, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, or otherwise, hereafter, so locate may avail themselves of the provisions of the homestead laws . . . ; but no fees or commissions shall be \n\n[241 U.S. 379, 384]\n\u00a0\n charged on account of such entries or proofs. All patents therefor shall be of the legal effect and declare that the United States does and will hold the land thus entered for the period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian by whom such entry shall have been made, or in case of his decease, of his widow and heirs according to the laws of the state or territory where such land is located, and that at the expiration of said period the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian, or his widow and heirs as aforesaid, in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or encumbrance whatsoever.'\n Whether the patent to Taylor should have issued under that act and subject to its restriction of twenty-five years, or under the act of 1875, and with a limitation upon alienation of five years, is the controversy in the case. The government contends for the act of 1884, and the contention had the support of the district court. Appellees contend for the application of the act of 1875, and the circuit court of appeals approved the contention. We put to one side the act of 1881, which prescribes a period of nonalienation of twenty years, as it is conceded that the act applied only to Winnebagoes, and Taylor is a Sioux.\n The question in the case, then, is the simple one: Which act applied to and determined Taylor's rights? Or, to state the question differently and at the same time give the test of its solution, Was the act of 1875 repealed or superseded by the act of 1884? There are no repealing words in the latter act, and if it repealed the other act, it must have done so by implication. The implication of such an effect is not favored and the character of the act rejects it. Unquestionably the act of 1884 is the more general, and it has criteria of application different from that of the act of 1875. The acts, therefore, have different objects. Under the act of 1884 Indians located on the \n\n[241 U.S. 379, 385]\n\u00a0\n public lands at the passage of the act, or that might, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, or otherwise, thereafter so locate, might avail themselves of the provisions of the act.\n The act of 1875 was more circumscribed. It did not apply to Indians generally, but to those of special qualifications,-those who had separated themselves from their tribes and the influence of their tribes, who had advanced, therefore, to a higher status and were better prepared to manage their affairs than Indians in general. And it might well have been considered that a five-year restriction upon the alienation of their titles, added to their five years' residence, would give them an appreciation of values sufficient to protect them against the improvidence of their race and the imposition of others.\n Therefore, the acts had no repugnancy, but had different fields of application, and this, it might be contended, even considering their future operation. Of this, however, we need not express opinion. The act of 1884 applied to Indians then located on the public lands. Regarding Taylor simply as an Indian, those words might be considered to be applicable to him; regarding the purpose of the act, which was to confer a benefit, not confirm one, they did not apply to him or to Indians in his situation, for he, and Indians such as he, were the beneficiaries of the prior act, and he and other Indians, it may be,-but certainly he,-had substantially performed its conditions. What remained to be done, and could have been done before the act of 1884 was passed, was not much more than ceremony.\n Nor does the fact that the act of 1884 applied to such Indians as might then be located upon the public lands broaden it so as to include Indians who were proceeding under the act of 1875. The rule is established that under acts of Congress concerning the public lands those are not \n\n[241 U.S. 379, 386]\n\u00a0\n regarded as such to which a claim has attached, though Congress may, if it be so advised, exercise control over them.

Homestead entries under the act of 1875 cannot, therefore, be considered as having been referred to.\n Taylor and those in like situation did not need the aid of the act of 1884. Its language was not of confirmation of rights, but was permissive and prospective, and related to the initiation and acquisition of rights by a different class. And having this definite purpose, it would be difficult to suppose that, besides, rights acquired under prior laws were intended to be limited without reference to such laws. This view makes it unnecessary to inquire whether Taylor's rights had progressed beyond the point of subjection to the power of Congress, he having, as we have said, completed his residence upon the land, and nothing remaining but to make final proof and receive the assurance of his title, which, we have seen, was his situation nearly a year before the passage of the act of 1884\n\n\n Congress has undoubtedly by its legislation indicated a policy to protect Indians against a hasty and improvident alienation of their lands, and the government has cited a number of statutes. But, as we have pointed out, such policy was satisfied by the act of 1875, and we do not think there is anything in the history of the act of 1884 which sustains the contention that it was intended to be an amendment of the act of 1875, or to indicate that the latter act was not sufficiently potent for the purposes of protection. The recommendation of the Interior Department was for the remission of fees, and this was responded to, but confined as we have indicated; and the Interior Department considered it to be so confined, for fees were exacted from Taylor upon his final proof, manifesting \n\n[241 U.S. 379, 387]\n\u00a0\n opinion, within a few months after the passage of the act of 1884, that it did not apply to him.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 15.

Stat. 1913,  8566, amending  4 of the Act to Regulate Commerce [24 Stat. at L. 380, chap. 104], carriers were prohibited from charging more 'for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line or route in the same direction' without obtaining authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission so to do. A period of six months from the passage of the amendment was provided within which carriers might file application for authority to continue charges of that nature then lawfully existing.\n For many years prior to 1910 it had been a common practice to make freight rates from the East to Pacific coast points lower than to intermountain territory, because of competition by the Atlantic-Pacific ocean carriers. About 185 interior cities near the coast had been granted the same transcontinental rates as the ports of San Francisco and Oakland, because the competing water carriers customarily 'absorbed' the local rates or charges from the ports to those cities. Among the interior cities thus treated as 'Pacific Coast Terminals' were Sacramento, Stockton, San Jose, and Santa Clara. The extent to which the higher rates to intermountain territory were justified and the proper basis for 'back haul' rates had been the subject of many hearings before the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Proceeding under  4, as amended, six railroads applied to the Commission under date of December 7, 1910, for relief in respect to west- bound transcontinental commodity rates. The applications, after enumerating the then-existing tariffs, sought authority specifically 'to continue all rates shown in the above-named tariffs from eastern shipping points designated to Pacific coast terminal points,' and generally 'to continue the present method of \n\n[242 U.S. 178, 183]\n\u00a0\n making rates lower at the more distant points than at the intermediate points, such lower rates being necessary by reason of competition of various water carriers' from Atlantic to Pacific ports. After prolonged hearings the Commission entered its so-called 4th section order No. 124, by which, while declining to grant the applications as made, it authorized charging, in some respects, lower rates for the longer hauls. The limitation of such charges was set by a zone system and rate percentage basis prescribed by the Commission, which involved an extensive readjustment of rates; but the existing practice of treating these interior cities as terminals was not disturbed. The validity of the order was attacked by the carriers in the courts, and, after three years of litigation, finally sustained in Intermountain Rate Cases (United States v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co.) \n234 U.S. 476\n, 58 L. ed. 1408, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 986.\n Meanwhile the 'effective date' of the order had been extended by the Commission. After the decision of this court, further extensions of the 'effective date' were sought by the carriers and granted. Some modifications of the order were proposed by the carriers. Additional hearings were had in which many shippers participated. Changes in conditions occurring since the entry of the original order on July 31, 1911, were considered,-among others, that Congress had passed the Act of August 24, 1912 [37 Stat. at L. 568, chap. 390, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8569], giving the Commission jurisdiction over transportation 'by rail and water through the Panama canal;' that the canal itself had been opened on August 15, 1914; that competing ocean rates had been lowered and service improved; and that the ocean carriers had discontinued the practice of 'absorbing' rates from the ports to interior cities. An elaborate supplemental report was made by the Commission on January 29, 1915, and another on April 30, 1915. The propriety of modifications in addition to those proposed by the carriers was shown and a new plan for constructing 'back haul' rates, devel- \n\n[242 U.S. 178, 184]\n\u00a0\n oped by the Commission, was eventually embodied in the amended 4th section order No. 124 of April 30th, 1915, and adopted by the carriers in the tariffs filed thereunder. Following the limitation imposed by the amended order, the tariffs filed confined the low 'terminal' rates to ports of call like San Francisco and Oakland; and the interior coast cities, including Sacramento, Stockton, San Jose, and Santa Clara, were subjected to rates materially higher than San Francisco and Oakland, though much lower than those to intermountain territory.\n Representatives of these four cities, conceiving them aggrieved by the refusal to grant them the same rates as the ports, and alleging that they had participated in whole or in part at hearings which preceded the entry of the last amendment order, applied to the Commission for a rehearing, and when their application was denied, brought this suit in the district court to restrain the enforcement as to them of the amended order, and of the tariffs filed thereunder. The city of Santa Clara and associations representing the traffic interests of Sacramento, Stockton, and San Jose joined as plaintiffs. The United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the six railroads were made defendants. The bill alleged, among other things, that these cities had for a number of years enjoyed the same rates as San Francisco and Oakland; that large industries and other businesses had been established there because they enjoyed terminal rates; that their commercial importance and prosperity would be ruined if the rates were withdrawn; that no changed conditions existed justifying a withdrawal of terminal rates; that they had not been parties to the proceedings in which the orders were made; and that the 'orders authorizing withdrawal of terminal rates' from them were, among other things, 'discriminatory and unjust, were made without said cities having their day in court, or without giving them an opportunity to show the unreasonableness thereof, that \n\n[242 U.S. 178, 185]\n\u00a0\n no justification for such increase was shown, and the order of April 30, 1915, was without evidence, that petitioners have been denied the equal protection of the law and deprived of property without due process of law, to their irreparable damage.'\n The case was heard before three judges; and a final decree was entered which declared that the 'orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission of January 29, 1915, and April 30, 1915, in 4th section applications Nos. 205, 342, 343, 344, 350, and 352,' in so far as they authorize the carriers to charge for the transportation of west-bound transcontinental freight destined to Sacramento, Stockton, San Jose, and Santa Clara, California, 'any greater amount than is concurrently charged for the like carriage of like freight to San Francisco and Oakland, California, were beyond the statutory powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the enforcement thereof should be enjoined; and said orders in the particulars above mentioned are hereby canceled and set aside.' The decree also enjoined and canceled to like extent the tariffs filed in pursuance of such orders. The district court rested its decision that the Commission had no statutory power to enter the amended order upon the ground that an order authorizing higher rates to these interior cities could not legally be entered unless there was an 'application' to it by the carriers for that specific purpose and 'a hearing upon the particular application as in a special case;' that there had been no such application and hearing, and that consequently the orders were void and the tariffs filed in pursuance thereof illegal. Merchants' & Mfrs. Traffic Asso. v. United States, 231 Fed. 292.\n The appeal, in which all the defendants joined, raises important questions involved in the administration of the 4th section as amended June 18, 1910, namely:\n First: Is it essential to the validity of an order au- \n\n[242 U.S. 178, 186]\n\u00a0\n thorizing a lower rate for a longer haul, that it be based upon an application asking only the precise relief granted?\n Second: What is the remedy of a community or shipper which deems itself aggrieved by the order made?\n The orders here in controversy were confessedly based upon applications made by the carriers. Both the amended orders and the decree recite by numbers the applications dated December 7, 1910. The objection made by the appellees is that the limited authority granted by the Commission had not been applied for; since the carriers asked specifically for leave to continue lower rates, which were the same for ports and for interior California cities, but the Commission permitted these rates to ports while it denied like rates to the interior cities. Respondents deny that the district court holds in effect that applications for relief must be granted in toto or denied in toto; but such is the necessary effect of its decision. Amended  4 empowers the Commission 'upon application' to authorize a carrier 'to charge less for longer than for shorter distances.' These carriers asked leave, among other things, to charge on west-bound transcontinental freight to about 193 coast and interior cities much less than to intermountain territory. The Commission permitted them to charge, to eight of these cities which were ports, as much less as the application requested; but as to the other 185, which were interior cities, including the four complaining here, permitted the carriers to charge only somewhat less. In other words, the Commission granted a part of the relief asked. The district court says it had no power so to do. But there is nothing in the act to justify limiting the power of the Commission to either a grant or a denial in toto of the precise relief applied for. Such a construction would make  4 unworkable and defeat the purpose of the amendment. It is at variance with the broad discretion vested in the Com- \n\n[242 U.S. 178, 187]\n\u00a0\n mission and the prevailing practice of administrative bodies. It fails to give effect to the provision that 'the Commission may from time to time prescribe the extent to which such designated common carriers may be relieved from the operation of this section.' It is inconsistent with Intermountain Rate Cases (United States v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co.) \n234 U.S. 476\n, 58 L. ed. 1408, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 986, where the order sustained granted relief very different from that applied for; and it finds no support in United States v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n235 \nU.S. 314, 322\n, 59 S. L. ed. 245, 251, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 113, cited by the district court, in which case relief from the operation of the 4th section had not been granted. The clause in amended 4th section, which declares 'that upon application to the Interstate Commerce Commission such common carrier may in special cases, after investigation, be authorized to charge less for longer than for shorter distances' was designed to guard against the issue, by the Commission, of general orders suspending the long and short haul clause, and to insure action by it separately in respect to particular carriers, and only after consideration of the special circumstances existing. Whenever such consideration has been given, 'the Commission may from time to time prescribe the extent to which such designated common carrier may be relieved from the operation of the section.'\n It may be doubted whether application by the carrier is a prerequisite to the granting of relief. As was said in Intermountain Rate Cases (United States v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co.) \n234 \nU.S. 476, 485\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1408, 1421, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 986,  4 vests in the Commission the 'primary instead of a reviewing function' to determine the propriety of a lesser rate for a longer distance; and  13 declares that the Commission 'shall have the same powers and authority to proceed with any inquiry instituted on its own motion as though it had been appealed to by complaint or petition under any of the provisions of this act, including the power to make and enforce any order or orders in the case, or relating to the matter or thing concerning which inquiry is had, \n\n[242 U.S. 178, 188]\n\u00a0\n excepting orders for the payment of money.' Unless formal application be an indispensable prerequisite to the exercise by the Commission of the power granted by the 4th section, its absence or a defect in it could be waived; and it would be waived by the filing of tariffs under the order entered. For the order is permissive merely. The carrier is the only necessary party to the proceeding under  4. The Commission represents the public. While it is proper and customary for communities or shippers interested to participate in hearings held, there is no provision for notice to them. They are not bound by the order entered; at least, in the absence of such participation. And if the rates made by tariffs filed under the authority granted seem to them unreasonable, or unjustly discriminatory,  13 and 15 afford ample remedy. Respondents contend that, after the amended order was entered and the tariffs filed, they did apply to the Commission for relief, 'but were denied the right of a hearing,' and that 'their protest and demand were ignored and denied.' What they did was to petition for a 'rehearing' in the proceedings under the 4th section, to which they now say they were not parties, instead of applying for redress under  13, as they had a legal right to do. They mistook their remedy. To permit communities or shippers to seek redress for such grievances in the courts would invade and often nullify the administrative authority vested in the Commission; and, as this case illustrates, the attempt of the court to remove some alleged unjust discriminations might result in creating infinitely more. The decree of the district court cancels the amended order and the tariff only so far as it concerns the four complaining cities, and thereby discriminates perhaps most unjustly in their favor as against the other 181 interior cities.\n It was also contended on behalf of the four cities that the amended orders violated the clause added to  4 by \n\n[242 U.S. 178, 189]\n\u00a0\n the Act of June 18, 1910, which provides that 'whenever a carrier by railroad shall in competition with a water route or routes reduce the rates on the carriage of any species of freight to or from competitive points, it shall not be permitted to increase such rates unless after hearing by the Interstate Commerce Commission it shall be found that such proposed increase rests upon changed conditions other than the elimination of water competition.' The answers to this contention are many. What these four cities complain of is not increase of rates, but the fact that San Francisco and Oakland may be given rates lower than theirs; and they strongly deny that water competition has been eliminated. Indeed, it was the increased effectiveness of water competition due to the opening of the Panama canal-a notable change in conditions-which compelled the rate readjustment of which they complain; and the higher rates to the interior cities, made under authority of the Commission, were granted after prolonged hearings, as part of the general readjustment of transcontinental rates. The provision relied upon has no application to such a case.\n The decree of the District Court must be reversed, with directions to dismiss the bill.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","205":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. NEW SOUTH FARM & HOME CO.(1916)\nNo. 808\nArgued: April 7, 1916Decided: April 24, 1916\n\n\n\n Assistant Attorney General Wallace for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. W. Knox Haynes for defendants in error. \n\n[241 U.S. 64, 65]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This writ of error is directed to a decision of the district court, sustaining a demurrer to an indictment, and is prosecuted under the criminal appeals act, it being contended by the government that the decision involved the construction of  215 of the Criminal Code [35 Stat. at L. 1130, chap. 321, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,385]. The opposing contention is that the court passed only on the sufficiency of the indictment as a criminal pleading, and that, therefore, the writ of error should be dismissed. The contentions are repeated here, and make the issue. They necessarily require a consideration of the indictment. It is constituted of three counts. Their foundation is  215, supra, which, so far as material, reads as follows: 'Whoever, having devised . . . any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, . . . shall, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, or attempting so to do, place, or cause to be placed, any letter, . . . circular, . . . or advertisement, . . . in any postoffice, . . . to be sent or delivered by the postoffice establishment of the United States, . . .' etc.\n The section is a somewhat enlarged successor of  5480, Revised Statutes, which provides: 'If any person having devised . . . any scheme or artifice to defraud, . . . shall, in and for executing such scheme or artifice, or attempting so to do, place any letter . . .,' etc.\n As showing a violation of  215, the first count of the indictment charged the following facts, which we state narratively: The individual defendants are directors and stockholders of the New South Farm & Home Company, a corporation engaged in selling approximately 142,000 acres of land, referred to as the Burbank-Ocala colony and \n\n[241 U.S. 64, 66]\n\u00a0\n the Florida-Palatka colony, situated in Putnam, Marion, and Clay counties, Florida. They devised a scheme to defraud certain persons, who were named, and other persons, of their money and property, with the intention to convert the same to the use and gain of the defendants and the corporation, by means of correspondence and communications through the postoffice establishment of the United States, and by means of oral and verbal communications, by offering to sell to such persons, and inducing them to purchase, certain 10-acre farms upon certain terms through false and fraudulent representations concerning the title, fertility, value, drainage, location, environs, and survey of the farms, and the improvements made or to be made thereon.\n The representations were these: The lands and farms were not swampy; the largest ocean steamers operating between New York and Jacksonville could load at Palatka; a family could make enough on one farm during the first year to support itself and save money; three crops a year could be grown; every month in the year was a growing month, that is, some farm or truck product could be raised during each month of the year; the farms were surrounded with orange and citrus fruit groves and vegetable truck farms; the farms had fine roads running through them, were high and well drained, and, on the whole, like the lands of Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois; artesian wells were scattered about on the farms or 'could be obtained by going down 100 feet;' the land was divided into 160-acre tracts; roads were being built around each 160-acre tract and each 10-acre farm would face on a road, and ditches were being dug so that each farm would be drained; many miles of fence had been erected and hundreds of homes and many schoolhouses had been built; the schoolhouses were more than comfortably filled with pupils, and more schools would have to be built to take care of the rapid growth of the colonists settling upon the farms; com- \n\n[241 U.S. 64, 67]\n\u00a0\n fortable hotels had been built upon the lands and farms and improvements of all kinds were going forward at a wonderful rate; lumber was cheap and homes could be built without nearly so great expense as in most places in Florida and at about onehalf of the expense the same would cost in the North; the Title Guarantee Company of Jacksonville, Florida, would guarantee the title, with which company the New South Farm & Home Company had made arrangements so that purchasers might know that their investments were safe; the farms were cut over and ready to go upon at once, and there were no timber leases upon the lands; the defendants were not land brokers or speculators; the New South Farm & Home Company owned the land outright, the title having been approved by the best attorneys, and anyone buying a farm could depend upon securing a clear title, as the company was selling something it owned itself; the farms were free from mosquitoes, malaria, and insects of all kinds and were below the frost line; the company had secured telephone connections with Palatka and with local exchanges at other places (they are named) which would place every farm 'in direct touch with the community at all times;' the lands and farms were located high and dry and in a section well drained; hundreds of people had settled on them and at the little city of Burbank the lands and farms had increased-doubled, trebled, and quadrupled-in price, and the same was true of the lands owned by the company at Silver City, and a thousand settlers were on the lands who could sell them at a large profit; land selling at $ 30 an acre would be worth in two years $200 and $300 per acre; well- stocked stores and factories were located upon the lands, and they were the best located and the most fertile lands in America, and Luther Burbank had been arranged with for 'the exclusive right for the production of certain of his farm products;' there would be installed a Burbank producing \n\n[241 U.S. 64, 68]\n\u00a0\n station on the lands and farms, and the purchasers of the latter would share in the profits of the station, the director of which would be available for the needs of the purchasers; one could get out of a Pullman car on the farms, use a long distance telephone, have the daily paper, rural free delivery, and all the comforts of home.\n There were other representations of fact, and, to give emphasis to those which we have enumerated, it was charged that the pictures in the publications sent out by the defendants represented the true conditions to be seen on the farms.\n All of the representations were explicitly repeated and charged to be false; that defendants well knew them to be so, and intended by them to deceive the persons to be defrauded, and to induce such persons to part with their money and property in the purchase of the farms.\n That the representations were made and communicated by the defendants to the persons intended to be defrauded through and by means of oral statements, circulars, maps, advertisements, photographs, etc., so worded, drawn, constructed, presented, and expressed as to deceive; but all too voluminous to be set forth in the indictment, where fore the grand jurors omitted them.\n That the defendants deposited in the United States mail at Jacksonville and Palatka, in the southern district of Florida, certain publications known as 'The New Florida' and 'Ten Acres and Freedom' and certain other letters, prints, pamphlets, magazines, and publications containing the false representations set out above, which were addressed to the person intended to be defrauded, and on which legal United States postage had been paid.\n The second count charged the defendants with entering into a conspiracy to commit the offense described in the first count, and repeated its allegations and representations, varied only to meet the difference in the crime \n\n[241 U.S. 64, 69]\n\u00a0\n charged. In other words, there were allegations which charged that the conspiracy was to be accomplished by the representations enumerated in the first count, that they were false and known to be so, and made with the same fraudulent purpose, and to be accomplished by the use of the United States mails. Two letters from the company, signed by defendant Seig as president, were set out in the indictment.\n The third count was also like the first in its general charges and designated by name the persons that were intended to be defrauded. The same representations were charged to have been made 'by publishing and causing and procuring to be published divers prints, papers, pamphlets, booklets, circulars, and divers advertisements.' The falsity of the representations was declared, and that the scheme of fraud was to be accomplished by the use of the United States mails. A letter was quoted.\n The defendants demurred to the indictment. The demurrer is a very voluminous document and practically defies condensation. It charges that the indictment does not, nor does any count of it, 'aver and charge any offense against the United States,' that each and every count thereof is insufficient, in that they do not, nor does either of them, aver the facts constituting a scheme to defraud; that each and every count is insufficient for repugnancy, uncertainty, ambiguity, and evasiveness; and that each and every count is insufficient for want of distinct and adequate specifications of the particulars wherein the several representations, called in the count false representations, were false.\n The demurrer then attacks each count separately, and with much elaboration and with repetition of the allegations of the indictment sets out with particularity wherein no offense against the United States was charged.\n The court sustained the demurrer, resting its decision \n\n[241 U.S. 64, 70]\n\u00a0\n upon the second and third grounds of demurrer, which, we have seen, charged that neither the indictment nor any of its counts averred or charged an offense against the United States, or averred facts which constituted a scheme to defraud. It was said, 'The scheme to defraud is alleged in the first and third counts, and the conspiracy count also sets out the same scheme. So that if the scheme to defraud set out in each of said counts is not such a scheme as is punishable under the law, the entire indictment must fail.'\n Describing the representations, the court said they 'are as to the quality of the land, climate, crops to be raised, advantages to be obtained, and promises of improvement, etc.' And further: 'There is no denial of the facts of the ownership of the lands, although there is a denial that all the titles were perfect. Nor is there denial that the land was worth fully as much as was to be obtained therefor. For aught that appears in the indictment, the lands to be obtained were worth fully as much as was to be paid by the parties purchasing; that the parties engaged in the sale were legitimately engaged in the sale of the lands.'\n The court regarded the business as legitimate, and held that the statute was not violated by puffing the qualities of the article sold in advertising it. In other words, as the court expressed it, 'raising the expectations of the purchaser, but giving that purchaser value received for his money, but not fulfilling those expectations,' was not an offense against the statute. And, further, the court said that the deduction from the authorities referred to by counsel 'is that the scheme must be one to defraud the party, or, by false promises, pretenses, etc., deprive him of money or property without adequate value. Mere puffing or exaggeration of qualities, usefulness, opportunities, or value of an article of commerce, where the purchaser gets the article intended to be pur- \n\n[241 U.S. 64, 71]\n\u00a0\n chased, and the value of the article is measured by the price paid, do not constitute the false representations, promises, etc., denounced by the statute.'\n We have made these excerpts from the opinion of the court the better to handle the contentions of the parties, which, as we have seen, are quite accurately opposed, the government asserting that the court construed the statute, and thereby justifying its appeal to this court; the defendants insisting the court construed only the indictment as a pleading, and that therefore this court is without jurisdiction.\n We concur in the view of the government. The court, we think, construed the statute, and misapprehended its import Mere puffing, indeed, might not be within its meaning (of this, however, no opinion need be expressed); that is, the mere exaggeration of the qualities which the article has; but when a proposed seller goes beyond that, assigns to the article qualities which it does not possess, does not simply magnify in opinion the advantages which it has, but invents advantages and falsely asserts their existence, he transcends the limits of 'puffing' and engages in false representations and pretenses. An article alone is not necessarily the inducement and compensation for its purchase. It is in the use to which it may be put, the purpose it may serve; and there is deception and fraud when the article is not of the character or kind represented and hence does not serve the purpose. And when the pretenses or representations or promises which execute the deception and fraud are false, they become the scheme or artifice which the statute denounces. Harris v. Rosenberger (C. C.

Especially is this true in the purchase of \n\n[241 U.S. 64, 72]\n\u00a0\n small tracts for homes, and upon this, if the allegations of the indictment are true, the defendants touched every string of desire by false statements, and sounded every note that could excite and delude. We need not repeat the representations; and they were made graphic, it is alleged, by pictures and photographs.\n Indeed, if it could be admitted that the article offered for sale and its price could be balanced, the one against the other, the price necessarily would be the expression of value, and be constituted of all the attributes of the article, intrinsic and extrinsic; and it needs no comment to show that a 10-acre farm with the character, environments, and facilities described, its price doubling, trebling, and quadrupling within a year, has a seduction more powerful than one not advancing in value, but, it may be, receding; that is, of swampy, not of highland, character, without fertility, hotels, roads, artesian wells, citrus groves, Pullman cars, steamship and other facilities which the literature of defendants describes and the indictment alleges.\n We can entertain no doubt that those employing such representations, if they are false, have engaged in a scheme to defraud. The defendants did not seem to be afraid of repelling by excess, and extravagance was even used in a personal communication. In a letter which was set out in the indictment it was said: 'Our settlers are arriving daily and occupying their farms. The land is being rapidly cleared, crops are being planted, houses erected, stores built, and, on the whole, it is impossible for us to set forth in a letter to you exactly how stupendous is the work that is going on there. Without a question of a doubt the Florida Palatka Colony is enjoying the greatest prosperity.'\n Against these considerations defendants contend that there was, notwithstanding, only a construction of the indictment; but ask that, if we are of a different view, \n\n[241 U.S. 64, 73]\n\u00a0\n the case be reversed only so far as the statute was construed, and remanded for action upon the other causes assigned for demurrer, involving, as they say, the sufficiency of the indictment as a criminal pleading. The difficulty is to indicate a distinction. We can only say we have no intention to control the District Court in its construction of the indictment, and we have no doubt the learned court will be able to adjust its action to this opinion.

Hooper for defendant in error. \n\n[241 U.S. 591, 595]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a prosecution for selling whisky and other intoxicating liquors to an Indian, in violation of the act of January 30, 1897 (chap. 109, 29 Stat. at L. 506, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4137). According to the indictment, the sale was made August 9, 1914, in Tripp county, South Dakota; the Indian was a member of the Sioux Tribe, a ward of the United States, and under the charge of an Indian agent; and the United States was still holding in trust the title to land which had been allotted to him April 29, 1902. A demurrer was sustained and the indictment dismissed on the ground that the statute, in so far as it purports to embrace such a case, is invalid, because in excess of the power of Congress. The case is here on direct writ of error under the criminal appeals act (chap. 2564, 34 Stat. at L. 1246, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1704).\n By the act of 1897 the sale of intoxicating liquor to 'any Indian to whom allotment of land has been made while the title to the same shall be held in trust by the government, or to any Indian a ward of the government under charge of any Indian superintendent or agent, or any Indian, including mixed bloods, over whom the government, through its departments, exercises guardianship,' is denounced as a punishable offense.\n The allotment to this Indian was made from the tribal lands in the Rosebud Reservation, in South Dakota, under the act of March 2, 1889 (chap. 405, 25 Stat. at L. 888), the 11th section of which provided that each allotment should be evidenced by a patent, inaptly so called, declaring that for a period of twenty-five years-and for a further period if the President should so direct-the United States would hold the allotted land in trust for the sole use and benefit of the allottee, or, in case of his death, of his heirs, and at the end of that period would convey the \n\n[241 U.S. 591, 596]\n\u00a0\n same to him or his heirs in fee, discharged of the trust and free of all charge or encumbrance; that any lease or conveyance of the land, or contract touching the same, made during the trust period, should be null and void, and that each allottee should 'be entitled to all the rights and privileges and be subject to all the provisions' of  6 of the general allotment act of February 8, 1887 (chap. 119, 24 Stat. at L. 388, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4195). The act of 1889 recognized the existence of the tribe, as such, and plainly disclosed that the tribal relation, although ultimately to be dissolved, was not to be terminated by the making or taking of allotments. In the acts of March 3, 1899 (chap. 450, 30 Stat. at L. 1362), and March 2, 1907 (chap. 2536, 34 Stat. at L. 1230), that relation was recognized as still continuing, and nothing is found elsewhere indicating that it was to terminate short of the expiration of the trust period.\n By the general allotment act of 1887 provision was made for allotting lands in any tribal reservation in severalty to members of the tribe, for issuing to each allottee a trust patent similar to that just described and with a like restraint upon alienation, and for conveying the fee to the allottee or his heirs at the end of the trust period. Its 6th section, to which particular reference was made in  11 of the act of 1889, declared that, upon the completion of the allotments and the patenting of the lands, the allottees should have 'the benefit of and be subject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the state or territory' of their residence, and that all Indians born in the United States, who were recipients of allotments under 'this act, or under any law or treaty,' should be citizens of the United States, and entitled to all the rights, privileges, and immunities of such citizens. This act, like that of 1889, disclosed that the tribal relation, while ultimately to be broken up, was not to be dissolved by the making or taking of allotments, and subsequent legislation shows repeated instances in which the tribal relation of Indians \n\n[241 U.S. 591, 597]\n\u00a0\n having allotments under the act was recognized during the trust period as still continuing.\n With this statement of the case, we come to the questions presented for decision, which are these: What was the status of this Indian at the time the whisky and other liquors are alleged to have been sold to him? And is it within the power of Congress to regulate or prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquor to Indians in his situation?\n The power of Congress to regulate or prohibit traffic in intoxicating liquor with tribal Indians within a state, whether upon or off an Indian reservation, is well settled. It has long been exercised, and has repeatedly been sustained by this court. Its source is twofold; first, the clause in the Constitution expressly investing Congress with authority 'to regulate commerce . . . with the Indian tribes,' and, second, the dependent relation of such tribes to the United States. Of the first it was said in United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 417-419, 18 L. ed. 182, 185, 186: 'Commerce with the Indian tribes means commerce with the individuals composing those tribes. . . . The locality of the traffic can have nothing to do with the power. The right to exercise it in reference to any Indian tribe, or any person who is a member of such tribe, is absolute, without reference to the locality of the traffic, or the locality of the tribe, or of a member of the tribe with whom it is carried on. . . . This power residing in Congress, that body is necessarily supreme in its exercise.' And of the second it was said in United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375, 383\n, 30 S. L. ed. 228, 231, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1109: 'These Indian tribes are the wards of the nation. They are communities dependent on the United States. . . . From their very weakness and helplessness, so largely due to the course of dealing of the Federal government with them and the treaties in which it has been promised, there arises the duty of protection, and, with it, the power.' \n\n[241 U.S. 591, 598]\n\u00a0\n What was said in these cases has been repeated and applied in many others. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n Of course, when the Indians are prepared to exercise the privileges and bear the burdens of one sui juris, the tribal relation may be dissolved and the national guardianship brought to an end; but it rests with Congress to determine when and how this shall be done, and whether the emancipation shall at first be complete or only partial. Citizenship is not incompatible with tribal existence or continued guardianship, and so may be conferred without completely emancipating the Indians, or placing them beyond the reach of congressional regulations adopted for their protection. \n2\n Thus, in United States v. Holliday, a prosecution for selling spiritous liquor to a tribal Indian in Michigan when not on a reservation, the contention that he had become a citizen was dismissed as 'immaterial;' in Hallowell v. United States, a prosecution for taking whisky upon an allotment held by a tribal Indian in Nebraska, the fact that he had been made a citizen was held not to take the case out of the congressional power or regulation; and in United States v. Sandoval, a prosecution for introducing intoxicating liquors into an Indian pueblo in New Mexico, it was held that whether the In- \n\n[241 U.S. 591, 599]\n\u00a0\n dians of the pueblo were citizens need not be considered, because that would not take from Congress the power to prohibit the introduction of such liquors among them.\n The ultimate question, then, is whether  6 of the act of 1887-the section as originally enacted-was intended to dissolve the tribal relation and terminate the national guardianship upon the making of the allotments and the issue of the trust patents, without waiting for the expiration of the trust period. According to a familiar rule, legislation affecting the Indians is to be construed in their interest, and a purpose to make a radical departure is not lightly to be inferred. Upon examining the whole act, as must be done, it seems certain that the dissolution of the tribal relation was in contemplation; but that this was not to occur when the allotments were completed and the trust patents issued is made very plain. To illustrate: Section 5 expressly authorizes negotiations with the tribe, either before or after the allotments are completed, for the purchase of so much of the surplus lands 'as such tribe shall, from time to time, consent to sell;' directs that the purchase money be held in the Treasury 'for the sole use of the tribe;' and requires that the same, with the interest thereon, 'shall be at all times subject to appropriation by Congress for the education and civilization of such tribe . . . or the members thereof.' This provision for holding and using these proceeds, like that withholding the title to the allotted lands for twenty-five years, and rendering them inalienable during that period, makes strongly against the claim that the national guardianship was to be presently terminated. The two together show that the government was retaining control of the property of these Indians, and the one relating to the use by Congress of their moneys in their 'education and civilization' implies the retention of a control reaching far beyond their property.\n As pointing to a different intention, reliance is had \n\n[241 U.S. 591, 600]\n\u00a0\n upon the provision that when the allotments are completed and the trust patents issued the allottees 'shall have the benefit of and be subject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the state' of their residence. But what laws was this provision intended to embrace? Was it all the laws of the state, or only such as could be applied to tribal Indians consistently with the Constitution and the legislation of Congress? The words, although general, must be read in the light of the act as a whole, and with due regard to the situation in which they were to be applied. That they were to be taken with some implied limitations, and not literally, is obvious. The act made each allottee incapable during the trust period of making any lease or conveyance of the allotted land, or any contract touching the same, and, of course, there was no intention that this should be affected by the laws of the state. The act also disclosed in an unmistakable way that the education and civilization of the allottees and their children were to be under the direction of Congress, and plainly the laws of the state were not to have any bearing upon the execution of any direction Congress might give in this matter. The Constitution invested Congress with power to regulate traffic in intoxicating liquors with the Indian tribes, meaning with the individuals composing them. That was a continuing power of which Congress could not devest itself. It could be exerted at any time and in various forms during the continuance of the tribal relation, and clearly there was no purpose to lay any obstacle in the way of enforcing the existing congressional regulations upon this subject, or of adopting and enforcing new ones, if deemed advisable.\n The act of 1887 came under consideration in United States v. Rickert, \n188 U.S. 432\n, 47 L. ed. 532, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478, a case involving the power of the state of South Dakota to tax allottees under that act, according to the laws of the state, upon their allotments, the permanent improvements thereon, and the \n\n[241 U.S. 591, 601]\n\u00a0\n horses, cattle, and other personal property issued to them by the United States and used on their allotments, and this court, after reviewing the provisions of the act, and saying: 'These Indians are yet wards of the nation, in a condition of pupilage or dependency, and have not been discharged from that condition,' held that the state was without power to tax the lands and other property, because the same were being held and used in carrying out a policy of the government in respect of its dependent wards, and that the United States had such an interest in the controversy as entitled it to maintain a bill to restrain the collection of the taxes.\n In addition to the fact that both acts-the general one of 1887 and the special one of 1889-disclose that the tribal relation and the wardship of the Indians were not to be disturbed by the allotments and trust patents, we find that both Congress and the administrative officers of the government have proceeded upon that theory. This is shown in a long series of appropriation and other acts, and in the annual reports of the Indian Office.\n As, therefore, these allottees remain tribal Indians and under national guardianship, the power of Congress to regulate or prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquor to them, as is done by the act of 1897, is not debatable.\n We recognize that a different construction was placed upon  6 of the act of 1887 in Re Heff, \n197 U.S. 488\n, 49 L. ed. 848, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 506, but, after re-examining the question in the light of other provisions in the act, and of many later enactments, clearly reflecting what was intended by Congress, we are constrained to hold that the decision in that case is not well grounded, and it is accordingly overruled.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

CO.(1916)\nNo. 44\nArgued: October 27, 1916Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 190, 191]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the district court was rendered on the pleadings, the admitted facts of the case being as follows:\n Five employees of the defendant were called to take charge of a wrecking train at 8:10 o'clock P. M., October 29, 1911, but, before they reported at the place of duty, it was ascertained that such train would not be needed, and when they arrived they were notified that their services would not then be required, but that they should report for duty at 10:35 o'clock P. M. the same evening. From 8:10 to 10:35 o'clock they did not render any service 'save that they kept alive the fire in the engine during said period.' At 10:35 o'clock the five men entered upon a freight train run, which, because of hot boxes, was delayed so that it did not arrive at destination until 1:15 o'clock P. M. the next day.\n If the service of the men were considered as beginning at 8:10 o'clock, the hour for which they were called, they were on duty for seventeen hours and five minutes; but if the time were reckoned from 10:35 P. M., when the men actually took charge of the freight train, they were on duty less than sixteen hours. It is admitted that the officials of the railway company believed in good faith that the time of the men should be reckoned from 10:35 P. M., and not from 8:10 P. M., and that, for that reason, when next after October 30th, 1911, they filed their report of employees \n\n[242 U.S. 190, 192]\n\u00a0\n subject to the act who had been kept on duty for a longer period than sixteen hours, the names of the members of this crew were omitted, although the names of many other employees who had been kept on duty longer than the statutory limit were stated in that report.\n It was conceded at the hearing in the circuit court of appeals that the United States had sued the company for the 'forfeitures' prescribed for these excessive services under discussion in this case, and had secured a judgment which had been paid, and that thereby it was determined, for the purposes of this suit, that these employees were on duty from 8:10 o'clock P. M., and therefore for more than sixteen hours.\n The government's claim in the case is for the omission for five days to file the report, and it prays judgment for 'forfeitures' aggregating $ 500, although when the complaint was filed the report claimed to be defective had been on file from November 30th, 1911, to September 14th, 1912, and if the 'forfeitures' of $100 per day prescribed by the law for each day of failure to file a proper report were allowed, the amount of recovery by the government would be $28,900, and it is only by grace of the public officials that the claim in the suit was not for this amount instead of for $500.\n Assistant Attorney General Underwood for petitioner.\n Messrs. Emerson Hadley and Charles W. Bunn for respondent.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Clarke:\n\n Mr. Justice Clarke, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n It will be seen from the foregoing statement of facts that the question presented by the record in this case for decision is: Assuming that the law required that, in the \n\n[242 U.S. 190, 193]\n\u00a0\n report of the company filed on November 30th, 1911, the names of these five employees of the defendant should have been included as having been on duty for more than sixteen hours, and that their names were omitted from that report because it was in good faith believed that their hours of service should be computed from 10:35 o'clock P. M., and that, therefore, they had not been on duty in excess of sixteen hours, is the company liable for the 'forfeitures' prescribed by the statute, judgment for which was prayed for in the complaint?\n Section 20 of the Act to Regulate interstate Commerce of February 4, 1887, as amended June 18, 1910 (36 Stat. at L. 556, chap. 309, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8592), requires the filing of elaborate annual reports by carriers and also the filing of such special reports as the Commission may, by general or special order, require. On the 28th day of June, 1911, the Commission ordered that all carriers subject to the provisions of the act should report 'under oath' within thirty days after the end of each month all instances of employees who had been on duty for a longer time than that required by the act. It is for violation of this order, which has the effect of statute law, that this suit was instituted, it being admitted by the government that the failure to mention these five men in the report by the defendant, filed at the proper time, and which contained a report of many men kept on duty for a period longer than the time allowed by law, was due to the fact that it in good faith believed that these men commenced their time of service at 10:35 instead of at 8:10 o'clock, and that therefore they were not on duty more than the sixteen hours prescribed by the statute. The defendant in error contends that judgment is asked for an omission caused by an honest mistake with respect to a genuinely doubtful case in a report which was properly filed, and this, it is claimed, is not a violation of the law. The statute is a penal one and should be applied only to cases coming plainly within its terms. Providence Steam \n\n[242 U.S. 190, 194]\n\u00a0\n Engine Co. v. Hubbard, \n101 U.S. 188\n, 25 L. ed. 786. While the reports filed must be truthful reports (Yates v. Jones Nat. Bank, \n206 U.S. 158\n, 51 L. ed. 1002, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638), yet, since they must be made under oath, the penalties for perjury would seem to be the direct and sufficient sanction relied upon by the lawmaking power to secure their correctness.\n We are confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that the annual report required of carriers by this same  20 of the act calls for so great an amount of detailed information that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to prepare such a report without making some unintentional omission or mistake, and we cannot bring ourselves to think that Congress intended to punish such an innocent mistake or omission with a penalty of $100 a day.\n There are, to be sure, many statutes which punish violations of their requirements regardless of the intent of the persons violating them; but innocent mistakes, made in reporting facts, where the circumstances are such that candid-minded men may well differ in their conclusions with respect to them, should not be punished by exacting penalties, except where the express letter of the statute so requires; and we conclude that the section under discussion contains no such requirement. In reports in which a mistake is much more likely to prove harmful than in such a report as we have here, the national banking laws punish mistakes only where 'knowingly' made.\n It is argued that if good faith will excuse an omission or a mistaken statement in this report, it will be widely taken advantage of as a cover for making false and fraudulent statements in such reports in the future. Such a prospect seems quite groundless, since many, if not most, criminal laws imposing penalties are made applicable only in cases where corrupt intent or purpose is established to the satisfaction of a court or jury; yet such requirement has not been found in practice to be an encouragement to wrongdoing. \n\n[242 U.S. 190, 195]\n\u00a0\n The fact that the government sues for only one-fifty-seventh part of the forfeitures which had accrued under the construction of the rule and statute contended for by it should make us slow to attribute to Congress a purpose to exact what is thus admitted to be a punishment greatly disproportionate to the offense. Statutes should be construed, as far as possible, so that those subject to their control may, by reference to their terms, ascertain the measure of their duty and obligation, rather than that such measure should be dependent upon the discretion of executive officers, to the end that ours may continue to be a government of written laws rather than one of official grace.\n It being very clear that it is not the purpose of the law under discussion to punish honest mistakes, made in a genuinely doubtful case, the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","208":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Laflin Kellogg, and Abram J. Rose for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The defendant in error and others were indicted for a conspiracy to conceal assets from a trustee in bankruptcy. \n\n[242 U.S. 85, 86]\n\u00a0\n Act of July 1, 1898, chap. 541,  29, 30 Stat. at L. 544, 554, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9585, 9613. The defendant Oppenheimer set up a previous adjudication upon a former indictment for the same offense that it was barred by the one-year statute of limitations in the Bankruptcy Act for offenses against that act,  29d,-an adjudication since held to be wrong in another case. United States v. Rabinowich, \n238 U.S. 78\n, 59 L. ed. 1211, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 682. This defense was presented in four forms entitled respectively, demurrer, motion to quash, plea in abatement, and plea in bar. After motion by the government that the defendant be required to elect which of the four he would stand upon, he withdrew the last- mentioned two, and subsequently the court granted what was styled the motion to quash, ordered the indictment quashed, and discharged the defendant without day. The government brings this writ of error, treating the so-called motion to quash as a plea in bar, which in substance it was. United States v. Barber, \n219 \nU.S. 72, 78\n, 55 S. L. ed. 99, 101, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 209.\n The defendant objects that the statute giving a writ of error to the United states from the decision or judgment sustaining a special plea in bar, when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy, Act of March 2, 1907, chap. 2564, 34 Stat. at L. 1246, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1704, is limited like the earlier clauses to judgments based on the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded. But that limitation expressly in each of the two preceding paragraphs of the statute is not repeated here. The language used in United States v. Keitel, \n211 \nU.S. 370, 399\n, 53 S. L. ed. 230, 245, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 123, had reference only to the construction of the indictment and to its sufficiency upon matters not involving a statute, in cases brought up by the United States under the earlier clauses of the act. That quoted from United States v. Kissel, \n218 U.S. 601\n, 54 L. ed. 1168, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 124, so far as material also meant that the sufficiency of the indictment would not be considered here upon a writ of error to the allowance of a plea in bar. In view of our opinion upon the merits, \n\n[242 U.S. 85, 87]\n\u00a0\n we do not discuss the preliminary objections at greater length.\n Upon the merits the proposition of the government is that the doctrine of res judicata does not exist for criminal cases except in the modified form of the 5th Amendment, that a person shall not be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; and the conclusion is drawn that a decision upon a plea in bar cannot prevent a second trial when the defendant never has been in jeopardy in the sense of being before a jury upon the facts of the offense charged. It seems that the mere statement of the position should be its own answer. It cannot be that the safeguards of the person, so often and so rightly mentioned with solemn reverence, are less than those that protect from a liability in debt. It cannot be that a judgment of acquittal on the ground of the statute of limitations is less a protection against a second trial than a judgment upon the ground of innocence, or that such a judgment is any more effective when entered after a verdict than if entered by the government's consent before a jury is empaneled; or that it is conclusive if entered upon the general issue (United States v. Kissel, \n218 \nU.S. 601, 610\n, 54 S. L. ed. 1168, 1179, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 124), but if upon a special plea of the statute, permits the defendant to be prosecuted again. We do not suppose that it would be doubted that a judgment upon a demurrer to the merits would be a bar to a second indictment in the same words. State v. Fields, 106 Iowa, 406, 76 N. W. 802; Whart. Crim. Pl. & Pr. 9th ed.  406.\n Of course, the quashing of a bad indictment is no bar to a prosecution upon a good one, but a judgment for the defendant upon the ground that the prosecution is barred goes to his liability as matter of substantive law, and one judgment that he is free as matter of substantive law is as good as another. A plea of the statute of limitations is a plea to the merits (United States v. Barber, \n219 \nU.S. 72, 78\n, 55 S. L. ed. 99, 101, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 209), and however the issue was raised in the former case, \n\n[242 U.S. 85, 88]\n\u00a0\n after judgment upon it, it could not be reopened in a later prosecution. We may adopt in its application to this case the statement of a judge of great experience in the criminal law: 'Where a criminal charge has been adjudicated upon by a court having jurisdiction to hear and determine it, the adjudication, whether it takes the form of an acquittal or conviction, is final as to the matter so adjudicated upon, and may be pleaded in bar to any subsequent prosecution for the same offense. . . . In this respect the criminal law is in unison with that which prevails in civil proceedings.' Hawkins, J., in Reg. v. Miles, L. R. 24 Q. B. Div. 423, 431. The finality of a previous adjudication as to the matters determined by it is the ground of decision in Com. v. Evans, 101 Mass. 25, the criminal and the civil law agreeing, as Mr. Justice Hawkins says. Com. v. Ellis, 160 Mass. 165, 35 N. E. 773; Brittain v. Kinnaird, 1 Brod. & B. 432, 129 Eng. Reprint, 789, 4 J. B. Moore, 50, Gow, N. P. 164, 21 Revised Rep. 680. Seemingly the same view was taken in Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 334\n, 59 S. L. ed. 969, 983, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 582, as it was also in Coffey v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 436, 445\n, 29 S. L. ed. 684, 687, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 437.\n The safeguard provided by the Constitution against the gravest abuses has tended to give the impression that when it did not apply in terms, there was no other principle that could. But the 5th Amendment was not intended to do away with what in the civil law is a fundamental principle of justice (Jeter v. Hewitt, 22 How. 352, 364, 16 L. ed. 345, 348) in order, when a man once has been acquitted on the merits, to enable the government to prosecute him a second time.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","209":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

CO.(1916)\nNo. 340\nArgued: Decided: December 11, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 208, 209]\n\u00a0\n On petition of the Pennsylvania Paraffin Works and the Crew-Levick Company the Interstate Commerce Commission made the following order:\n'It is ordered, that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company be, and it is hereby, notified and required to cease and desist, on or before August 15, 1915, and thereafter to \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 210]\n\u00a0\n abstain, from refusing upon reasonable request and reasonable notice therefor to provide and furnish tank cars to the complainants herein for interstate shipments of petroleum products, which refusal has been found in said report to be in violation of the provisions of the act to regulate commerce and amendments thereto.\n\n'It is further ordered, that said defendant be, and it is hereby, notified and required to provide, on or before August 15, 1915, and thereafter to furnish, upon reasonable request and reasonable notice, at complainants' respective refineries, tank cars in sufficient number to transport said complainants' normal shipments in interstate commerce.\n\n'And it is further ordered, that this order shall continue in force for a period of not less than two years from the date when it shall take effect.'\n\n The time of compliance was subsequently extended to November 15, 1915, on which date the railroad company brought this suit to enjoin the enforcement of the order. A preliminary injunction was prayed, and, upon a hearing by three judges, was granted. 227 Fed. 911. To review that action this appeal is prosecuted.\n The Commission made quite elaborate findings, which, however, we do not think it is necessary to quote in full. It found the production of the oil companies, and the following additional facts:\n\n\n (1)\n That 91 per cent of the oil produced by the Paraffin Company was shipped in tanks, 1 1\/2 per cent in barrels loaded in cars other than tank cars, and 7 1\/2 per cent in pipe lines, while of the shipments made by the other company 86.8 per cent moved in tank cars, 4.7 per cent in barrels and 8.5 per cent in pipe lines.\n\n\n (2)\n For a long time the bulk of refined oil in the United States has been shipped in tank cars and at present 91 per cent is so transported. The railroad has been using tank cars for twenty-five years. The capacity of the cars is found, and they are so constructed that they may be rapidly \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 211]\n\u00a0\n loaded at the refineries, and jobbers and dealers in refined oil throughout the country have the proper and necessary facilities for unloading the cars by gravity at their various stations.\n\n\n (3)\n The only other method of transporting oil is in barrels or similar containers, the cost of which is from 3 1\/2 to 3 3\/4 cents a gallon above the cost of transportation in tank cars, and this makes such method of transportation practically prohibitive, and the refusal of the railroad to furnish an adequate supply of tank cars would tend to drive out of business refiners who are unable to supply themselves with enough cars to move their own products; and witnesses for the railroad admitted that tank cars are an economic necessity for the transportation of refined products.\n\n\n (4)\n In 1887 the railroad acquired 1,308 tank cars, some of which have since been sold to independent refiners, but it owned at the time of the hearing 499 cars, of which 482 are furnished to shippers of oil located on its lines.\n\n\n (5)\n At the time of the hearing the Paraffin Company owned 54 tank cars and the Crew-Levick Company 57; and it was testified that these companies for five or six-years have daily made inquiry for the delivery of cars to them, and that formal orders for cars have been constantly on file in the railroad's offices.\n\n\n (6)\n On November 11, 1912, shortly before the filing of the complaints before the Commission, complainants served notice upon the railroad company, requesting it to furnish a sufficient number of tank cars to ship respectively 450,000 gallons of oil per month from the Paraffin Company's refinery at Titusville, and 600,000 gallons per month from the Glade (Crew- Levick Co.) Oil Works at Warren.\n To the request of complainants, the railroad company replied:\n'We beg to say that the railroad company is not pre- \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 212]\n\u00a0\n pared to increase its present tankcar equipment, but is prepared to transport the commodities in question when properly contained in barrels or other similar retainers at rates that are fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory.'\n\n Solicitor General Davis and Mr. Robert Szold for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The question in the case is, Has the Commission the jurisdiction exercised by the order? It is not denied that the Commission has power over the general equipment of a carrier, but it is denied that it has power to require 'vehicles of a special type having no reference to the safety of transportation,' and to this distinction the argument of counsel for the railroad company is addressed.\n The judgment of the district court had somewhat broader basis. The court said: 'The act to regulate com-\n\n\n[242 U.S. 208, 217]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph W. Folk for the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Messrs. John G. Johnson, Thomas Patterson, Frederic D. McKenney, and Henry Wolf Bikle for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.\n Messrs. Charles D. Chamberlin and David Wallerstein for the Crew- Levick Company.\n Messrs. Samuel B. Clarke and Charles W. Atwater as amici curiae.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna: \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 218]\n\u00a0\n merce does not confer upon the Interstate Commerce Commission all power over cars and other instrumentalities of shipment.' And that, aside from special enactments, 'Federal legislation regulating commerce, in so far, at least, as it is contained in the act of 1887 [24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563 ] and its amendments, has thus far left carriers free to exercise their own judgment in the purchase, construction, and equipment of their roads and in the selection of their rolling stock.' Indicating that the law conferred upon the Commission the power to prevent and redress unfair practices and discriminations, the court further said: 'We find nothing in the law which confers upon the Commission power to compel a carrier to acquire facilities it does not possess, or to acquire better facilities than those it possesses, not with the object of preventing discrimination and preferences, but in order that the shipper may have larger, better, and perhaps more economical facilities.'\n And coming to consider the question of power conferred by the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, as amended in 1906 [34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563], the court decided that the amendment 'added nothing to the original duty of the carrier as prescribed by the original act and as interpreted by the Commission, and vested in the Commission no increase of power over cars as instrumentalities of shipment.'\n To this proposition the United States and the Commission oppose the contentions that 'it is the duty of every interstate carrier to provide and furnish upon reasonable request such cars as are reasonably necessary for handling the normal traffic of which it is a common carrier,' and that the Commission is given jurisdiction to enforce the duty.\n The power of the Commission has been given precedence and dominance in the argument, the extent of the duty of carriers coming in secondarily, though important to be considered. In other words, the main question pre- \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 219]\n\u00a0\n sented is, whatever be the duty of carriers as to the equipment they must have or furnish, whether the Interstate Commerce Commission is the tribunal to enforce the duty.\n A comparison of the act as passed in 1887 with the amendment of 1906 becomes necessary, and a consideration of the rulings under the former as an interpreter of the latter.\n The Act of 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8563) provided that--\n'The term 'railroad' as used in this act shall include all bridges and ferries used or operated in connection with any railroad, and also all the road in use by any corporation operating a railroad, whether owned or operated under a contract, agreement, or lease; and the term 'transportation' shall include all instrumentalities of shipment or carriage.'\n\n The word 'transportation' is the crucial word, and its definition in the amendment of 1906 is as follows:\n'. . . and the term 'transportation' shall include cars and other vehicles and all instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage, irrespective of ownership or of any contract, express or implied, for the use thereof and all services in connection with the receipt, delivery, elevation, and transfer in transit, ventilation, refrigeration or icing, storage, and handling of property transported; and it shall be the duty of every carrier subject to the provisions of this act to provide and furnish such transportation upon reasonable request therefor. . . .' And this, it is contended, must be read in connection with  12 as amended March 2, 1889, as follows:\n\n'. . . and the Commission is hereby authorized and required to execute and enforce the provisions of this act.' (25 Stat. at L. 855, 858, chap. 382, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8569, 8576.)\n\n Section 1 of the Act of 1887 came before the Commission for consideration, and the duty thereunder of carriers to furnish tank cars for the transportation of petroleum, in \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 220]\n\u00a0\n Scofield v. Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. 2 I. C. C. Rep. 90, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 67. The opinion is too long to review. It is enough to say of it that it considered the conditions of the oil trade, the different methods of shipping oil in barrels and in tank cars, and stated that the latter method had become established, though very few of the railroads of the country owned tank cars; compared the cost and advantages of the methods, and from this declared that it was obvious that where the carriers did not furnish tank cars, one shipper could not compete in all respects upon equal terms with another shipper who furnished tank cars for the transportation of his oil, unless he also furnished tanks; and, following a former decision, declared that it was properly the business of the carrier to supply the rolling stock for the freight he offers or proposes to carry, and that if the diversities of the traffic are such that this is 'not always practicable, and consignors are allowed to supply it themselves, the carrier must not allow his own deficiencies in this particular to be made the means of putting at an unreasonable disadvantage those who make use in the same traffic of the facilities he supplies.' To prevent such disadvantages or preferences the Commission decided it had power to enforce the duty of supplying cars; it decided it had not the power.\n Section 3 of the act was asserted against the conclusion, and the Commission replied that that section applied only to facilities between connecting lines, and did not embrace car equipment for the origination of freight; and, referring to  1, it was said:\n'The term 'instrumentalities of shipment or carriage,' as found in the first section of the statute, of course includes cars, but they are such cars as are provided by the carrier or used by it in interstate commerce, and the statute nowhere clothes the Commission with power to determine what kind of cars the carrier should use for this purpose and require the carrier to place upon its line for \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 221]\n\u00a0\n use in this business such kind and number of cars as the Commission may decide will constitute a proper and necessary equipment of car service. The duty of every such carrier is none the less obligatory at common law, and by its charter to furnish an adequate and proper car equipment for all the business of this character it undertakes and advertises in its tariffs it will do. The statute does not undertake to clothe the Interstate Commerce Commission with the power by summary proceeding of compelling a railroad company to perform all his common-law duties, but leaves many of these to be enforced in the courts by suits for damages and by other proceedings. . . .\n\n'The power, if it should be held to exist at all, on the part of the Interstate Commerce Commission, to require a carrier to furnish tank cars when that carrier is furnishing none whatever in its business, would apply equally to sleeping cars, parlor cars, fruit cars, refrigerator cars, and all manner of cars as occasion might require, and would be limited only by the necessities of interstate commerce and the discretion of the Interstate Commerce Commission. A power so extraordinary and so vital, reached by construction, could not justly rest upon any less foundation than that of direct expression or necessary implication, and we find neither of these in the statute.'\n\n And it was declared that the lawmaking power had not itself undertaken the responsibility or clothed the Commission with the responsibility of directing a carrier to supply itself with any particular kind of equipment or cars, or, in fact, any equipment or cars at all for the transportation of freight over its line. It will be observed, therefore, that all of the elements that entered into the problem of the power of the Commission and the reasons which seemed to impel its exercise were considered.\n There was a repetition of the elements and decision in Re Transportation & Refrigeration of Fruit, 10 Inters. Com. Rep. 360, 373 ( 1904). It was there said that the Commission was of opinion \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 222]\n\u00a0\n that it was the duty of railroad companies to furnish refrigerator cars for the transportation of fruit; that at one time carriers might have declined to provide this special kind of equipment, but that the trade had so grown that the carriers 'might as well decline to provide stock cars for the transportation of live stock as refrigerator cars for the carriage of perishable commodities.' It was, however, added: 'But this duty does not spring from the act to regulate commerce, nor has this Commission any jurisdiction of that matter. It arises out of the common-law liability of the defendant railway companies as common carriers, and redress for failure to fulfil it must be sought in the courts.'\n Certain abuses were pointed out in that case and the tendency of the ownership of cars by private car lines to monopoly, and as a consequence it was urged upon the Commission that carriers should not be permitted to make exclusive contracts with private car lines like those then under consideration, but should be compelled to provide their own equipment. The Commission replied, at page 377: 'The facts before us call for no expression of opinion on that subject, and none is attempted.'\n This, then, was the view of the Interstate Commerce Commission of the duty of carriers and of its power over them; that is, that it was the duty of carriers to provide and furnish equipment for transportation of commodities, and that this duty might expand with time and conditions, the special car becoming the common car, and the shipper's right to demand it receiving the sanction of law. But the Commission decided it was the sanction of the common law, not of the statute, and that the remedy was in the courts, not in the Commission. With this view we start as the first element of our decision.\n But a change in the statute and remedy is asserted,-a change, it is further asserted, consequent upon a demand for a greater administrative power and remedy. To sus- \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 223]\n\u00a0\n tain the assertions the reports of the Commission are adduced, the legislation it recommended, and the comments of the legislators.\n It is especially to be noted that the amendment of 1906 is in the exact language of the recommendation of the Commission, as far as concerns that part which defines 'railroad' and 'transportation.'\n The Senate committee on interstate commerce had instituted an extended inquiry and members of the Commission appeared before the special committee which had been appointed and presented a bill which the Commissioners said embodied their recommendations, and which the Commission subsequently made part of its 19th annual report. Significant explanations accompanied the bill. It was stated: 'The form of the proposed measure, as will appear upon inspection, is an amendment of certain sections of the present statute. . . . Aside from the main question-the grant of power to the Commission, after hearing, to fix the future rate-several other amendments are proposed with the view of improving the law as a remedial measure, and these amendments will now be referred to under appropriate headings, one of which was as follows:\n'Enlargement of Jurisdiction.\n\n'It will be seen that the changes proposed in the first section are designated (a) to somewhat increase the jurisdiction of the law as to the carriers subject to its provisions and (b) to bring within the scope of the law certain charges and practices which are not now subject to regulation, or respecting which there is dispute as to the power of the Commission. The first purpose is accomplished by leaving out of the first paragraph the phrase 'under a common control, management, or arrangement,' in order to reach certain classes of carriers which are now exempt from the obligations and requirements of the act. The second pur- \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 224]\n\u00a0\n pose is sought to be accomplished by enlarging the definition of the term 'transportation,' so as to include the charges for various services, such as refrigeration and the like, which are now claimed to be beyond our authority. The obligation to furnish and provide the services here referred to is also imposed, which is likewise a point now in dispute. No other changes are proposed in the first five sections of the act, which are commonly spoken of as containing its principal or substantive provisions. In other words, the only amendment suggested in this regard is an enlargement of jurisdiction. In this connection, and as illustrative of the matters here referred to, the subject of refrigeration charges may be properly considered.'\n\n Then follows a consideration of refrigeration charges, the dispute that existed as to whether the shipper or the carrier should bear the expense of refrigeration, and the controversy over the jurisdiction of the Commission. It was said that 'the Congress ought to make that service, by express provision in the law, a part of the transportation itself. We do not at this time recommend that carriers should be prohibited from using private cars or from employing the owners of such cars to perform the icing service if they find that course to their advantage, but we do recommend that these charges should be put on the same basis as all other freight charges. They should be published and maintained the same as the transportation charge, and be subject to the same supervision and control.'\n Under the heading, 'Terminal Roads, Elevator Charges, and Private Cars,' the following was said:\n'It has been suggested that the Congress should prohibit railways from employing any agency or using any facility in the transportation of property which is furnished by the owner of the property. We should hesitate to recommend at this time so drastic a measure as that. \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 225]\n\u00a0\n Assuming that such a law would be a constitutional exercise of authority, it would seriously interfere with property rights which have grown up under the present system. Moreover, there are many instances in which the service can be rendered or the facility furnished more advantageously both to the shipper and railway, and without injury to the public, if provided by the shipper himself.'\n\n After commenting on the amendment to  16 and the added  16a, the Commission explained that--\n'It will thus be seen that the substantial amendments proposed are few in number and easily understood, the remaining changes being merely such as are needful to harmonize other parts of the act with the main amendments . . . In brief, the proposed measure amends certain sections of the act to regulate commerce and is confined to such recommendations as are deemed necessary to effect its intended purpose, and thereby furnish adequate protection against excessive and discriminating charges.'\n\n It will be observed that there is not one word in the report that indicates that there was a necessity or desire for the power exercised in the order under review. Indeed, there was directly expressed an approval of private cars, and the opinion declared that they were a facility which could be furnished more advantageously both to the shipper and the railroad, without injury to the public, if provided by the shipper himself, and the recommendation was that they be brought under the jurisdiction of the Commission and thereby prevent oppressive and discriminatory practices; the principle being, to borrow from another, that all services incident to transportation, whether primary (carrying the goods) or accessorial ( caring for the goods in transit whenever such care calls for special facilities or special equipment), should be subject to the same supervision and regulation. \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 226]\n\u00a0\n But is there anything in the words of the amendment which exhibits on the part of Congress a larger knowledge of conditions than the Commission had, and that Congress, in a broader comprehension and judgment of the conditions and their remedy, gave the Commission a greater jurisdiction than that which in any way occurred to it was necessary?\n The act as it was enacted in 1887 defined the term 'railroad' and the term 'transportation,' the latter as follows: 'And the term 'transportation' shall include all instrumentalities of shipment or carriage.' The definition was very comprehensive, and needed not the mobilization of its denotation; but this subsequently was attempted. Words, indeed, were multiplied-was meaning changed?\n In 1906 the term 'transportation' was defined to 'include cars and other vehicles and all instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage. . . .' The words are not much less general than the words of the Act of 1887. There is no advance made by them or enlargement of meaning. There was simply a useless tautology. But granting it was not and that Congress deemed a special declaration of things to be necessary, such declaration did not alter the relation of the companies to them. The duty which attached to 'instrumentalities' of the Act of 1887 attached to the things covered by its comprehensive generality,-to the things declared in the amendment of 1906, that is, to 'cars,' 'vehicles,' 'facilities.' And this duty under the Act of 1887, we have seen, had, in the opinion of the Commission, the sanction only of the common law. Under the amendment the most that can be said is that the duty is particularized. Its sanction is not enlarged.\n But other words occur which, it is contended, have such effect. These words are: 'And it shall be the duty of every carrier . . . to provide and furnish such transportation upon reasonable request therefor . . .' \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 227]\n\u00a0\n This, however, is but the expression of a necessary implication. It was useless to declare that whatever a carrier must do, he must do 'upon reasonable request.' The duty having been imposed, it necessarily could be demanded. But the expression of the right, if it needed expression, adds nothing of indication to the previous words of the tribunal by which the demand was to be enforced.\n But it is said the duty having explicit declaration, the power to enforce it was found in  12 as amended March 2, 1899, as follows: 'And the Commission is hereby authorized and required to execute and enforce the provisions of this act.' (25 Stat. at L. 855, 858, chap. 382, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8569, 8576.)\n But this casts us back to our general considerations, to which we may only add that there was no question of the duty of carriers either under the Act of 1887 or under the amendment of 1906. It was their duty under both to furnish the instrumentalities of transportation. The question is whether, under the latter, as under the former, jurisdiction to enforce the duty was at common law in the courts, or under the statute and in the Commission; and we have seen that it was the view of the Commission that the remedy was in the courts, and that the amendment of 1906 was not intended to and did not change the remedy. In other words, that Congress in effect accepted the explanation of the Commission and approved its decisions. We repeat, the amendment of 1906 was drawn by and recommended by the Commission, and it may be assumed was not intended to have nor given larger import in the law than it had in the recommendation. United States v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n236 U.S. 318\n, 333, et seq., 59 L.ed. 598, 605, 35 Sup.Ct.Rep. 363.\n There was amendment in 1910 [36 Stat. at L. 550, 551, chap. 309, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8581, 8583], not of  1 in any particular relevant to our discussion, but of  13 and 15. It was said by the committee which reported them for consideration that under  15, as it then stood, the author- \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 228]\n\u00a0\n ity of the Commission to enter an order was 'confined to the subject of rates for transportation and regulations or practices 'affecting such rates,' and the establishment of through routes where 'no reasonable or satisfactory through route exists.\" And the committee added that as recommended to be amended  15 'will have its scope largely increased and the jurisdiction of the Commission will be much enlarged;' and that 'by the amendment the Commission is given jurisdiction to enter orders not only regarding rates, but regarding classifications, regulations, or practices, whether they affect rates or not, and make orders requiring conformity thereto.'\n'Practices' were not otherwise or precisely defined either in the report or in the amendment recommended and as finally passed. Regarding only its broad generality anything may be asserted of it; regarding its context and the conditions which existed, an immediate limitation of it is indicated, made necessary, as we shall presently show.\n\n Section 15 provides that whenever, after full hearing, as provided by  13, the Commission should be of opinion that any individual or joint rates collected by a common carrier or 'that any individual or joint classifications, regulations, or practices whatsoever of such carrier or carriers subject to the provisions' of the act are 'unjust or unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory, or unduly preferential or prejudicial or otherwise in violation of any of the provisions of' the act, the Commission is authorized and empowered to determine and prescribe what shall be the just and reasonable rate or rates and 'what individual or joint classification, regulation, or practice is just, fair, and reasonable,' and make an order that the carrier shall cease and desist from the charging of excessive rates, and shall adopt the classification and conform to and observe the regulation or practice prescribed; the order to continue such time, not exceeding two years, as shall be prescribed by the Commission. \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 229]\n\u00a0\n Applying the section, it is contended that the neglect to provide or certainly the refusal to furnish tank cars is a 'practice,' and became especially so by the reply made by the railroad to the request to furnish them.\n Let us test the contention and see where it takes us. The request was for a special facility, a combination of package and car, and the question, then, is whether the neglect to provide it or to furnish it was a 'practice' within the meaning of  15. The far-reaching effect of an affirmative answer is instantly apparent, and there must be hesitation to declare it from the use of so inapt a word as 'practice.' Following a well- known rule of construction, we must rather suppose its association was intended to confine it to acts or conduct having the same purpose as its associates. And there were many such acts for which the word could provide,- practices which confused the relation of shippers and carriers, burdened transportation, favored the large shipper, and oppressed the small one. These have illustrations in decisions of the Commission. And this was purpose enough, remedied all that was deemed evil in privately owned cars of any type. Beyond that it was not necessary to go; beyond that there were serious impediments to going; and we cannot but believe that if beyond that it was intended to go, there would have been explicit declaration of the intent, with such provision as to notice and time and preparation as its consequences would demand; not ambushed in obscurity and suddenly disclosed by construction to turn accepted custom into delinquency,-a construction that could be disputed and was disputed.\n Three commissioners out of seven dissented, they declaring that if the act conferred power upon the Commission to order a carrier to enlarge its complement of cars it would follow that the Commission had also the power to order enlargement of terminal facilities, increase in the number of locomotives, and extension of tracks or branches. \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 230]\n\u00a0\n In fact, it was said that no facility of transportation would be exempt. The purpose of the provision reviewed was declared to be the regulation of facilities possessed by the carrier, that there should be no unjust discrimination, and the plain intent to be that the shipper should not be required to deal with any other than the carrier. And this, as far as we can glean from the extensive congressional literature, was the end sought. In other words, it was on account of the abuses of the private car system, not in its uses, that legislation was urged.\n There was some sentiment outside of the Commission for the abolition of the private car system, but abolition was not attempted. It would have been a short cut to the solution of the problems and could easily have been accomplished by requiring the railroads to furnish all of the equipment necessary for taking care of all kinds of traffic. But neither the government nor the Commission contends for such an extreme, and to forestall the charge that the order has such tendency represents that the duty of the carrier to furnish special equipment is not absolute, but relative to the conditions of trade and the business of the shipper. This weakens the principle upon which the duty is based. If there be a duty, it would seem necessarily to be universal. And such contention is growing.\n A friend of the court appears in the form of a salt company and presents an argument in support of the order of the Commission and asserts the right to a special equipment for the transportation of salt in bulk.\n Little more need be said. Private cars came into existence as conveniences or necessities to particular businesses, developing by degrees and differentiating according to conditions. It was said in argument that there are different kinds of tank cars for different oils and liquids, and there are cars for live stock, fruit, live poultry, milk, and, as we have seen, salt in bulk. What others there are neither the record nor the argument has given us informa- \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 231]\n\u00a0\n tion, nor the extent of their specialization. However, the information is not needed. The facts of the present case illustrate the condition of the carriers of the country. Describing it, the Commission says:\n'The bulk of the movement of refined oil is in tank cars owned by the shippers. In 1887 the Pennsylvania Railroad acquired 1,308 tank cars, some of which have subsequently been sold to independent refineries. Defendant now owns 499 tank cars, all that remain of those purchased in 1887, and 482 of which are furnished to shippers of oil located on its lines. The other railroads east of the Mississippi river own, in the aggregate, only 303 tank cars. The privately owned tank cars east of the Mississippi aggregate about 27,700, and the total number of tank cars owned in the United States was given as approximately 40,000.'\n\n This, then, was the situation of the railroad, not dissimilar to that of other railroads, not therefore created in deliberate fault, but in accommodation to conditions useful to shippers, advantageous to the railroad, beneficial to the public, as the Commission had declared; and yet a change is suddenly required. The burden of the requirement we shall presently notice.\n Of course, if there is a duty upon a carrier to furnish tank or other special cars upon request, its enforcement cannot be arrested by the burden it imposes; but here again the thought obtrudes, which we have already expressed-it may be to tiresome extent-that if Congress had intended such consequence with all that it implies of expense, directly and indirectly, it would not have left its intention to be evolved from obscure language, but would have put it in explicit declaration and with notice and time for accommodation to it.\n It is to be remembered that the tank car is both package and car, must have special mechanical means of loading and unloading. May these, too, be ordered? Are they \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 232]\n\u00a0\n not a 'method and manner of presenting, marking, packing, and delivering property for transportation,' to use the language of  1, as amended?\n It is difficult to particularize all that the ruling of the Commission implies of power. What of omission or commission in the carrier's relation to the public may not be said to be a practice or practices in the broad sense attempted to be given to those words? A railroad's powers are its duties, bearing, of course, obligations; and all of them by the asserted construction are swept under the jurisdiction of the Commission,-so swept by a single word, not of itself apposite, and determined besides by its association against the contention. This was apparent to the dissenting Commissioners and repelled their concurrence. Well might they have recoiled from going to such extreme upon doubtful implication, and have been impelled to declare, as they did declare, that if such power was given, it logically and necessarily extended to every facility of transportation.\n As to whether this is desirable, we express no opinion, and we only mean now to say that it was not expressed as desirable in the statutes which we have considered, nor was there a word or a line from the Interstate Commerce Commission, so far as the record shows or intimates, of recommendation of such result. Indeed, there is intimation that such result would be radical, and, as said by the railroad company, 'the Safety Appliance Acts indicate that when Congress contemplates the imposition of obligations with respect to the equipment of carriers, it covers the subject by careful, specific rules.' And we may further say with the company that 'it is pertinent to inquire why committees of Congress should consider, as they continue to do from time to time, the wisdom of devolving on carriers the duty to furnish steel coaches for passenger traffic, if already the provisions of the act to regulate commerce are broad enough to cover matters of this kind?' And \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 233]\n\u00a0\n there is strength in the observation of the railroad company that if the argument based upon the word 'practice' or 'practices' were sound, 'it could be contended with equal reason that every detail of railroad operation is a practice within the meaning of the act; why should the Commission ask that it be empowered to require the use of the block signal system? (Report of 1913, page 82.) Why should the Commission make this request if, because of its jurisdiction with respect to practices, it is already endowed with power to regulate the details of operation of carriers?'\n The United States and the Commission insist that they have authority of cases for their two fundamental propositions, to wit:\n\n\n (1)\n That it is the duty of the railroad to furnish equipment for the transportation of products; and (2) that the Commission has the jurisdiction to enforce that duty.\n The authorities upon the first proposition we are not concerned to review. The duty, as far as this question is concerned, may be admitted,- certainly admitted in its general sense. But we need not pause to distinguish its application in the cases to special equipment as distinguished from common equipment, or how much the decisions were based upon the belief of the shipper, justified or encouraged by the railroads, that the equipment required would be furnished.\n With the second proposition we are concerned, and a consideration of the cases becomes necessary, as they are cases in this court and are cited to sustain the power of the Commission. They are as follows: Chicago, R. I . & P. R. Co. v. Hardwick Farmers Elevator Co., \n226 U.S. 426\n, 57 L.ed. 284, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 203, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174; Ellis v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n237 U.S. 434\n, 59 L. ed. 1036, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 645; Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. v. Greenwood Grocery Co., \n227 U.S. 1\n, 57 L. ed. 389, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Harris, \n234 U.S. 412\n, 58 L. ed. 1377, L.R.A.1915E, 942, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 790; Menasha Paper Co. v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., \n241 U.S. 55\n, 60 L. ed. 885, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 501. \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 234]\n\u00a0\n The Hardwick Elevator Case passed upon a law of Minnesota, known as the Minnesota Reciprocal Demurrage Law, which made it the duty of a railroad company on demand from a shipper to furnish cars for transportation at terminal points within forty-eight hours and at intermediate points within seventy-two hours after such demand, Sundays and legal holidays excepted. A penalty was imposed for each day's delay. This court held that by  1 of the Hepburn Act Congress had legislated concerning the delivery of cars in interstate commerce by carriers subject to the act. This was based upon the definitions of  1 of the provisions of  8 and 9. The questions in the case were not those in the present case. The kinds of equipment were not involved nor the questions dependent upon them. The only question was as to whether Congress had entered the field of regulation.\n In Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. v. Greenwood Grocery Co. there was also involved a statute which penalized delays in delivering cars. It was held to be within the decision of the Hardwick Elevator Case, as it undoubtedly was.\n In the Harris Case, the Carmack Amendment [34 Stat. at L. 593, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8592] was decided as not excluding a state statute allowing an attorney's fee in certain actions based on claims for small amounts against railway companies. It has no relevancy to the present case.\n The Ellis Case grew out of a right asserted by the Interstate Commerce Commission to inquire whether Armour & Company, shipping packing- house products in commerce among the states, was controlling the Armour Car Lines and using them as a device to obtain concessions from the published rates for transportation. A series of questions were put to a witness in regard thereto which he refused to answer, and proceedings to compel his testimony were instituted. A question of the power of the Commission was presented and that was made to depend upon whether the Armour Car Lines was a com- \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 235]\n\u00a0\n mon carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act. It was replied that the Car Lines Company had no control over the motive power and movement of the cars and was not a common carrier subject to the act. And this was said: 'It is true that the definition of transportation in  1 of the act includes such instrumentalities as the Armour Car Lines lets to the railroads. But the definition is a preliminary to a requirement that the carriers shall furnish them upon reasonable request, not that the owners and builders shall be regarded as carriers, contrary to the truth.' The language was perfectly apposite to the question under consideration, the relation of the Armour Car Lines to the Armour Company and to the railroad. The cars the latter obtained from the Car Lines Company constituted the equipment of the railroad company and were, of course, subject to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act.\n The question with which the present case is concerned was not presented to the court nor intended to be decided. The testimony sought by the Commission was to expose and prevent what were supposed to be discriminatory practices, and the right to require the testimony depended, it was the effect of the decision, upon the relation of the Armour Company to the Armour Car Lines through the railroad, and whether what was paid to the Armour Car Lines was in effect paid to the Armour Company and made a means of discrimination. This view was rejected and it was said: 'It does not matter to the responsibility of the roads whether they own or simply control the facilities, or whether they pay a greater or a less price to their lessor,'-the lessor of that case being the Armour Car Lines; and, as it was not shown that it was merely the tool of the Armour Company, it had immunity from the investigation. The case, therefore, is not authority for the proposition which it is urged to support.\n Menasha Paper Co. v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co. needs \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 236]\n\u00a0\n no comment. It quotes but attempts no explanation of the words of the statute that is relevant to our present inquiry. Indeed, in all of the cases the points of inquiry and decision were different from the case at bar. They declared or enforced or recognized the general duty of carriers under the particular facts and the law to which the carriers were subject.\n It is next contended by the United States that the railroad has held itself out specifically to carry oil in tank cars, and the fact, it is said, has been found by the Commission and is not reviewable, citing United States v. Louisville & N. R. Co., \n235 \nU.S. 314, 320\n, 59 S. L. ed. 245, 250, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 113. We are unable to assent.\n The railroad company in its answer to the petition before the Interstate Commerce Commission alleged that rule 29 of the official classification No. 39, providing rates for articles in tank cars, stated that the carriers whose tariffs were covered by such classification did not assume any obligation to furnish tank cars. There is a concession in the brief of the Interstate Commerce Commission that such was the published tariff, though contesting its efficacy to devest the company of its duty as a carrier. This might be if there was a duty; but the United States seeks to establish the duty from the offer of the company, and must take the offer as made, and cannot, nor can the Commission, ignore its explicit qualification that the company assumed no obligation to furnish tank cars. The finding of the Commission, therefore, was one of law, and not of fact, and is reviewable.\n The railroad company, besides the contentions of want of power in the Commission to make the order under review, object to it (1) in that it is defective because it requires the company to supply cars for movement over the lines of other carriers; and (2) that it is not administrative in character, but is uncertain, indefinite, and unlawful. \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 237]\n\u00a0\n In support of the first contention the railroad company points out that the company owns more tank cars than all of the other carriers east of the Mississippi river, amounting at the time of the hearing to 499 cars. The total ownership of other cars east of the Mississippi river amounted to 303, and the privately owned tank cars to 27,700. It therefore appears, it is said, that the railroad ownership is less than 3 per cent of the total ownership, and that of this 3 per cent the company is furnishing more than half. The company, therefore, asserts that if it be compelled to furnish all of the tank cars required for the transportation of oil on its line, irrespective of their destination, it is obvious that a burden out of all proportion is placed upon it. It further complains that although the New York Central Railroad serves the oil companies equally with it, no order is made against that company, but, on the contrary, the entire burden is devolved upon it.\n In support of the second contention, the company asserts that the order of the Commission is not administrative is indicated by decisions of this court in actions for failure to furnish cars. The cases are: Louisville & N. R. Co. v. F. W. Cook Brewing Co., \n223 U.S. 70\n, 56 L. ed. 355, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 189 (1912); Eastern R. Co. v. Littlefield, \n237 U.S. 140\n, 59 L. ed. 878, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 489 (1915); Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Puritan Coal Min. Co., \n237 U.S. 121\n, 59 L. ed. 867, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 484 ( 1915); Illinois C. R. Co. v. Mulberry Hill Coal Co., \n238 U.S. 275\n, 59 L. ed. 1306, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 760 (1915).\n Again, it is charged that the order expressed by a legislative principle has the generality of such principle without any criterion of application. The order requires the company to 'provide . . . upon reasonable request and reasonable notice, at complainants' respective refineries, tank cars in sufficient number to transport complainants' normal shipments in interstate commerce.' What is a reasonable request or reasonable notice, and what are normal shipments? The order affords no answer, and if the railroad company ventures, however honestly, \n\n[242 U.S. 208, 238]\n\u00a0\n any resistance to a request or notice not deemed reasonable, or to shipments not deemed normal, it must exercise this right at the risk of a penalty of $5,000 a day against all of its reaponsible officers and agents. These considerations are very serious (International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 U.S. 216\n, 58 L. ed. 1284, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 853; Collins v. Kentucky, \n234 U.S. 634\n, 58 L. ed. 1510, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 924), but the view we have taken of the power of the Commission to make the order, however definite and circumscribed it might have been made, renders it unnecessary to pass upon the contentions.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","210":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. QUIVER(1916)\nNo. 682\nArgued: Decided: June 12, 1916\n\n\n\n Assistant Attorney General Warren for plaintiff in error. \n\n[241 U.S. 602, 603]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George A. Jeffers and Albert G. Granger for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a prosecution for adultery committed on one of the Sioux Indian Reservations in the state of South Dakota. Both participants in the act were Indians belonging to that reservation. The statute upon which the prosecution is founded was originally adopted as part of the act of March 3, 1887 (chap. 397, 24 Stat. at L. 635), and is now  316 of the Penal Code [35 Stat. at L. 1149, chap. 321, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,489]. The section makes no mention of Indians, and the question for decision is whether it embraces adultery committed by one Indian with another Indian, on an Indian reservation. The district court answered the question in the negative.\n At an early period it became the settled policy of Con- \n\n[241 U.S. 602, 604]\n\u00a0\n gress to permit the personal and domestic relations of the Indians with each other to be regulated, and offenses by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian to be dealt with, according to their tribal customs and laws. Thus the Indian intercourse acts of 1796 (chap. 30, 1 Stat. at L. 469), and 1802 (chap. 13, 2 Stat. at L. 139), provided for the punishment of various offenses by white persons against Indians and by Indians against white persons, but left untouched those by Indians against each other; and the act of 1834 (chap. 161, 4 Stat. at L. 729, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4148), while providing that 'so much of the laws of the United States as provides for the punishment of crimes committed within any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States shall be in force in the Indian country,' qualified its action by saying, 'the same shall not extend to crimes committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian.' That provision with its qualification was later carried into the Revised Statutes as  2145 and 2146, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4148, 4149. This was the situation when this court, in Ex parte Crow Dog (Ex parte Kang-Gi-Shun-Ca) \n109 U.S. 556\n, 27 L. ed. 1030, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 396, held that the murder of an Indian by another Indian, on an Indian reservation, was not punishable under the laws of the United States, and could be dealt with only according to the laws of the tribe. The first change came when, by the act of March 3, 1885 (chap. 341,  9, 23 Stat. at L. 385, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,502), now  328 of the Penal Code, Congress provided for the punishment of murder, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to kill, assault with a dangerous weapon, arson, burglary, and larceny, when committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian. In other respects the policy remained as before. After South Dakota became a state, Congress, acting upon a partial cession of jurisdiction by that state (chap. 106, Laws 1901), provided by the act of February 2, 1903, (chap. 351 32 Stat. at L. 793, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10, 503), now  329 of the Penal Code, for the punishment of the particular offenses named in the act of 1885 when \n\n[241 U.S. 602, 605]\n\u00a0\n committed on the Indian reservations in that state, even though committed by others than Indians; but this is without bearing here, for it left the situation in respect of offenses by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian as it was after the act of 1885\n\n\n We have now referred to all the statutes. There is none dealing with bigamy, polygamy, incest, adultery, or fornication, which in terms refers to Indians, these matters always having been left to the tribal customs and laws, and to such preventive and corrective measures as reasonably could be taken by the administrative officers.\n But counsel for the government invite attention to the letter of the statute, and urge that adultery is not an offense 'by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian,' and therefore is not within the exception in  2146 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. Stat. 1913,  4149). It is true that adultery is a voluntary act on the part of both participants, and, strictly speaking, not an offense against the person of either. But are the words of the exception to be taken so strictly? Murder and manslaughter are concededly offenses against the person, and much more serious than is adultery. Was it intended that a prosecution should lie for adultery, but not for murder or manslaughter? Rape also is concededly an offense against the person, and is generally regarded as among the most heinous, so much so that death is often prescribed as the punishment. Was it intended that a prosecution should lie for adultery, where the woman's participation is voluntary, but not for rape, where she is subjected to the same act forcibly and against her will? Is it not obvious that the words of the exception are used in a sense which is more consonant with reason? And are they not intended to be in accord with the policy reflected by the legislation of Congress and its administration for many years, that the relations of the Indians among themselves-the conduct of one toward another-is to be controlled by the customs and laws of \n\n[241 U.S. 602, 606]\n\u00a0\n the tribe, save when Congress expressly or clearly directs otherwise? In our opinion this is the true view. The other would subject them not only to the statute relating to adultery, but also to many others which it seems most reasonable to believe were not intended by Congress to be applied to them. One of these prohibits marriage between persons related within, and not including, the fourth degree of consanguinity, computed according to the rules of the civil law, and affixes a punishment of not more than fifteen years' imprisonment for each violator. To justify a court in holding that these laws are to be applied to Indians, there should be some clear provision to that effect. Certainly that is not so now. Besides, the enumeration in the acts of 1885 and 1903, now  328 and 329 of the Penal Code, of certain offenses as applicable to Indians in the reservations, carries with it some implication of a purpose to exclude others.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Leave granted to present a petition for rehearing herein within sixty days if counsel are so advised, on motion of Solicitor General Davis for the United States.\n June 12, 1916. \n\n\n\n\n","211":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Charles F. Consaul and I. M. Moyers for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The United States brings this appeal from a judgment of the court of claims awarding to Cecil D. Ross the sum of $303.45, as extra pay while he was in charge of the telegraph and telephone office at the general hospital, Presidio of San Francisco. 49 Ct. Cl. 55.\n The facts found by the court were in substance as follows: The claimant enlisted on April 25, 1900, as an infantry private in the United States Army; he was transferred to the Hospital Corps, and on November 8, 1900, to the general hospital at the Presidio, where he was placed in charge of the telegraph and telephone office by verbal order of the surgeon commanding; and he performed duties accordingly, save for intervals of sickness, until he was discharged from the service on April 24, 1903, by reason of the expiration of his term of enlistment. He was not under the supervision of anyone connected with the Signal Corps, but remained under the orders of the medical \n\n[239 U.S. 530, 532]\n\u00a0\n officer in command at the hospital. No pay was given to him on account of his services as telegrapher other than the usual pay and allowances of a private in the Hospital Corps. The muster rolls in the hospital show that during the entire period, except when sick, he was reported as 'telegraph operator.' These muster rolls, 'returns from the Hospital Corps,' passed under the review of the detailing and commanding officers at the hospital, and in due course reached the War Department. An effort was made by the hospital authorities to secure the detail of a man from the Signal Corps in the place of the claimant, but failed. During the time that the claimant was on duty at the hospital, he was excused from other duties, calls, details, and inspection. The fact that he was performing duty in the telegraph and telephone department throughout the entire period, as stated, was personally known to the major and surgeon commanding. The findings also set forth the following exhibit:\n U. S. A. General Hospital,\n Presidio, San Francisco, Cal., November 23, 1903\n\n\n Respectfully returned to Cecil D. Ross, late private, first class, Hospital Corps, U. S.

C., requesting information regarding your detail on extra duty in the telegraph office at this hospital:\n'U. S. A. General Hospital,\n\n'Presidio of S. F., Cal., November 12, 1903.\n\n'Respectfully returned to the Chief, Record and Pension Office, War Department, Washington, D. C., with the information that Private Cecil D. Ross, Hospital Corps, U. S. Army, joined at this hospital for duty Nov. 8, 1900, and was discharged April 24, 1903, by reason of expiration of term of enlistment.\n\n'He was on duty in the telephone and telegraph office \n\n[239 U.S. 530, 533]\n\u00a0\n at this hospital from Nov. 9, 1900, until date of discharge, but no printed order was ever issued detailing him on extra duty, as at an institution of this kind there are many duties to be performed, the general character of which are similar.\n\n'W. P. Kendall,\n\n'Major and Surgeon, U. S.

P. Kendall,\n Major and Surgeon, U. S. Army, Commanding Hospital.\n The government insists that there is no statutory authority for extra- duty pay to enlisted men of the Medical Department of the Army, that the right of recovery is denied by the Army Regulations and by statute, and that the claimant did not perform extra duty.\n From an early date, provision has been made for the payment of enlisted men on extra duty at 'constant labor of not less than ten days.' Acts of March 2, 1819, chap. 45, 3 Stat. at L. 488; May 19, 1846, chap. 22, 9 Stat. at L. 14; July 13, 1866, chap. 176, 14 Stat. at L. 93, Comp. Stat. 1913,  2158; Feb. 1, 1873, chap. 88, 17 Stat. at L. 422, Comp. Stat. 1913 ,  2158; Rev. Stat.  1287, Comp. Stat. 1913,  2158; acts of July 5, 1884, chap. 217, 23 Stat. at L. 110, Comp. Stat. 1913,  6849; March 3, 1885, chap. 339, 23 Stat. at L. 359, Comp. Stat. 1913,  2159. For the present purpose, we may assume that the court of claims correctly construed the provisos of the appropriation acts of July 5, 1884, and March 3, 1885, as amendatory of  1287 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. Stat. 1913,  2158), and as thus having the effect of providing a general rule. 49 Ct. Cl. pp. 63-65. See Army Regulations (1889) 163; (1895) 165; (1901) 183; (1904) 168; (1908) 168; (1910) 169; (1913) 170; 14 Comp. Dec. p. 153; 15 Comp. Dec. p. 375. The applicable clause, in this view, of the act of 1885, provides that 'such extra-duty pay hereafter shall be at the rate of fifty cents per day for mechanics, artisans, school-teachers, and clerks at \n\n[239 U.S. 530, 534]\n\u00a0\n Army, division, and department headquarters, and thirty-five cents per day for other clerks, teamsters, laborers, and other enlisted men on extra duty.'\n The regulation in force at the time in question-to which the government refers as denying the right of recovery-states that 'enlisted men of the several staff departments will not be detailed on extra duty without authority from the Secretary of War. They are not entitled to extra-duty pay for services rendered in their respective departments.' Army Regulations (1895) 167; (1901) 185. And the statute which the government cites (Rev. Stat.  1235, Comp. Stat. 1913,  2007) provides that detail for employment in 'constant labor' shall be 'only upon the written order of a commanding officer, when such detail is for ten or more days.' We agree with the contention of the claimant that the regulation can have force only so far as it may be deemed to be in accord with the acts of Congress; and we may assume in deciding the present case, as was held by the court below, that  1235 of the Revised Statutes was not intended to preclude a recovery of extra-duty pay where there had been a detail to extra duty by competent authority, although not in writing, and extra duty entitling the enlisted man to extra pay under the statute had actually been performed.\n But the question remains whether the claimant did perform 'extra duty.' The term is obviously a relative one; and it cannot be determined that the enlisted man was performing extra duty without a complete understanding of the scope of the duties which he might properly be expected to perform in accordance with his enlistment without receiving extra pay. What might be extra duty in the case of men of the line might not be extra duty in the case of men in the staff departments. The claimant had been transferred to the Hospital Corps; by that transfer he became a member of that Corps and bound to perform, without extra pay, any of the duties which pertained to that \n\n[239 U.S. 530, 535]\n\u00a0\n service. The act of March 1, 1887, chap. 311 (24 Stat. at L. 435, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1819), organizing the Hospital Corps, defining its duty, and fixing the pay of its members (as amended by the act of July 13, 1892, chap. 162, 27 Stat. at L. 120, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1824), provides:\n'That the Hospital Corps of the United States Army shall consist of hospital stewards, acting hospital stewards, and privates; and all necessary hospital services in garrison, camp, or field (including ambulance service) shall be performed by the members thereof, who shall be regularly enlisted in the military service; said Corps shall be permanently attached to the Medical Department, and shall not be included in the effective strength of the Army nor counted as a part of the enlisted force provided by law.\n\n'Sec. 2. That the Secretary of War is empowered to appoint as many hospital stewards as, in his judgment, the service may require; but not more than one hospital steward shall be stationed at any post or place without special authority of the Secretary of War.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 5. That the Secretary of War is empowered to enlist, or cause to be enlisted, as many privates of the Hospital Corps as the service may require, and to limit or fix the number, and make such regulations for their government as may be necessary; and any enlisted man in the Army shall be eligible for transfer to the Hospital Corps as a private. They shall perform duty as ward masters, cooks, nurses, and attendants in hospitals, and as stretcher bearers, litter bearers, and ambulance attendants in the field, and such other duties as may by proper authority be required of them.\n\n'Sec. 6. That the pay of privates of the Hospital Corps shall be eighteen dollars per month, with the increase on account of length of service as is now or may hereafter be allowed by law to other enlisted men. They shall be entitled to the same allowance as a corporal of the arm of service with which they may be on duty.' \n\n[239 U.S. 530, 536]\n\u00a0\n The Army Regulations of 1895 contained the following:\n\n'1433. General hospitals will be under the exclusive control of the Surgeon-General and will be governed by such regulations as the Secretary of War may prescribe. . . .\n\n'1435. The senior surgeon is charged with the management and is responsible for the condition of the post hospital, which will be at all times subject to inspection by the commanding officer. . . .\n\n'1436. The surgeon of the post will assign his assistants and the members of the Hospital Corps to duty, and report them on the muster rolls in the capacity in which they are serving. . . .'\n\n See Army Regulations (1901) 1621, 1628, 1629; (1913) 1439, 1447, 1448.\n It cannot be doubted that it was the intention that the members of the Hospital Corps should perform, for the stated pay, all the duties that are properly incident to the conduct of hospitals as efficient instrumentalities. The act provides that the privates 'shall perform duty as ward masters, cooks, nurses, and attendants in hospitals . . . and such other duties as may by proper authority be required of them.' We know of no way of defining these 'other duties' except by reference to what may be reasonably demanded in the conduct of a fully equipped hospital, considered as an administrative unit, including all that is required in its varied work. Telephone service may well be regarded as essential to the convenient conduct of a properly managed institution of this sort. With a correct understanding of its needs that facility may be deemed to be no less incidental to the hospital service than attendance at the door, or in the reception room, or in connection with the offices of administration. And if, in the practical judgment of the military authorities, the efficient management of a general hospital requires the maintenance of both a telephone \n\n[239 U.S. 530, 537]\n\u00a0\n and telegraph office, we know of no ground for saying that members of the Corps who are assigned to this duty as a part of the current work of the establishment are any more entitled to extra pay than they would be in any other of the numerous activities which the successful administration of the hospital may demand.\n Certainly, the question was one calling in the first instance for the practical judgment of the Department. Numerous regulations, for a very long period of years, have shown the desire to prevent abuses in the service by unwarranted details to 'extra duty' as a basis for extra pay. The regulation, above quoted, that enlisted men of the several staff departments will not be detailed on extra duty without authority from the Secretary of War, is significant in this aspect. In the conduct of an institution like a general hospital, where Congress has provided that all necessary services shall be performed by the members of the Hospital Corps, there is every reason for caution, and for the exercise of careful official judgment, in determining whether a particular case justifies or requires a detail on 'extra duty.' It is said that the authorities in the present instance endeavored to secure the detail of a member of the Signal Corps for the duty in question, but clearly we may not infer from the failure to obtain such assistance from the outside that the service was not regarded as within the scope of the duties which members of the Hospital Corps might properly be required to perform. The inference is to the contrary.\n The judgment of the Department was that the claimant was not on extra duty. He was not in fact assigned on extra duty; there was no such detail in accordance with the regulations or the statute as there should have been if he was considered to be on extra duty. And, in the only official report relative to the matter, it appears that 'no printed order was ever issued detailing him on extra duty, as at an institution of this kind there are many \n\n[239 U.S. 530, 538]\n\u00a0\n duties to be performed, the general character of which are similar.'\n We are asked to overrule this departmental judgment, and to take this service out of the broad description of the statute relating to the duties of members of the Hospital Corps. We find no basis for such action. On the contrary, we cannot escape the conclusion that, in view of the provisions of the act of Congress and of the authorized regulations with respect to the conduct of military hospitals, we are not at liberty to say that extra- duty pay has been earned in connection with service therein-where there was no detail on extra duty-unless there is a clear abuse of the necessary official discretion. No such abuse is shown here.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded, with direction to dismiss the claimant's petition.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","212":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. U S STEEL CORPORATION(1916)\n\nArgued: Decided: March 20, 1916\n\n\n Messrs. Richard V. Lindabury and David A. Reed opposed.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The United States applied to the court below to extend the time for filing the recore from March 15th, 1916, the existing date, to July 1st, to give it time to complete the reduction of the testimony to a narrative form, conformably to equity rule 75. \n\n[240 U.S. 442, 443]\n\u00a0\n The defendant opposed the request on the ground that there was doubt as to the possibility of adequately reducing the testimony, and on the further ground that it desired the testimony brought up in original shape, and because, under all the circumstances of the case, it should not be governed by equity rule 75. The court declined to pass upon the application, but suggested that the parties submit to this court the question whether equity rule 75 was, under the circumstances, imperatively applicable, stating, however, that it had found great advantage in disposing of the case from having the original testimony before it, and was of the opinion that a like advantage would be experienced by this court if the original testimony was brought up. The application before us was then made, and is resisted on the grounds which were urged against it below.\n The facts are these: The testimony was taken before an examiner and embraces 30 volumes, containing 12,151 pages. Of these, 14 volumes, or about 5,969 pages, embrace testimony taken before equity rule 75 became operative. By agreement between the parties, as the testimony was taken it was printed and bound, and the requisite number of copies of the volumes are on hand to serve as part of the record in this court on the appeal. To facilitate the court below, digests and full indexes were prepared by counsel, and all the references to the testimony made by the court below in its opinion are directed to the testimony as contained in the bound volumes.\n Under the facts which we have stated, we are of opinion that the case is an exception to equity rule 75, and should not be controlled by it, and hence that the testimony in its original form as contained in the volumes already printed should constitute a part of the record on appeal, and therefore there is no reason to grant the request for time based upon the contrary assumption. While this is true, however, in order that there may be ample opportunity \n\n[240 U.S. 442, 444]\n\u00a0\n to file the record made up conformably to the views which we have just stated, the time for filing the record, which was extended by this court on March 15th, pending this application, will be now extended sixty days from that date.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","213":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. UNION MFG CO(1916)\nNo. 628\nArgued: February 28, 1916Decided: April 3, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 605, 606]\n\u00a0\n Assistant to the Attorney General Todd for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. W. G. Brantley for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of error under the criminal appeals act of March 2, 1907 (chap. 2564, 34 Stat. at L. 1246, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1704), to review a judgment of the district court for the southern district of Florida, sustaining a demurrer to an indictment for fraudulently misrepresenting the weights of certain shipments of lumber, in violation of the third paragraph of  10 of the act to regulate commerce, as amended June 18, 1910 (chap. 309, 36 Stat. at L. 549, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8574).1 The demurrer \n\n[240 U.S. 605, 607]\n\u00a0\n was sustained upon the ground that the statute, as construed by the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit in Davis v. United States, 43 C. C. A. 448, 104 Fed. 136, requires the prosecution to take place in the district where the goods are billed by the shipper, and the delivery for transportation takes place, which in this instance was not in the southern district of Florida, but in Georgia.\n The indictment contains ten counts, charging as many different offenses. They are alike in form, and a summary of the first will suffice. It recites that the South Georgia Railway Company was a common carrier by rail, engaged in the interstate transportation of yellow pine lumber for hire from Baden, in the state of Georgia, to Greenville, in the southern district of Florida, and had filed and published schedules and tariffs showing the rate and charge for transportation of such lumber under 6 inches in thickness in carload lots between those points to be $7 for each carload lot of the weight of 24,000 pounds, excess in proportion; that the schedules and tariffs further provided that when the actual weight of a shipment was not ascertained at point of shipment or at destination or in transit, the freight charges should be based upon an estimated weight of 5, 000 pounds for each 1,000 feet; that the Union Manufacturing Company was and is a corporation engaged in shipping said property from Baden to Greenville, and J. T. Prince was its agent, \n\n[240 U.S. 605, 608]\n\u00a0\n having general charge and control of the shipments and the payment of freight charges therefor; that on a date specified, and while said schedules and tariffs were in effect, said railway company transported from Baden to Greenville for the manufacturing company a specified carload of yellow pine lumber under 6 inches in thickness, and delivered it at Greenville to the manufacturing company; that the actual weight of said carload lot was not ascertained at Baden, or at Greenville, or in transit; that the manufacturing company thereafter unloaded the lumber from the car and ascertained the number of feet thereof; and that the said company, and Prince, acting as its agent, well knowing the number of feet to be 9,074, then and there falsely and fraudulently represented to the railway company that the number of feet was 7,200, in consequence of which the railway company charged and the Union Lumber Company paid for the transportation of said lumber less than the lawful charge provided in the schedules and tariffs, and at a less rate than the lawfully established rate.\n In our opinion, the court below misapplied the decision in Davis v. United States, supra. In that case, which arose under the act as it stood before the amendment of 1910 (25 Stat. at L. 855, chap. 382, 1 Rev. Stat. Supp. 687, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8569), the circumstances were very different from those now presented. The acts charged were misrepresentations by false billing and classification of certain property delivered by defendants to the railway company at Cincinnati, Ohio, for transportation thence to Dallas, Texas. The contract of carriage was made at Cincinnati, where defendants resided and carried on business, and the bill of exceptions showed that everything connected with the shipment of the goods except the carriage and delivery took place in Cincinnati. The court said (p. 139): 'We think that false billing or other misrepresentation of the goods, as stated in the act, which \n\n[240 U.S. 605, 609]\n\u00a0\n results in their being received by the carrier under a contract of carriage thus fraudulently obtained, is the obtaining of transportation within the meaning of the statute. Then the fraudulent conduct of the shipper has borne its fruit, and every act and intent which constitutes the offense is complete.' It was accordingly held that the offense was indictable in the southern district of Ohio, and not in the northern district of Texas, within which was the destination of the goods. We are not called upon to either concede or question the propriety of this decision upon the facts that were there presented. General expressions contained in the opinion are, of course, to be interpreted in the light of those facts. Another case of the same kind is Re Belknap, 96 Fed. 614. These cases are not in point with the present. In each of them the fraud was that of the consignor. Here it is the consignee and its agent against whom fraud is charged. (The fact that the consignee was also the consignor is of no significance, since the fraud alleged was in what it did as consignee.) There the fraud inhered in the making of the contract of carriage; here it had to do with the liquidation of the amount payable for freight at destination.\n The act, by its very terms, applies to consignees as well as to consignors. But as it applies only to interstate transportation, the consignee is normally a resident of a different state, and therefore of a different district, from that where the goods are billed by the shipper and the delivery for transportation takes place. To say, therefore, that the act contemplates an indictment only in the district where the goods are billed by the shipper is in effect to say that in most cases the consignee either may not be indicted at all, or else must be indicted in a district of which he is not a resident, and which in many instances he may never have visited. We hold that the offenses charged in this indictment were 'wholly or in \n\n[240 U.S. 605, 610]\n\u00a0\n part committed' in the southern district of Florida. See United States v. Freeman, \n239 U.S. 117\n, 60 L. ed. --, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 32.\n It is insisted in behalf of defendants in error that since the indictment shows that the transportation had been completed and the lumber delivered to the consignee before the alleged fraudulent representations were made, it cannot be said that the fraud charged amounted to either obtaining or attempting to obtain transportation for the property at less than the established rates. If the statute on which the indictment is based were analogous to the familiar acts rendering criminal the obtaining of money or other property by false pretenses, the argument would be cogent. Under such statutes, it is commonly if not universally held to be essential to criminality that the false pretense shall precede the obtaining of the property. People v. Haynes, 14 Wend. 546, 563, 564, 28 Am. Dec. 530, reversing 11 Wend. 557; State v. Church, 43 Conn. 471, 479; State v. Moore, 111 N. C. 667, 674, 16 S. E. 384; State v. Willard, 109 Mo. 242, 247, 19 S. W. 189; Watson v. People, 27 Ill. App. 493, 496.\n The statutory provision with which we are dealing has a very different purpose. It is not designed especially to protect the property rights of the carrier, for the offense is made equally punishable whether committed with or without the consent or connivance of the carrier. It originated in the 1889 amendment to the act to regulate commerce (chap. 382, 25 Stat. at L. 855, 858, 1 Rev. Stat. Supp. 684, 687, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8569, 8576), and is but one of many provisions enacted by Congress with the object of preventing discriminations and favoritism as between shippers by requiring the publication of tariffs and prohibiting any departure from them. The prohibitions of the original act of February 4, 1887 (chap. 104,  2, 3, 6, 10, 24 Stat. at L. 376, 1 Rev. Stat. Supp. 529, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8564, 8565, 8569, 8574), were addressed to the carrier alone. The 1889 amendment brought shipper and consignee within the scope of the law, both by enacting that false billing, etc., should be punishable criminally, \n\n[240 U.S. 605, 611]\n\u00a0\n and by providing similar punishment for inducing discriminations by the payment of money or other thing of value, solicitation, or otherwise. The 1910 amendment (chap. 309,  10, 36 Stat. at L. 539, 549, Comp. Stat. 1913 ,  8574) extended the range of the prohibition to certain other fraudulent practices by consignors and consignees, committed for like purposes.\n In denouncing as criminal 'false billing, false classification, false weighing, false representation of the contents of the package or the substance of the property, false report of weight, false statement, or other device or means' employed in order to 'obtain or attempt to obtain transportation for such property at less than the regular rates then established,' the lawmaker regarded not merely the physical transportation of the property, but the entire transaction through which consignor or consignee might seek to evade the policy of the act to subject all interstate shipments to uniform rates of charge prescribed in published tariffs. In a case where for any reason the payment of the freight is not made prior to the delivery of the goods to the consignee, but remains to be afterwards adjusted, the effort to obtain an advantage not permitted by the schedules may still be exerted through fraudulent representations influencing the adjustment of the freight, with precisely the same effect as if the representations had preceded delivery of the goods. When this is accomplished, there is a fraudulent obtaining of transportation at less than the established rate, within the meaning of the prohibition. Thus it needs only that we interpret the statute according to the plain meaning of the terms employed, in the light of subjectmatter and context, in order to conclude, as we do, that the acts set forth in this indictment are punishable criminally under the act.\n The judgment of the District Court will be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Any person, corporation, or company, or any agent or officer thereof, who shall deliver property for transportation to any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act, or for whom, as consignor or consignee, any such carrier shall transport property, who shall knowingly and wilfully, directly or indirectly, himself or by employee, agent, officer, or otherwise, by false billing, false classification, false weighing, false representation of the contents of the package or the substance of the property, false report of weight, false statement, or by any other device or means, whether with or without the consent or connivance of the carrier, its agent, or officer, obtain or attempt to obtain transportation for such property at less than the regular rates then established and in force on the line of transportation; . . . shall be deemed guilty of fraud, which is hereby declared to be a misdemeanor, and shall, upon conviction thereof in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction within the district in which such offense was wholly or in part committed, be subject for each offense to a fine,' etc. \n\n\n\n\n","214":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S, EX PARTE(1916)\nNo. 11\nArgued: Decided: December 4, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 27, 28]\n\u00a0\n Mr.John M.

Chute as amici curiae.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court.\n The accused pleading guilty to an indictment charging him in several counts with embezzling the money of a national bank embexxling the money of a national bank of which he was an officer, and making false entries in its books, in violation of  5209, Revised Statutes (Comp. Stat. 1913,  9772), was sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary for five years, the shortest term which, under the statute, could have been imposed upon him. At once at his request, over the objection of the United States district attorney, the court ordered 'that the execution of the sentence be, and it is hereby, suspended during the good behavior of the defendant, and for the purpose of this case this term of this court is kept open for five years.' The United States moved to set this order aside on the ground that, as it was not a mere temporary suspension of the sentence to enable legal proceedings pending or contemplated to revise it to be taken, or application for pardon to be made, or any other legal relief against the sentence to be resorted to, but, on the contrary, as it was a permanent suspension based upon considerations extraneous to the legality of the conviction or the duty to enforce the sentence, the order of suspension was void, as it was equivalent to a refusal to carry out the statute. The motion was denied. In the opinion giving its reasons for so doing, the court, conceding that the suspension was permanent, stated the \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 38]\n\u00a0\n general considerations which it deemed it was required to take into view in decideing whether the sentence should be enforced, conceding the legality of the conviction and sentence and their finality, as follows:\n'Modern notions respecting the treatment of law breakers abandon the theory that the imposition of the sentence is solely to punish, and now the best thought considers three elements properly to enter into the treatment of every criminal case after conviction. Punishment in some measure is still the object of sentence, but, affecting its extent and character, we consider the effect of the situation upon the individual, as tending to reform him from or to confirm him in a criminal career, and also the relation his case bears to the community in the effect of the disposition of it upon others of criminal tendencies.'\n\n After pointing out the peculiar aptitude possessed by a trial judge for the appreciation of such conditions, and the imperative duty which rested upon such judge to consider and weigh the matters stated, and to determine, as an inherent attribute of judicial power, whether a permanent suspension of the term of imprisonment fixed by the statute should be ordered, the circumstances upon which it was concluded that a permanent suspension should be directed were stated in part as follows:\n'We took into account the peculiar circumstances under which his crime was committed, having regard to the temptations which from time to time encompassed him, and his personal necessities, and the purposes for which his appropriations were made. Also, the fact that his friends made his employers whole, and that otherwise he had so commended himself to the favor of his employers suffering by his crime, that they at all times, as well as now, evince a disposition to forgive his abuse of their confidence, and to support him against the punishment which the law provides. We find that otherwise than for this crime, his disposition, character, and habits have so strongly com- \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 39]\n\u00a0\n mended him to his friends, acquaintances, and persons of his faith, that they are unanimous in the belief that the exposure and humiliation of his conviction are a sufficient punishment, and that he can be saved to the good of society if nothing further is done with him.'\n\n After further elaborating considerations of a like nature, and stating very many circumstances confirming those mentioned, to leave no room for doubt that its action was intended to be permanent and was based alone on the extraneous circumstances stated, the court said:\n'Passing now to the concrete case, we observe for the benefit of the United States that nothing exists in this case which moved the court to suspend the execution of sentence to prevent 'an abuse of the court's process, or to prevent an injustice being done to the defendant,' so far as it may be said that abstract justice required defendant to suffer for his crime. However, we considered the defendant from many standpoints to be as worthy of the benefit of the discretion to suspend the execution of his sentence as any other convict upon whom that favor has hitherto been bestowed.'\n\n Following a written demand which was thereafter made upon the clerk to issue a commitment, which was refused by him on the ground that the sentence had been suspended, and the further refusal of the judge to direct the clerk to issue such commitment, the United States sought and obtained a rule to show cause why a mandamus should not be awarded directing the judge to vacate the order of suspension, under which the subject is now before us for consideration.\n The remedial appropriateness of the writ of mandamus is at the threshold questioned, but we dispose of the subject by a mere reference to adjudged cases conclusively establishing the want of foundation for the contention.

In addition, however, it is urged that, as the right to resort to the extraordinary remedy by mandamus must rest upon the assumption that the order of suspension was absolutely void, therefore the rule for the writ should have been directed not against the judge, but against the clerk, to compel him to issue the commitment. But we pass from its consideration, as we are of opinion that its want of merit will be completely demonstrated by the slightest appreciation of the judicial duties of the court below and the ministerial relation of the clerk of the court to the same.\n The return to the rule and the statement in support of the same lucidly portray the contentions involved in the question of power to be decided, and the subject in all its aspects has been elaborately discussed, not only by the printed arguments of the parties, but, in addition, light has been thrown on the general question by an argument submitted by the New York State Probation Commission, explaining the statutory system of parol prevailing in that state, and by an able argument presented by members of the bar of the first circuit in behalf of a practice of mitigating or pretermitting, when deemed necessary, the statutory punishment for crimes, which it is declared has prevailed in the United States courts in that circuit for many years.\n The argument on behalf of the respondent concedes that the order of suspension was permanent, and absolutely removed the accused from the operation of the punishment provided by the statute; and it is further conceded that a suspension of this character was the equivalent of an absolute and permanent refusal to impose, under the statute, any sentence whatever. However absolute may be the right thus asserted, it is nevertheless said it is not without limitation, since it may not be capriciously called \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 41]\n\u00a0\n into play. Passing the question whether this assumed restriction is not in the nature of things imaginary as the result of the scope of the authority asserted, let us come to dispose of the contention made by examining the propositions relied upon to sustain it.\n They are: 1. That the right to refuse to impose a sentence fixed by statute, or to refuse to execute such a sentence when imposed, is a discretion inhering in the judicial power to try and punish violations of the criminal law. 2. That even if there be doubt on this subject as an original proposition, such doubt is dispelled as the right was recognized and frequently exerted at common law. 3. That the power claimed has also been recognized by decisions of state courts and of United States courts of original jurisdiction to such an extent that the doctrine is now to be considered as not open to controversy. 4. That whatever may be the possibility of dispute as to this last view, at least it cannot be denied that in both the state and Federal courts, over a very long period of time, the power here asserted has been exercised, often with the express, and constantly with the tacit, approval of the administrative officers of the state and Federal governments, and has been also tacitly recognized by the inaction of the legislative department during the long time the practice has prevailed, to such an extent that the authority claimed has in practice become a part of the administration of criminal law, both state and Federal, not subject to be now questioned or overthrown because of mere doubts of the theoretical accuracy of the conceptions upon which it is founded.\n\n 1. \nThe contention as to inherent judicial power.\n Indisputably under our constitutional system the right to try offenses against the criminal laws, and, upon conviction, to impose the punishment provided by law, is judicial, and it is equally to be conceded that, in exerting the powers vested in them on such subject, courts inherently possess \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 42]\n\u00a0\n ample right to exercise reasonable, that is, judicial, discretion to enable them to wisely exert their authority. But these concessions afford no ground for the contention as to power here made, since it must rest upon the proposition that the power to enforce begets inherently a discretion to permanently refuse to do so. And the effect of the proposition urged upon the distribution of powers made by the Constitution will become apparent when it is observed that indisputable also is it that the authority to define and fix the punishment for crime is legislative, and includes the right in advance to bring within judicial discretion for the purpose of executing the statute elements of consideration which would be otherwise beyond the scope of judicial authority, and that the right to relieve from the punishment fixed by law and ascertained according to the methods by it provided, belongs to the executive department.\n The proposition might well be left with the demonstration which results from these considerations, but the disregard of the Constitution which would result from sustaining the proposition is made, if possible, plainer by considering that, if it be that the plain legislative command fixing a specific punishment for crime is subject to be permanently set aside by an implied judicial power upon considerations extraneous to the legality of the conviction, it would seem necessarily to follow that there could be likewise implied a discretionary authority to permanently refuse to try a criminal charge because of the conclusion that a particular act made criminal by law ought not to be treated as criminal. And thus it would come to pass that the possession by the judicial department of power to permanently refuse to enforce a law would result in the destruction of the conceded powers of the other departments, and hence leave no law to be enforced.\n\n 2. \nThe contention as to support for the proposition at common law. \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 43]\n\u00a0\n The common law is thus stated in Hale's Pleas of the Crown, vol. 2, chap. 58, p. 412:\n'Reprieves or stays of judgment or execution are of three kinds, viz.:\n\n'I. Ex mandato regis. . . .\n\n'II. Ex arbitrio judicis. Sometimes the judge reprieves before judgment, as where he is not satisfied with the verdict, or the evidence is uncertain, or the indictment insufficient, or doubtful whether within clergy; and sometimes after judgment, if it be a small felony, tho out of clergy, or in order to a pardon or transportation. Crompt. Just. 22b, and these arbitrary reprieves may be granted or taken off by the justices of gaol-delivery, altho their sessions be adjourned or finished, and this by reason of common usage. 2 Dyer, 205a, 73 Eng. Reprint, 452.\n\n'III. Ex necessitate legis, which is in case of pregnancy, where a woman is convict of felony or treason.'\n\n Blackstone thus expresses it:\n'The only other remaining ways of avoiding the execution of the judgment are by a reprieve or a pardon; whereof the former is temporary only, the latter permanent.\n\n'I. A reprieve (from reprendre, to take back), is the withdrawing of a sentence for an interval of time; whereby the execution is suspended. This may be, first ex arbitrio judicis; either before or after judgment; as, where the judge is not satisfied with the verdict, or the evidence is suspicious, or the indictment is insufficient, or he is doubtful whether the offense be within clergy; or sometimes if it be a small felony, or any favourable circumstances appear in the criminal's character, in order to give room to apply to the Crown for either an absolute or conditional pardon. These arbitrary reprieves may be granted or taken off by the justices of gaol delivery, although their session be finished, and their commission expired; but this rather by common usage, than of strict right. \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 44]\n\u00a0\n 'Reprieves may also be ex necessitate legis: as, where a woman is capitally convicted, and pleads her pregnancy; though this is no cause to stay the judgment, yet it is to respite the execution till she be delivered. This is a mercy dictated by the law of nature, in favorem prolis.' Bk. 4, chap. 31, pp. 394, 395.\n\n While it may not be doubted under the common law as thus stated that courts possessed and asserted the right to exert judicial discretion in the enforcement of the law to temporarily suspend either the imposition of sentence or its execution when imposed to the end that pardon might be procured, or that a violation of law in other respects might be prevented, we are unable to perceive any ground for sustaining the proposition that, at common law, the courts possessed or claimed the right which is here insisted upon. No elaboration could make this plainer than does the text of the passages quoted. It is true that, owing to the want of power in common-law courts to grant new trials, and to the absence of a right to review convictions in a higher court, it is, we think, to be conceded: (a) That both suspensions of sentence and suspensions of the enforcement of sentences temporary in character were often resorted to on grounds of error or miscarriage of justice which, under our system, would be corrected either by new trials or by the exercise of the power to review. ( b) That not infrequently where the suspension either of the imposition of a sentence or of its execution was made for the purpose of enabling a pardon to be sought or bestowed, by a failure to further proceed in the criminal cause in the future, although no pardon had been sought or obtained, the punishment fixed by law was es aped. But neither of these conditions serve to convert the mere exercise of a judicial discretion to temporarily suspend for the accomplishment of a purpose contemplated by law into the existence of an arbitrary judicial power to permanently refuse to enforce the law. \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 45]\n\u00a0\n And we can deduce no support for the contrary contention from the rulings in 2 Dyer, 165a, 205a, and 235a, 73 Eng. Reprint, 359, 452, 519, since those cases but illustrate the exercise of the conceded, reasonable, discretionary power to reprieve to enable a lawful end to be attained. Nor from the fact that common-law courts possessed the power by recognizance to secure good behavior, that is, to enforce the law, do we think any support is afforded for the proposition that those courts possessed the arbitrary discretion to permanently decline to enforce the law. The cases of Hart's Trial, 30 How. St. Tr. 1344 and Reg. v. Dunn, 12 Q. B. 1026, 1041, 116 Eng. Reprint, 1155, 18 L. J. Mag. Cas. N. S. 41, certainly do not tend to so establish, since they simply manifest the exertion of the power of the courts after a conviction and the suffering of the legal penalty to exact from the convicted person a bond for his good behavior thereafter.\n\n 3. \nThe support for the power asserted claimed to be derived from the adjudication of state and Federal courts.\n Coming first to the state courts, undoubtedly there is conflict in the decisions. The area, however, of conflict will be narrowed by briefly stating and contrasting the cases. We shall do so by referring chronologically to the cases denying the power, and then to those relied upon to establish it.\n In 1838 the supreme court of North Carolina in State v. Bennett, 20 N. C. 170 (4 Dev. & B. L. 43), was called upon to decide whether a trial court had the right to permanently remit upon condition a part of a criminal sentence fixed by statute. The court said:\n'We know that a practice has prevailed to some extent of inflicting fines with a provision that they should be diminished or remitted altogether upon matter thereafter to be done, or shown to the court by the person convicted. But we can find no authority in law for this practice, and feel ourselves bound, upon this first occasion when it is brought judicially to our notice, to declare it illegal.' \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 46]\n\u00a0\n In 1860, in People v. Morrisette, 20 How. Pr. 118, an accused, after pleading guilty, asked a suspension of sentence and to be then discharged from custody. The court said:\n\n'I am of the opinion the court does not possess the power to suspend sentence indefinitely in any case. As I understand the law, it is the duty of the court, unless application be made for a new trial, or a motion in arrest of judgment be made for some defect in the indictment, to pronounce judgment upon every prisoner convicted of crime by a jury, who pleads guilty. An indefinite suspension of the sentence prescribed by law is a quasi pardon, provided the prisoner be discharged from imprisonment. No court in the state has any pardoning power. That power is vested exclusively in the governor.'\n\n In People v. Brown, 54 Mich. 15, 19 N. W. 571, in deciding that no power to permanently suspend a sentence existed, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Cooley the court said:\n'Now it is no doubt competent for a criminal court, after conviction, to stay for a time its sentence; and many good reasons may be suggested for doing so; such as to give opportunity for a motion for a new trial or in arrest, or to enable the judge to better satisfy his own mind what the punishment ought to be (Com. v. Dowdican, 115 Mass. 133); but it was not a suspension of judgment of this sort that was requested or desired in this case; it was not a mere postponement; it was not delay for any purpose of better advising the judicial mind what ought to be done; but it was an entire and absolute remission of all penalty and the excusing of all guilt. In other words, what was requested of the judge was that he should take advantage of the fact that he alone was empowered to pass sentence, and, by postponing indefinitely the performance of this duty, indirectly, but to completed effect, grant to the respondent a pardon for his crime.'\n\n And considering the doctrine as to the want of power \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 47]\n\u00a0\n thus expounded from the point of view of the common law and of every argument here relied upon, state courts have, in the cases which are in the margin, in careful opinions denied the existence of the power now claimed. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The cases to the contrary are these, omitting one in a court of original jurisdiction in Massachusetts, referred to by counsel, but in which there is no written opinion:\n In 1874 in Com. v. Dowdican, supra, the right in a criminal case 'to lay the case on file' and postpone the sentence was sustained, the court declaring that the practice had long existed, and was recognized by statutes, one of which regulated the granting of parol by courts in liquor cases. \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 48]\n\u00a0\n The case just cited was approvingly referred to in Sylvester v. State, 65 N. H. 193, 20 Atl. 954, and declared to express the practice long prevailing in New Hampshire.\n In 1894, in People ex rel. Forsyth v. Court of Sessions, 141 N. Y. 288, 23 L.R.A. 856, 36 N. E. 386, 15 Am. Crim. Rep. 675, in holding that a trial court had power to permanently suspend a sentence for reasons dehors the legality of the conviction, it was declared that such power existed at common law and hence prevailed in the state, this being supported by a quotation from Hale's Pleas of the Crown. In addition it was said, referring to a state parol statute enacted subsequent to the conviction, that such statute, while it conferred no new or other power than that possessed at common law, nevertheless imposed the duty to see to it that the power was not lost to impose future punishment after the release if the condition of suspension was violated.\n In the cases cited in the margin the power was upheld upon the rulings in Com. v. Dowdican, and the Forsyth Case, supra, or because of a practice long prevailing. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Leaving aside the question of the asserted duty to sustain the doctrine because of the long-established prac- \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 49]\n\u00a0\n tice, which we shall hereafter consider, we think it clear that the long and settled line of authority to which we have previously referred, denying the existence of the power, is in no way weakened by the rulings which lie at the basis of the cases relied upon to the contrary. In the first place, on the face of the opinion in Com. v. Dowdican, supra, it would seem certain that that case treated the power as being brought by the state legislation which was referred to within the domain of reasonable discretion, since by the effect of that legislation the right to exert such power, if not directly authorized, was at least, by essential implication, sanctioned by the state law. In the second place, in so far as the Forsyth Case, supra, is concerned and its declaration as to what was the common law upon the subject, the error thus fallen into is not only demonstrated by what we have said as to the common law, but is additionally shown by the fact that the quotation from Hale's Pleas of the Crown, made in the opinion, contains clauses supporting the opinion expressed as to the common law when in fact the clauses in question, it would seem, were, by some error of citation, mistakenly attributed to Hale. We say this because the clauses referred to and attributed to Hale in the quotation are not found in any edition of the Pleas of the Crown which we have been able to examine, and it is stated by counsel for the United States that, after diligent search, no passage containing the clauses has been discovered, and the existence of any edition of the work containing them is not pointed out by opposing counsel. But whether this be well founded or not, as the conclusion concerning the common law which the case expressed is, we think, obviously unsound, we are unable, on the authority of such a mistaken view, to disregard the long established and sound rule laid down in the many state cases which we have quoted.\n So far as the courts of the United States are concerned \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 50]\n\u00a0\n it suffices to say that we have been referred to no opinion maintaining the asserted power, and, on the contrary, in the opinion in the only case in which the subject was considered, it was expressly decided the power was wanting. United States v. Wilson, 46 Fed. 748 (1891). It is true that in the District of Columbia the existence of the power was maintained. Miller v. United States, 41 App. D. C. 52 (1913). But the unsoundness of the grounds upon which the conclusion was based is demonstrated by what we have previously said; and, aside from this, as the subject was covered by an act of Congress conferring power of parol (Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. at L. 864, chap. 433), the case requires no further consideration.\n\n 4. \nThe duty to recognize the power as lawful because of its exertion in practice by the state and Federal courts, and the implications arising therefrom.\n There is no doubt that in some states, without reference to probation legislation or an affirmative recognition of any doctrine supporting the power, it was originally exerted, and the right to continue to do so came to be recognized solely as the result of the prior practice. State ex rel. Gehrmann v. Osborne, 79 N. J. Eq. 430, 82 Atl. 424.\n As to the courts of the United States, in one of the circuits, the first, especially in the Massachusetts district, it is admitted the practice has in substance existed for probably sixty years, as the result of a system styled 'laying the case on file.' The origin of this system is not explained, but it is stated in the brief supporting the practice that courts of the United States have considered the existing state laws as to probation, and have endeavored in a certain manner to conform their action thereto. It is true, also, that in the courts of the United States, sometimes in one or more districts in a circuit and sometimes in other circuits, in many instances the power here asserted was exerted, it would seem without any question, there being no objection raised by the representatives of \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 51]\n\u00a0\n the United States; indeed, it is said that in Ohio, where the power, as we have seen, was recognized as existing, it was exerted by Mr. Justice Matthews of this court when sitting at circuit, and there and elsewhere, it is pointed out, the power was also exerted in some instances by other judges then or subsequently members of this court. But yet it is also true that, numerous as are the instances of the exertion of the power, the practice was by no means universal, many United States judges, even in a district where the power had been exerted, on a change of incumbency, persistently refusing to exert the power on the ground that it was not possessed. Indeed, so far was this the case that we think it may be said that the exertion of the power under the circumstances stated was intermittent, and was not universal, but partial.\n As amply shown by the case before us, we think also it is apparent that the situation thus described was brought about by the scrupulous desire of judges not to abuse their undoubted discretion as to granting new trials, and yet to provide a remedy for conditions in cases where a remedy was called for in the interest of the administration of the criminal law itself, as well as by the most obvious considerations of humanity and public well-being,-conditions arising in the nature of things from the state of proof in cases coming before them which could not possibly have been foreseen and taken into consideration by the lawmaking mind in fixing in advance the penalty to be imposed for a particular crime. And the force of this conclusion will become more manifest by considering that nowhere except sporadically was any objection made to the practice by the prosecuting officers of the United States, who, indeed, it is said, not infrequently invoked its exercise. Albeit this is the case, we can see no reason for saying that we may now hold that the right exists to continue a practice which is inconsistent with the Constitution, since its exercise, in the very nature of things, \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 52]\n\u00a0\n amounts to a refusal by the judicial power to perform a duty resting upon it, and, as a consequence thereof, to an interference with both the legislative and executive authority as fixed by the Constitution. The fact that it is said in argument that many persons, exceeding two thousand, are now at large who otherwise would be imprisoned as the result of the exertion of the power in the past, and that misery and anguish and miscarriage of justice may come to many innocent persons by now declaring the practice illegal, presents a grave situation. But we are admonished that no authority exists to cure wrongs resulting from a violation of the Constitution in the past, however meritorious may have been the motive giving rise to it, by sanctioning a disregard of that instrument in the future. On the contrary, so far as wrong resulting from an attempt to do away with the consequences of the mistaken exercise of the power in the past is concerned, complete remedy may be afforded by the exertion of the pardoning power; and, so far as the future is concerned, that is, the causing of the imposition of penalties as fixed to be subject, by probation legislation or such other means as the legislative mind may devise, to such judicial discretion as may be adequate to enable courts to meet, by the exercise of an enlarged but wise discretion, the infinite variations which may be presented to them for judgment, recourse must be had to Congress, whose legislative power on the subject is, in the very nature of things, adequately complete.\n While the conclusions just stated inevitably exact that the rule which is before us be made absolute and that the mandamus issue, nevertheless we are of opinion that the exceptional conditions which we have described require that we exercise that reasonable discretion with which we are vested to temporarily suspend the issue of the writ so as to afford ample time for executive clemency or such other action as may be required to meet the sit- \n\n[242 U.S. 27, 53]\n\u00a0\n uation. And for this purpose the issue of the writ will be stayed until the end of this term, unless the United States otherwise requests, when it will go as a matter of course.\n Rule made absolute. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] People v.

JIN FUEY MOY(1916)\nNo. 525\nArgued: December 7, 1915Decided: June 5, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 394, 395]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Wallace and Mr. W. C. Herron for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 394, 397]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. Ralph Burton, Levi Cooke, George X. McLanahan, and William Strite McDowell for defendant in error.\n\n\n[241 U.S. 394, 399]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an indictment under  8 of the act of December 17, 1914, chap. 1, 38 Stat. at L. 785, 789. It was quashed by the district court on the ground that the statute did not apply to the case. 225 Fed. 1003. The indictment charges a conspiracy with Willie Martin to have in Martin's possession opium and salts thereof, to wit, one dram of morphine sulphate. It alleges that Martin was not registered with the collector of internal revenue of the district, and had not paid the special tax required; that the defendant, for the purpose of executing the conspiracy, issued to Martin a written prescription for the morphine sulphate, and that he did not issue it in good faith, but knew that the drug was not given for medicinal purposes, but for the purpose of supplying one addicted to the use of opium. The question is whether the possession conspired for is within the prohibitions of the act.\n The act is entitled, 'An Act to Provide for the Registration of, with Collectors of Internal Revenue, and to Impose a Special Tax Upon, All Persons Who Produce, Import, Manufacture, Compound, Deal in, Dispense, Sell, Distribute, or Give Away Opium or Coca Leaves, Their Salts, Derivatives, or Preparations, and for Other Purposes.' By  1 the persons mentioned in the title are required to register, and to pay \n\n[241 U.S. 394, 400]\n\u00a0\n a special tax at the rate of $1 per annum, with certain exceptions, and it is made unlawful for the persons required to register to produce, etc., the drugs without having registered and paid the special tax. All provisions of law relating to special taxes are extended to this tax. By  2 it is declared unlawful for any person to sell or give away the drugs mentioned without a written order, provided for, excepting deliveries by physicians, etc., or on their order, and certain other cases. Then, after provision for returns, it is made unlawful by  4 for any person who shall not have registered and paid the special tax to send, carry, or deliver the drugs in such commerce as Congress controls, again with exceptions. By  6 preparations containing certain small proportions of the drugs are excluded from the operation of the act, under conditions. By  7 internal revenue tax laws are made applicable, and then comes  8, under which the indictment is framed.\n By  8 it is declared unlawful for 'any person' who is not registered and has not paid the special tax to have in his possession or control any of the said drugs, and 'such possession or control' is made presumptive evidence of a violation of this section and of  1. There is a proviso that the section shall not apply to any employee of a registered person and certain others, with qualifications, or to the possession of any of the drugs which have been prescribed in good faith by a physician registered under the act, and to the possession of some others. And finally it is provided that the exemptions need not be negatived in any indictment, etc., and that the burden of proving them shall be upon the defendant. The district judge considered that the act was a revenue act, and that the general words, 'any person,' must be confined to the class of persons with whom the act previously had been purporting to deal. The government, on the other hand, contends that this act was passed with two others in order \n\n[241 U.S. 394, 401]\n\u00a0\n to carry out the international opium convention (38 Stat. at L. 1929); that Congress gave it the appearance of a taxing measure in order to give it a coating of constitutionality, but that it really was a police measure that strained all the powers of the legislature, and that  8 means all that it says, taking its words in their plain, literal sense.\n A statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that score. United States ex rel. Atty. Gen. v. Delaware & H. Co. \n213 \nU.S. 366, 408\n, 53 S. L. ed. 836, 849, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 527. If we could know judicially that no opium is produced in the United States, the difficulties in this case would be less; but we hardly are warranted in that assumption when the act itself purports to deal with those who produce it.  1. Congress, at all events, contemplated production in the United States, and therefore the act must be construed on the hypothesis that it takes place. If opium is produced in any of the states, obviously the gravest question of power would be raised by an attempt of Congress to make possession of such opium a crime. United States v. De Witt, 9 Wall. 41, 19 L. ed. 593. The government invokes article 6 of the Constitution, that treaties made under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land. But the question arises under a statute, not under a treaty. The statute does not purport to be in execution of a treaty, but calls itself a registration and taxing act. The provision before us was not required by the opium convention, and whether this section is entitled to the supremacy claimed by the government for treaties is, to say the least, another grave question; and, if it is reasonably possible, the act should be read so as to avoid both.\n The foregoing consideration gains some additional force from the penalty imposed by  9 upon any person who violates any of the requirements of the act. It is a fine of not more than $2,000, or imprisonment for not more than \n\n[241 U.S. 394, 402]\n\u00a0\n five years, or both, in the discretion of the court. Only words from which there is no escape could warrant the conclusion that Congress meant to strain its powers almost if not quite to the breaking point in order to make the probably very large proportion of citizens who have some preparation of opium in their possession criminal or at least prima facie criminal, and subject to the serious punishment made possible by  9. It may be assumed that the statute has a moral end as well as revenue in view, but we are of opinion that the district court, in treating those ends as to be reached only through a revenue measure, and within the limits of a revenue measure, was right.\n Approaching the issue from this point of view we conclude that 'any person not registered' in  8 cannot be taken to mean any person in the United States, but must be taken to refer to the class with which the statute undertakes to deal,-the persons who are required to register by  1. It is true that the exemption of possession of drugs prescribed in good faith by a physician is a powerful argument, taken by itself, for a broader meaning. But every question of construction is unique, and an argument that would prevail in one case may be inadequate in another. This exemption emption stands alongside of one that saves employees of registered persons, as do  1 and 4, and nurses under the supervision of a physician, etc., as does  4, and is so far vague that it may have had in mind other persons carrying out a doctor's orders rather than the patients. The general purpose seems to be to apply to possession exemptions similar to those applied to registration. Even if for a moment the scope and intent of the act were lost sight of, the proviso is not enough to overcome the dominant considerations that prevail in our mind.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Hughes and Mr. Justice Pitney dissent. \n\n\n\n","216":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. FORTY BARRELS AND TWENTY KEGS OF COCA COLA(1916)\nNo. 562\nArgued: February 29, 1916Decided: May 22, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 265, 266]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Underwood and Mr. Elliott Cheatham for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Harold Hirsch, J. B. Sizer, A. W. Chambliss, and W. D. Thomson for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[241 U.S. 265, 270]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a libel for condemnation under the food and drugs act (June 30, 1906, chap. 3915, 34 Stat. at L. 768, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8717), of a certain quantity of a food product known as 'Coca Cola' transported for sale, from Atlanta, Georgia, to Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was alleged that the product was adulterated and misbranded. The allegation of adulteration was, in substance, that the product contained an added poisonous or added deleterious ingredient, caffeine \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 271]\n\u00a0\n which might render the product injurious to health. It was alleged to be misbranded in that the name 'Coca Cola' was a representation of the presence of the substances coca and cola; that the product 'contained no coca and little if any cola' and thus was an 'imitation' of these substances and was offered for sale under their 'distinctive name.' We omit other charges which the government subsequently withdrew. The claimant answered, admitting that the product contained as one of its ingredients 'a small portion of caffeine,' but denying that it was either an 'added' ingredient, or a poisonous or a deleterious ingredient which might make the product injurious. It was also denied that there were substances known as coca and cola 'under their own distinctive names,' and it was averred that the product did contain 'certain elements or substances derived from coca leaves and cola nuts.' The answer also set forth, in substance, that 'Coca Cola' was the 'distinctive name' of the product under which it had been known and sold for more than twenty years as an article of food, with other averments negativing adulteration and misbranding under the provisions of the act.\n Jury trial was demanded, and voluminous testimony was taken. The district judge directed a verdict for the claimant (191 Fed. 431), and judgment entered accordingly was affirmed on writ of error by the circuit court of appeals (132 C. C. A. 47, 215 Fed. 535). And the government now prosecutes this writ.\n First. As to 'adulteration.' The claimant, in its summary of the testimony, states that the article in question 'is a syrup manufactured by the claimant . . . and sold and used as a base for soft drinks both at soda fountains and in bottles. The evidence shows that the article contains sugar, water, caffeine, glycerine, lime juice, and other flavoring matters. As used by the consumer, about 1 ounce of this syrup is taken in a glass mixed with \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 272]\n\u00a0\n about 7 ounces of carbonated water, so that the consumer gets in an 8- ounce glass or bottle of the beverage, about 1.21 grains of caffeine.' It is said that in the year 1886 a pharmacist in Atlanta 'compounded a syrup by a secret formula, which he called 'Coca-Cola Syrup and Extract;\" that the claimant acquired 'the formula, name, label, and good will for the product' in 1892, and then registered 'a trademark for the syrup consisting of the name Coca Cola,' and has since manufactured and sold then syrup under that name. The proportion of caffeine was slightly diminished in the preparation of the article for bottling purposes. The claimant again registered the name 'Coco Cola' as a trademark in 1905, averring that the mark had been 'in actual use as a trademark of the applicant for more than ten years next preceding the passage of the act of February 20, 1905,' and that it was believed such use had been exclusive. It is further stated that, in manufacturing in accordance with the formula, 'certain extracts from the leaves of the coca shrub and the nut kernels of the cola tree were used for the purpose of obtaining a flavor,' and that 'the ingredient containing these extracts,' with cocaine eliminated, is designated as 'Merchandise No. 5.' It appears that in the manufacturing process water and sugar are boiled to make a syrup; there are four meltings; in the second or third the caffeine is put in; after the meltings the syrup is conveyed to a cooling tank and then to a mixing tank, where the other ingredients are introduced and the final combination is effected; and from the mixing tank the finished product is drawn off into barrels for shipment.\n The questions with respect to the charge of 'adulteration' are (1) whether the caffeine in the article was an added ingredient within the meaning of the act ( 7, subdiv. 5th), and, if so, (2) whether it was a poisonous or deleterious ingredient which might render the article injurious to health. The decisive ruling in the courts below re- \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 273]\n\u00a0\n sulted from a negative answer to the first question. Both the district judge and the circuit court of appeals assumed for the purpose of the decision that as to the second question there was a conflict of evidence which would require its submission to the jury. (191 Fed. 433, 132 C. C. A. 47, 215 Fed. 540.) But it was concluded, as the claimant contended, that the caffeine-even if it could be found by the jury to have the alleged effect-could not be deemed to be an 'added ingredient' for the reason that the article was a compound, known and sold under its own distinctive name, of which the caffeine was a usual and normal constituent. The government challenges this ruling and the construction of the statute upon which it depends; and the extreme importance of the question thus presented with respect to the application of the act to articles of food sold under tradenames is at once apparent. The government insists that the fact that a formula has been made up and followed and a distinctive name adopted does not suffice to take an article from the reach of the statute; that the standard by which the combination in such a case is to be judged is not necessarily the combination itself; that a poisonous or deleterious ingredient with the stated injurious effect may still be an added ingredient in the statutory sense, although it is covered by the formula and made a constituent of the article sold.\n The term 'food,' as used in the statute, includes 'all articles used for food, drink, confectionery, or condiment . . . whether simple, mixed, or compound' ( 6). An article of 'food' is to be deemed to be 'adulterated' if it contain 'any added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredient which may render such article injurious to health.' ( 7, subdiv. 5th1). With this \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 274]\n\u00a0\n section is to be read the proviso in  8, to the effect that 'an article of food which does not contain any added poisonous or deleterious ingredients shall not be deemed to be adulterated or misbranded' in the case of 'mixtures or compounds which may be now or from time to time hereafter known as articles of food, under their own distinctive names,' if the distinctive name of another article is not used or imitated, and the name on the label or brand is accompanied with a statement of the place of production. And  8 concludes with a further proviso that nothing in the act shall be construed 'as requiring or compelling proprietors or manufacturers of proprietary foods which\n___ 'Third. If any valuable constituent of the article has been wholly or in part abstracted.\n'Fourth. If it be mixed, colored, powdered, coated, or stained in a manner whereby damage or inferiority is concealed.\n\n'Fifth. If it contain any added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredient which may render such article injurious to health: Provided, That when in the preparation of food products for shipment they are preserved by any external application applied in such manner that the preservative is necessarily removed mechanically, or by maceration in water, or otherwise, and directions for the removal of said preservative shall be printed on the covering or the package, the provisions of this act shall be construed as applying only when said products are ready for consumption.\n\n'Sixth. If it consists in whole or in part of a filthy, decomposed, or putrid animal or vegetable substance, or any portion of an animal unfit for food, whether manufactured or not, or if it is the product of a diseased animal, or one that has died otherwise than by slaughter.' \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 275]\n\u00a0\n contain no unwholesome added ingredient to disclose their trade formulas, except in so far as the provisions of this act may require to secure freedom from adulteration or misbranding.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[241 U.S. 265, 276]\n\u00a0\n In support of the ruling below, emphasis is placed upon the general purpose of the act, which, it is said, was to prevent deception, rather than to protect the public health by prohibiting traffic in articles which might be determined to be deleterious. But a description of the purpose of the statute would be inadequate which failed to take account of the design to protect the public from lurking dangers caused by the introduction of harmful ingredients, or which assumed that this end was sought to be achieved by simply requiring certain disclosures. The statute is entitled, 'An Act for Preventing the Manufacture, Sale, or Transportation of Adulterated or Misbranded or Poisonous or Deleterious Foods, Drugs, Medicines, and Liquors,' etc. In the case of confectionery, we find that it is to be deemed to be adulterated if it contains certain specified substances 'or other ingredient deleterious or detrimental to health.' So, under  7, subdivision 6th, there may be adulteration of food in case the article consists in whole or in part of 'any portion of an animal unfit for food, whether manufactured or not, or if it is the product of a diseased animal, or one that has died otherwise than by slaughter.' In United States v. Lexington Mill & Elevator Co. \n232 \nU.S. 399, 409\n, 58 S. L. ed. 658, 661, L.R.A.1915B, 774, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337, it was said that 'the statute upon its face shows that the primary purpose of Congress was to prevent injury to the public health by the sale and transporta- \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 277]\n\u00a0\n tion in interstate commerce of misbranded and adulterated foods. The legislation, as against misbranding, intended to make it possible that the consumer should know that an article purchased was what it purported to be; that it might be bought for what it really was, and not upon misrepresentations as to character and quality. As against adulteration, the statute was intended to protect the public health from possible injury by adding to articles of food consumption poisonous and deleterious substances which might render such articles injurious to the health of consumers.' See also United States v. Antikamnia Co. \n231 \nU.S. 654, 665\n, 58 S. L. ed. 419, 424, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 49; H. R. Report, No. 2118, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., 6-9. It is true that in executing these purposes Congress has limited its prohibitions (Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 529\n, 532 S., 56 L. ed. 1182, 1193, 1194, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 715), and has specifically defined what shall constitute adulteration or misbranding; but, in determining the scope of specific provisions, the purpose to protect the public health, as an important aim of the statute, must not be ignored.\n\n Reading the provisions here in question in the light of the context, we observe:\n\n\n (a)\n That the term 'adulteration' is used in a special sense. For example, the product of a diseased animal may not be adulterated in the ordinary or strict meaning of the word, but by reason of its being that product the article is adulterated within the meaning of the act. The statute with respect to 'adulteration' and 'misbranding' has its own glossary. We cannot, therefore, assume that simply because a prepared 'food' has its formula and distinctive name, it is not, as such, 'adulterated.' In the case of confectionery, it is plain that the article may be 'adulterated' although it is made in strict accordance with some formula and bears a fanciful tradename, if in fact it contains an 'ingredient deleterious or detrimental to health, or any vinous, malt, or spirituous liquor or compound or narcotic drug.' And the context clearly indicates that, \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 278]\n\u00a0\n with respect to articles of food, the ordinary meaning of 'adulteration' cannot be regarded as controlling.\n\n\n (b)\n The provision in  7, subdivision 5th, assumes that the substance which renders the article injurious, and the introduction of which causes 'adulteration,' is an ingredient of the article. It must be an 'added' ingredient; but it is still an ingredient. Component parts, or constituents, of the article which is the subject of the described traffic, are thus not excluded, but are included in the definition. The article referred to in subdivision 5th is the article sought to be made an article of commerce, -the article which 'contains' the ingredient.\n\n\n (c)\n 'Adulteration' is not to be confused with 'misbranding.' The fact that the provisions as to the latter require a statement of certain substances if contained in an article of food, in order to avoid 'misbranding,' does not limit the explicit provisions of  7 as to adulteration. Both provisions are operative. Had it been the intention of Congress to confine its definition of adulteration to the introduction of the particular substances specified in the section as to misbranding, it cannot be doubted that this would have been stated, but Congress gave a broader description of ingredients in defining 'adulteration.' It is 'any' added poisonous or 'other added deleterious ingredient,' provided it 'may render such article injurious to health.'\n\n\n (d)\n Proprietary foods, sold under distinctive names, are within the purview of the provision. Not only is 'food' defined as including articles used for food or drink, 'whether simple, mixed, or compound,' but the intention to include 'proprietary foods' sold under distinctive names is manifest from the provisos in  8 which the claimant invokes. 'Mixtures or compounds' which satisfy the first paragraph of the proviso are not only 'articles of food,' but are to enjoy the stated immunity only in case they do 'not contain any added poisonous or deleterious \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 279]\n\u00a0\n ingredients.' By the concluding clause of  8, it is provided that nothing in the act shall be construed to require manufacturers of 'proprietary foods' to disclose 'their trade formulas' except in so far as the provisions of the act 'may require to secure freedom from adulteration or misbranding;' and the immunity is conditioned upon the fact that such foods 'contain no unwholesome added ingredient.' Thus the statute contemplates that mixtures or compounds manufactured by those having trade formulas, and bearing distinctive names, may nevertheless contain 'added ingredients' which are poisonous or deleterious and may make the article injurious, and, if so, the article is not taken out of the condemnation of  7, subdiv. 5th.\n\n\n (e)\n Again, articles of food, including 'proprietary foods' which fall within this condemnation, are not saved because they were already on the market when the statute was passed. The act makes no such distinction; and it is to be observed that the proviso of  8 explicitly refers to 'mixtures or compounds which may be now or from time to time hereafter known as articles of food.' Nor does the length of the period covered by the traffic, or its extent, affect the question if the article is in fact adulterated within the meaning of the act.\n Having these considerations in mind we deem it to be clear that, whatever difficulties there may be in construing the provision, the claimant's argument proves far too much. We are not now dealing with the question whether the caffeine did, or might, render the article in question injurious; that is a separate inquiry. The fundamental contention of the claimant, as we have seen, is that a constituent of a food product having a distinctive name cannot be an 'added' ingredient. In such case, the standard is said to be the food product itself which the name designates. It must be, it is urged, this 'finished product' that is 'adulterated.' In that view, there would \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 280]\n\u00a0\n seem to be no escape from the conclusion that, however poisonous or deleterious the introduced ingredient might be, and however injurious its effect, if it be made a constituent of a product having its own distinctive name it is not within the provision. If this were so, the statute would be reduced to an absurdity. Manufacturers would be free, for example, to put arsenic or strychnine or other poisonous or deleterious ingredients with an unquestioned injurious effect into compound articles of food, provided the compound were made according to formula and sold under some fanciful name which would be distinctive. When challenged upon the ground that the poison was an 'added' ingredient, the answer would be that without it the so-called food product would not be the product described by the name. Further, if an article purporting to be an ordinary food product, sold under its ordinary name, were condemned because of some added deleterious ingredient, it would be difficult to see why the same result could not be attained with impunity by composing a formula and giving a distinctive name to the article with the criticized substance as a component part. We think that an analysis of the statute shows such a construction of the provision to be inadmissible. Certain incongruities may follow from any definition of the word 'added,' but we cannot conclude that it was the intention of Congress to afford immunity by the simple choice of a formula and a name. It does not seem to us to be a reasonable construction that in the case of 'proprietary foods' manufactured under secret formulas Congress was simply concerned with additions to what such formulas might embrace. Undoubtedly, it was not desired needlessly to embarrass manufacturers of 'proprietary foods' sold under distinctive names, but it was not the purpose of the act to protect articles of this sort regardless of their character. Only such food products as contain 'no unwholesome added ingredient' are within the saving clause, and \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 281]\n\u00a0\n in using the words quoted we are satisfied that Congress did not make the proprietary article its own standard.\n Equally extreme and inadmissible is the suggestion that where a 'proprietary food' would not be the same without the harmful ingredient, to eliminate the latter would constitute an 'adulteration' under  7, subdivision 3d, by the abstraction of a 'valuable constituent.' In that subdivision Congress evidently refers to articles of food which normally are not within the condemnation of the act. Congress certainly did not intend that a poisonous or deleterious ingredient which made a proprietary food an enemy to the public health should be treated as a 'valuable constituent,' or to induce the continued use of such injurious ingredients by making their elimination an adulteration, subject to the penalties of the statute.\n It is apparent, however, that Congress, in using the word 'added,' had some distinction in view. In the Senate bill (for which the measure as adopted was a substitute) there was a separate clause relating to 'liquors,' providing that the article should be deemed to be adulterated if it contained 'any added ingredient of a poisonous or deleterious character;' while in the case of food (which was defined as excluding liquors) the article was to be deemed to be 'adulterated' if it contained 'any added poisonous or other ingredient which may render such article injurious to human health.' Cong. Rec., 59th Cong., 1st Sess. vol. 40, p. 897. In explaining the provision as to 'liquors,' Senator Heyburn, the chairman of the Senate committee having the bill in charge, stated to the Senate (Id., p. 2647): 'The word 'added,' after very mature consideration by your committee, was adopted because of the fact that there is to be found in nature's products as she produces them, poisonous substances to be determined by analysis. Nature has so combined them that they are not a danger or an evil,-that is, so long as they are left in \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 282]\n\u00a0\n the chemical connection in which nature has organized them; but when they are extracted by the artificial processes of chemistry they become a poison. You can extract poison from grain or its products and when it is extracted it is a deadly poison; but if you leave that poison as nature embodied it in the original substances, it is not a dangerous poison or an active agency of poison at all. So, in order to avoid the threat that those who produce a perfectly legitimate article from a natural product might be held liable because the product contained nature's poison, it was thought sufficient to provide against the adding of any new substance that was in itself a poison, and thus emphasizing the evils of existing conditions in nature's product. That is the reason the word 'added' is in the bill. Fusel oil is a poison. If you extract it, it becomes a single active agency of destruction, but allow it to remain in the combination where nature has placed it, and, while it is nominally a poison, it is a harmless one, or comparatively so.' For the Senate bill, the House of Representatives substituted a measure which had the particular provisions now under consideration in substantially the same form in which they were finally enacted into law. ( 7, subdiv. 5th;  8, subdiv. 4th, provisos.) And the committee of the House of Representatives, in reporting this substituted measure, said (H. R. Report, No. 2118, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 6, 7, 11): 'The purpose of the pending measure is not to compel people to consume particular kinds of foods. It is not to compel manufacturers to produce particular kinds or grades of foods. One of the principal objects of the bill is to prohibit in the manufacture of foods intended for interstate commerce the addition of foreign substances poisonous or deleterious to health. The bill does not relate to any natural constituents of food products which are placed in the foods by nature itself. It is well known that in many kinds of foods in their natural state some quantity of poisonous \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 283]\n\u00a0\n or deleterious ingredients exist. How far these substances may be deleterious to health when the food articles containing them are consumed may be a subject of dispute between the scientists, but the bill reported does not in any way consider that question. If, however, poisonous or deleterious substances are added by man to the food product, then the bill declares the article to be adulterated, and forbids interstate traffic.'\n This statement throws light upon the intention of Congress. Illustrations are given to show possible incongruous results of the test, but they do not outweigh this deliberate declaration of purpose; nor do we find in the subsequent legislative history of the substituted measure containing the provision any opposing statement as to the significance of the phrase. It must also be noted that some of the illustrations which are given lose their force when it is remembered that the statutory ban ( 7, subdiv. 5th) by its explicit terms only applies where the added ingredient may render the article injurious to health. See United States v. Lexington Mill & Elevator Co. \n232 \nU.S. 399, 409\n, 58 S. L. ed. 658, 661, L.R.A. 1915B, 774, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337. It is urged that whatever may be said of natural food products, or simple food products, to which some addition is made, a 'proprietary food' must necessarily be 'something else than the simple or natural article;' that it is an 'artificial preparation.' It is insisted that every ingredient in such a compound cannot be deemed to be an 'added' ingredient. But this argument, and the others that are advanced, do not compel the adoption of the asserted alternative as to the saving efficacy of the formula. Nor can we accept the view that the word 'added' should be taken as referring to the quantity of the ingredient used. It is added ingredient which the statute describes, not added quantity of the ingredient, although of course quantity may be highly important in determining whether the ingredient may render the article harmful, and experience in the use of ordinary articles of \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 284]\n\u00a0\n food may be of greatest value in dealing with such questions of fact.\n Congress, we think, referred to ingredients artificially introduced; these it described as 'added.' The addition might be made to a natural food product or to a compound. If the ingredient thus introduced was of the character and had the effect described, it was to make no difference whether the resulting mixture or combination was or was not called by a new name or did or did not constitute a proprietary food. It is said that the preparation might be 'entirely new.' But Congress might well suppose that novelty would probably be sought by the use of such ingredients, and that this would constitute a means of deception and a menace to health from which the public should be protected. It may also have been supposed that, ordinarily, familiar food bases would be used for this purpose. But, however the compound purporting to be an article of food might be made up, we think that it was the intention of Congress that the artificial introduction of ingredients of a poisonous or deleterious character which might render the article injurious to health should cause the prohibition of the statute to attach.\n In the present case, the article belongs to a familiar group; it is a syrup. It was originally called 'Coco-Cola Syrup and Extract.' It is produced by melting sugar,-the analysis showing that 52.64 per cent of the product is sugar and 42.63 per cent is water. Into the syrup thus formed by boiling the sugar, there are introduced coloring, flavoring, and other ingredients, in order to give the syrup a distinctive character. The caffeine, as has been said, is introduced in the second or third 'melting.' We see no escape from the conclusion that it is an 'added' ingredient within the meaning of the statute.\n Upon the remaining question whether the caffeine was a poisonous or deleterious ingredient which might render the article injurious to health, there was a decided conflict \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 285]\n\u00a0\n of competent evidence. The government's experts gave testimony to the effect that it was, and the claimant introduced evidence to show the contrary. It is sufficient to say that the question was plainly one of fact which was for the consideration of the jury. See 443 Cans of Frozen Egg Product v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 172, 183\n, 57 S. L. ed. 174, 179, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 50.\n Second. As to 'misbranding.' In the second count it was charged that the expression 'Coca Cola' represented the presence in the product of the substances coca and cola, and that it contained 'no coca and little if any cola.' So far as 'cola' was concerned, the charge was vague and indefinite, and this seems to have been conceded by the government at the beginning of the trial. With respect to 'coca,' there was evidence on the part of the government tending to show that there was nothing in the product obtained from the leaves of the coca plant, while on behalf of the claimant it was testified that the material called 'Merchandise No. 5' (one of the ingredients) was obtained from both coca leaves and cola nuts. It was assumed on the motion for a peremptory instruction that there might be a disputed question of fact as to whether the use of the word 'coca' is to be regarded 'intrinsically and originally' as stating or suggesting the presence of 'some material element or quality' derived from coca leaves, and it was also assumed that the evidence might be deemed to be conflicting with respect to the question whether the product actually contained anything so derived. 191 Fed. 438, 439. But these issues of fact were considered not to be material. On this branch of the case, the claimant succeeded upon the ground that its article was within the protection of the proviso in  8 as one known 'under its own distinctive name.' 132 C. C. A. 47, 215 Fed. 544.\n Section 8 (ante, p. 275), in its 4th specification as to 'food,' provides that the article shall be deemed to be 'misbranded' 'if the package containing it or its label shall \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 286]\n\u00a0\n bear any statement, design, or device regarding the ingredients or the substances contained therein, which . . . shall be false or misleading in any particular.' Then follows the proviso in question that an article not containing any added poisonous or deleterious ingredients 'shall not be deemed to be . . . misbranded' in the case of 'mixtures or compounds which may be now or from time to time hereafter known as articles of food, under their own distinctive names, and not an imitation of or offered for sale under the distinctive name of another article,' if the name is accompanied with a statement of the place where the article has been produced. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n A distinctive name is a name tnat distinguishes. It may be a name in common use as a generic name, e. g., \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 287]\n\u00a0\n coffee, flour, etc. Where there is a trade description of this sort by which a product of a given kind is distinctively known to the public, it matters not that the name had originally a different significance. Thus, soda water is a familiar trade description of an article which now, as is well known, rarely contains soda in any form. Such a name is not to be deemed either 'misleading' or 'false,' as it is in fact distinctive. But unless the name is truly distinctive, the immunity cannot be enjoyed; it does not extend to a case where an article is offered for sale 'under the distinctive name of another article.' Thus, that which is not coffee, or is an imitation of coffee, cannot be sold as coffee; and it would not be protected by being called 'X's Coffee.' Similarly, that which is not lemon extract could not obtain immunity by being sold under the name of 'Y's Lemon Extract.' The name so used is not 'distinctive,' as it does not appropriately distinguish the product; it is an effort to trade under the name of an article of a different sort. So, with respect to 'mixtures or compounds,' we think that the term 'another article' in the proviso embraces different compounds from the compound in question. The aim of the statute is to prevent deception, and that which appropriately describes a different compound cannot secure protection as a 'distinctivename.'\n A 'distinctive name' may also, of course, be purely arbitrary or fanciful, and thus, being the trade description of the particular thing, may satisfy the statute, provided the name has not already been appropriated for something else so that its use would tend to deceive.\n If, in the present case, the article had been named 'Coca,' and it were found that the name was actually descriptive in the sense that it fairly implied that the article was derived from the leaves of the coca plant, it could not be said that this was 'its own distinctive name' if in fact it contained nothing so derived. The \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 288]\n\u00a0\n name, if thus descriptive, would import a different product from the one to which it was actually affixed. And, in the case supposed, the name would not become the 'distinctive name' of a product without any coca ingredient unless in popular acceptation it came to be regarded as identifying a product known to be of that character. It would follow that the mere sale of the product under the name 'Coca.' and the fact that this was used as a trade designation of the product, would not suffice to show that it had ceased to have its original significance if it did not appear that it had become known to the public that the article contained nothing derived from coca. Until such knowledge could be attributed to the public, the name would naturally continue to be descriptive in the original sense. Nor would it be controlling that at the time of the adoption of the name the coca plant was known only to foreigners and scientists; for if the name had appropriate reference to that plant and to substances derived therefrom, its use would primarily be taken in that sense by those who did know or who took pains to inform themselves of its meaning. Mere ignorance on the part of others as to the nature of the composition would not change the descriptive character of the designation. The same conclusion would be reached if the single name 'Cola' had been used as the name of the product, and it were found that in fact the name imported that the product was obtained from the cola nut. The name would not be the distinctive name of a product not so derived until in usage it achieved that secondary significance.\n We are thus brought to the question whether, if the names coca and cola were respectively descriptive, as the government contends, a combination of the two names constituted a 'distinctive name' within the protection of the proviso in case either of the described ingredients was absent. It is said that 'coca' indicates one \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 289]\n\u00a0\n article, and 'cola' another, but that the two names together did not constitute the distinctive name of any other substance or combination of substances. The contention leads far. To take the illustration suggested in argument, it would permit a manufacturer, who could not use the name chocolate to describe that which was not chocolate, or vanilla to describe that which was not vanilla, to designate a mixture as 'Chocolate-Vanilla,' although it was destitute of either or both, provided the combined name had not been previously used. We think that the contention misses the point of the proviso. A mixture or compound may have a name descriptive of its ingredients or an arbitrary name. The latter (if not already appropriated) being arbitrary, designates the particular product. Names, however, which are merely descriptive of ingredients, are not primarily distinctive names save as they appropriately describe the compound with such ingredients. To call the compound by a name descriptive of ingredients which are not present is not to give it 'its own distinctive name,'-which distinguishes it from other compounds,-but to give it the name of a different compound. That, in our judgment, is not protected by the proviso, unless the name has achieved a secondary significance as descriptive of a product known to be destitute of the ingredients indicated by its primary meaning.\n In the present case we are of opinion that it could not be said as matter of law that the name was not primarily descriptive of a compound with coca and cola ingredients, as charged. Nor is there basis for the conclusion that the designation had attained a secondary meaning as the name of a compound from which either coca or cola ingredients were known to be absent; the claimant has always insisted, and now insists, that its product contains both. But if the name was found to be descriptive, as charged, there was clearly a conflict of evidence with respect to the presence of any coca ingredient. We con- \n\n[241 U.S. 265, 290]\n\u00a0\n clude that the court erred in directing a verdict on the second count.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for furthere proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 7, with respect to 'confectionery' and 'food' is as follows:\n'Sec. 7.

Stat. 1913,  1704) to review a decision of the district court for the western district of Washington (228 Fed. 980), sustaining a demurrer to an indictment founded on the 'white slave traffic act' (36 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 395, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8817).\n Section 6 of that act provides that everyone 'who shall keep, maintain, control, support or harbor in any house or place, for the purpose of prostitution, . . . any alien woman . . . within three years after she shall have entered the United States . . . shall file with the Commissioner General of Immigration a statement in writing setting forth the name of such alien woman, . . . the place at which she is kept, and all facts as to the date of her entry into the United States, the port through which she entered, her age, nationality, and parentage, and concerning her procuration to come to this country, within the knowledge of such person; and any person who shall fail within thirty days after such person shall commence to keep, etc. . . . any alien woman, . . . to file \n\n[241 U.S. 73, 75]\n\u00a0\n such statement concerning such alien woman, . . . with the Commissioner General of Immigration, or who shall knowingly and wilfully state falsely, or fail to disclose in such statement any fact within his knowledge or belief with reference to the age, nationality, or parentage of any such alien woman, . . . or concerning her procuration to come to this country, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, etc., . . .'\n The statement is not excused because it may have incriminating character, but it is provided that the person making it shall not be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture under any law of the United States for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he may truthfully report in such statement as required by the provisions of the act.\n The indictment charged that one Jessie Milos, an alien woman and a citizen and subject of the Kingdom of Great Britain, had entered the United States in the month of May, 1914, and that Angeline Lombardo, knowing these facts, did, in a house in the city of Seattle, northern division of the western district of Washington, keep, maintain, control, and harbor Jessie Milos for the purpose of prostitution and for other immoral purposes, and unlawfully, knowingly, and wilfully failed to file with the Commissioner General of Immigration a statement in writing as required by the statute, or any statement concerning Jessie Milos.\n It was alleged that the United States and Great Britain are parties to an agreement or project or arrangement for the suppression of the white slave traffic, adopted July 25, 1902\n\n\n There were two grounds of demurrer: (1) Section 6 of the white slave act is unconstitutional in that it contravenes rights guaranteed by the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. (2) The court was without jurisdiction of the subject- \n\n[241 U.S. 73, 76]\n\u00a0\n matter as the prosecution is in contravention of rights guaranteed by the 6th Amendment.\n The district court sustained the demurrer on both grounds. We, however, shall confine our decision to the second ground, as that attacked the jurisdiction of the court, in that the offense was not committed in the district in which the indictment was found. Passing on it the court said:\n'The gist of the offense is the failure 'to file with the Commissioner General of Immigration' a statement, etc. By act of March 3, 1891, chap. 551,  7, 26 Stat. at L. page 1085, Comp. Stat. 1913,  954, as amended by act of March 2, 1895, chap. 177, 28 Stat. at L. page 780, Comp. Stat. 1913,  955, the office of the Commissioner of Immigration was created and his office fixed at Washington, District of Columbia. The government contends that the offense was a continuing one and extended from this district to Washington, District of Columbia, and that the filing of the statement need not be at the office in Washington, but may be deposited in the postoffice of the United States, addressed to the Commissioner General, and this forwarding through the usual course of mail should be considered as 'filing,' and that the failure to post within thirty days would commence the offense, which would be continuous. This contention cannot be reconciled with the language employed in the act. The word 'file' was not defined by Congress. No definition having been given, the etymology of the word must be considered and ordinary meaning applied. The word 'file' is derived from the Latin word 'filum,' and relates to the ancient practice of placing papers on a thread or wire for safe-keeping and ready reference. Filing, it must be observed, is not complete until the document is delivered and received. 'Shall file' means to deliver to the office, and not send through the United States mails. Gates v. State, 128 N. Y. 221, 28 N. E. 373. A paper is filed when it is delivered to the proper official and by him received and filed. Bouvier's \n\n[241 U.S. 73, 77]\n\u00a0\n Law Dict.; Hoyt v. Stark, 134 Cal. 178, 86 Am. St. Rep. 246, 66 Pac. 223; Wescott v. Eccles, 3 Utah, 258, 2 Pac. 525; Re Von Borcke (D. C.) 94 Fed. 352; Mutual L. Ins. Co. v. Phinney, 22 C. C. A. 425, 48 U. S. App. 78, 76 Fed. 618. Anything short of delivery would leave the filing a disputable fact, and that would not be consistent with the spirit of the act.'\n\n The government in its argument here contests the views of the district court, repeats its contention that the offense was begun in the state of Washington, and relies on  42 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1100, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1024], substantially reproducing  731 of the Revised Statutes. It provides as follows:\n'When any offense against the United States is begun in one judicial district and completed in another, it shall be deemed to have been committed in either, and may be dealt with, inquired of, tried, determined and punished in either district, in the same manner as if it had been actually and wholly committed therein.'\n\n The government also cites a number of cases which it urges support the application of the statute to the case at bar. We are unable so to regard the cases, or to give the statute the application contended for. Nor does the case call for elaborate discussion. Indeed, it would be difficult to add anything to the reasoning of Judge Neterer in the district court.\n Undoubtedly where a crime consists of distinct parts which have different localities the whole may be tried where any part can be proved to have been done; or where it may be said there is a continuously moving act, commencing with the offender and hence ultimately consummated through him, as the mailing of a letter; or where there is a confederation in purpose between two or more persons, its execution being by acts elsewhere, as in conspiracy.\n It may be that where there is a general duty it may be considered as insistent both where the 'actor' is and the 'subject' is, to borrow the government's apt designa- \n\n[241 U.S. 73, 78]\n\u00a0\n tions, as in the case of the duty of a father to support his children; and if the duty have criminal sanction, it may be enforced in either place. The principle is not applicable where there is a place explicitly designated by law, as in  6.\n The government, however, contends that 'with few exceptions every crime has continuity. But the law, being essentially practical, does not regard every crime as continuous for the purpose of jurisdiction. . . . For practical purposes it usually suffices to punish where the actor began, or where the subject suffered the intended result.'\n If these propositions be granted we do not see that they carry us far in determining where a violation of  6 is begun or completed, nor do we appreciate the criticism of the decision of the court below that it 'failed to distinguish between the 'beginning' and the 'completion' of the offense; giving the words 'shall file,' etc., a meaning so narrow as to destroy the section.' But this is assertion. A court is constrained by the meaning of the words of a statute. They mark the extent of its power, and our attention has not been called to any case which decides that the requirement of a statute, whether to secure or preserve a right or to avoid the guilt of a crime, that a paper shall be filed with a particular officer, is satisfied by a deposit in the postoffice at some distant place. To so hold would create revolutions in the procedure of the law and the regulation of rights. In instances it might, indeed, be convenient; in others, and most others, it would result in confusion and controversies; and we would have the clash of oral testimonies for the certain evidence of the paper in the files. We hesitate, in order to accommodate the venue of a particular offense, to introduce such confusion. And would it not, besides, in particular cases, preclude the possibility of a conviction, putting evidence entirely in the hands of the defendant? \n\n[241 U.S. 73, 79]\n\u00a0\n And there are other considerations. If depositing in the postoffice of the statement prescribed be required by the statute, it, of course, would satisfy the statute, but to what instant of time would it be referred and at what risk the time or delays of transportation?\n There need not be a prolonged embarrassment in the prosecution of offenders, as the government fears. If  6 is deemed defective it can be corrected by legislation.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","218":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

By the act of February 14, 1859, chap. 33 (11 Stat. at L. 383, Comp. Stat. 1913,  6799 (42)), for the admission of Oregon into the Union, it was provided ( 4):\n'That the following propositions be, and the same are hereby, offered to the said people of Oregon for their free acceptance or rejection, which, if accepted, shall be obligatory on the United States and upon the said state of Oregon, to wit: First, That sections numbered sixteen and thirty- six in every township of public lands in said state, and where either of said sections, or any part thereof, has been sold or otherwise been disposed of, other lands equivalent thereto, and as contiguous as may be, shall be granted to said state for the use of schools. . . . Provided, however, That in case any of the lands herein granted to the state of Oregon have heretofore been confirmed to the territory of Oregon for the purposes specified in this act, the amount so confirmed shall be deducted from the quantity specified in this act.'\n\n The propositions of the enabling act were accepted by the legislative assembly of the state of Oregon on June 3, 1859. 1 Lord's Oregon Laws, pp. 28, 29.\n There was a stipulation of facts, in substance, as follows:\n Prior to May 27, 1902, no survey of any kind had been made by the United States of the lands in question. On June 2, 1902, a filed survey was made under the direction of the United States surveyor general of Oregon. This officer approved the survey on June 2, 1903, and on June 8, 1903, transmitted copies of plat of survey and field notes to the Commissioner of the General Land Office. On October 13, 1904, the Commissioner informed the surveyor general that the deputy had failed to describe \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 197]\n\u00a0\n the kind of instrument used in the execution of the work, or to record any polaris or solar observations at that time, and that a supplemental report would be necessary. Additional field notes were transmitted to the Commissioner on September 8, 1905. The Commissioner accepted the survey on January 31, 1906. In view of reports of illegal settlement, it was directed that no entries should be allowed until further permission, as the survey was accepted 'for payment only.' The plat was received in the local land office on February 7, 1906. On November 16, 1907, the suspension was revoked, and the surveyor general of Oregon was directed to place the plat on file in the local land office, and it was filed accordingly in substantially the same form in which it had been accepted by the surveyor general 'without change or correction.' On December 16, 1905, the Secretary of the Interior 'temporarily withdrew for forestry purposes from all forms of disposition whatsoever, except under the mineral laws of the United States, all the vacant and unappropriated public lands' within described areas, which include the land in controversy. Notice of this withdrawal was given on December 19, 1905, to the register and receiver of the local land office. In taking this action the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner described the lands 'according to the rectangular system of government survey.' On January 25, 1907, the President issued a proclamation enlarging the Cascade Range Forest Reserve so as to include the section sixteen in question and other lands. This proclamation, by its terms, excepted 'all lands which at this date are embraced within any withdrawal or reservation for any use or purpose to which this reservation for forest uses is inconsistent.' 34 Stat. at L. 3270\n\n\n It was the contention of the government that, by reason of the withdrawal by executive order for forestry purposes prior to the acceptance of the survey by the \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 198]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner of the General Land Office, the title to the lands did not pass to the state under the school grant. The appellees claimed title under a conveyance from the state, its certificates of sales having been executed on October 10, 1906, and its deed on January, 9, 1907. Decree in favor of the United States (United States v. Cowlishaw, 202 Fed. 317) was reversed by the circuit court of appeals (Morrison v. United States, 128 C. C. A. 485, 212 Fed. 29), and the government appeals to this court.\n The first enactment for the sale of public lands in the western territory provided for setting apart section 16 of every township for the maintenance of public schools (ordinance of 1785; Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, 177, 15 L. ed. 338, 339); and, in carrying out this policy, grants were made for common-school purposes to each of the public-land states admitted to the Union. Between the years 1802 and 1846 the grants were of every section 16,1 and, thereafter, of sections 16 and 36.2 In some instances, additional sections have been granted. In the case of Oregon, the following provision had been made in establishing the territorial government (act of August 14, 1848, chap. 177,  20, 9 Stat. at L. 323, 330):\n'That when the lands in the said territory shall be surveyed under the direction of the government of the United States, preparatory to bringing the same into market, sections numbered sixteen and thirty-six in each \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 199]\n\u00a0\n township in said territory shall be, and the same is hereby, reserved for the purpose of being applied to schools in said territory, and in the states and territories hereafter to be erected out of the same.'\n\n In 1850, Congress created the office of surveyor general of the public lands in Oregon, and provided for survey and for donations to settlers (act of September 27, 1850, chap. 76, 9 Stat. at L. 496), and this act provided ( 9): 'That no claim to a donation right . . . upon sections sixteen or thirty-six, shall be valid or allowed, if the residence and cultivation upon which the same is founded shall have commenced after the survey of the same.' By the act of February 19, 1851, chap. 10 (9 Stat. at L. 568), Congress authorized the legislative assemblies of the territories of Oregon and Minnesota 'to make such laws and needful regulations as they shall deem most expedient to protect from injury and waste sections numbered sixteen and thirty-six . . . reserved in each township for the support of schools therein.' In 1853 (act of January 7, 1853, chap. 6, 10 Stat. at L. 150) the legislative assembly of Oregon was authorized 'in all cases where the sixteen or thirty-six sections, or any part thereof, shall be taken and occupied under the law making donations of land to actual settlers' to select, 'in lieu thereof, an equal quantity of any unoccupied land in sections, or fractional sections, as the case may be.' And these provisions were followed in 1859 by the proposition of the enabling act (supra) accepted by the state of Oregon that these sections 'in every township of public lands' within the state, and 'where either of said sections, or any part thereof, has been sold or otherwise been disposed of, other lands equivalent thereto, and as contiguous as may be, shall be granted to said state for the use of schools.'\n Prior to survey, the designated sections were undefined and the lands were unidentified. It is insisted by the \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 200]\n\u00a0\n appellees that there was a grant in prcesenti, under which the state acquired a vested right in the lands, subject only to identification which would relate back to the date of the grant, and that 'any sale or disposal' subsequent to that date 'was illegal and void.' It will be observed, however, that the language used is not that of a present grant. The expression is 'shall be granted,' and these words are used both with respect to the described sections and to the undefined indemnity lands which would be received in compensation for losses. In the latter case, there was obviously no present grant, and none, we think, was intended in the former. Attention is called to the words 'herein granted' in the proviso of the enabling act, but this is a mere reference to what precedes, and does not change, or purport to change, the terms of the donation. It must have been manifest to Congress, executing this definite policy with respect to the vast area of the public lands, that not improbably a long period would elapse in the case of numerous townships before surveys would be completed. Not only was it inevitable that upon survey there would be found to be fractional townships in which there would be either no section sixteen, or thirty-six, or only a portion of one or the other, but in various instances there might be prior claims, or actual settlements, or it might appear before surveys were had that there were important public interests which, in the judgment of Congress, should be subserved by some other disposition of lands of a particular character. On the other hand, it was not important to the state that it should receive specific lands, if suitable indemnity were given. It was in this situation that, in making its school grants to the public-land states, Congress provided that the described sections, or equivalent lands if the former in whole or in part had 'been sold or otherwise been disposed of,' should be granted. Whether or not provision had already been made for \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 201]\n\u00a0\n the sale or disposition of public lands within the borders of the state at the time of its admission, the language of the school grant was substantially the same. And we think that its import is clear. The designation of these sections was a convenient method of devoting a fixed proportion of public lands to school uses; but Congress, in making its compacts with the states, did not undertake to warrant that the designated sections would exist in every township, or that, if existing, the state should at all events take title to the particular lands found to be therein. Congress did undertake, however, that these sections should be granted unless they had been sold or otherwise disposed of; that is, that on the survey, defining the sections, the title to the lands should pass to the state provided sale or other disposition had not previously been made; and, if it had been made, that the state should be entitled to select equivalent lands for the described purpose.\n By the act of May 20, 1826, chap. 83 (4 Stat. at L. 179, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4861), there had been provision made for compensation in the case of townships and fractional townships, for which the stated appropriation for school purposes had not been made. In 1859, a further act was passed ( Feb. 26, 1859, chap. 58, 11 Stat. at L. 385, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4860), to the effect that where settlement with a view to pre-emption had been made 'before the survey of the lands in the field' on sections 16 or 36, these sections should 'be subject to the pre-emption claim of such settler.' And it was added-'if they, or either of them, shall have been or shall be reserved or pledged for the use of schools or colleges in the state or territory in which the lands lie, other lands of like quantity are hereby appropriated in lieu of such as may be patented by preemptors; and other lands are also hereby appropriated to compensate deficiencies for school purposes where said sections sixteen or thirty-six are fractional in quantity, or where one or both are wanting by \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 202]\n\u00a0\n reason of the township being fractional, or from any natural cause whatever.' These lands were to be selected in accordance with the principles of adjustment defined in the act of 1826. These provisions were incorporated in  2275 and 2276 of the Revised Statutes. (Comp. Stat. 1913,  4860, 4861). And the latter were amended by the act of February 28, 1891, chap. 384 (26 Stat. at L. 796, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4860, 4861), which in part provided: 'And other lands of equal acreage are also hereby appropriated and granted, and may be selected by said state or territory, where sections sixteen or thirty-six are mineral land, or are included within any Indian, military, or other reservation, or are otherwise disposed of by the United States.' In this manner, Congress has undertaken to discharge its obligation by assuring to the states the equivalent of the school-grant sections when these have 'been sold or otherwise been disposed of.'\n The question now presented was not involved in Ham v. Missouri, 18 How. 126, 15 L. ed. 334, or in Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, 15 L. ed. 338. The former case related to the school grant to Missouri under the act of March 6, 1820 (3 Stat. at L. 547, chap. 22, Comp. Stat. 1913,  6799, ( 42)). Ham had been indicted for waste and trespass on the 16th section of one of the townships, and his conviction was affirmed. In defense, he claimed title under a Spanish grant. This had been rejected by the Board of Commissioners in 1811, and it appeared that the United States had full power of disposition at the time of the donation to the state. Referring to the provision for the grant of equivalent lands, to take the place of those 'sold or otherwise disposed of,' the court said: 'Sale, necessarily signifying a legal sale by a competent authority, is a disposition, final and irrevocable, of the land. The phrase 'or otherwise dispose of' must signify some disposition of the property equally efficient, and equally incompatible with any right in the state, present or potential, as deducible from the act of 1820, and the ordinance of the same year.' But in the case cited there \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 203]\n\u00a0\n had been no such disposition. Reliance was placed by Ham upon an act of 1828 (6 Stat. at L. 386, chap. 135) confirming the grant to his predecessors, but this confirmatory act explicitly provided that it should not 'prejudice the rights of third persons, nor any title heretofore derived from the United States, either by purchase or donation.' And it further appeared that the survey had been made of the land in question before the confirmatory act was passed (see 18 How. p. 134). In Cooper v. Roberts, supra, the plaintiff asserted title under the school grant made to Michigan (act of June 23, 1836, 5 Stat. at L. 59, chap. 121). The section 16 in controversy had been surveyed in 1847. Sale had been made by the state in February, 1851, and its patent had issued in November of that year. It was in 1850, after the lands had been surveyed, that the defendant's grantor had applied to the officers of the land office to enter the land, and the entry was allowed in 1852 with a reservation of the rights of Michigan, which the Secretary of the Interior deemed to be superior. It was in these circumstances, it being found that there was no legal impediment through any legislation, that the court held that the title had passed to the state.\n In the case of Heydenfeldt v. Daney Gold & S. Min. Co. \n93 U.S. 634\n, 23 L. ed. 995, 13 Mor. Min. Rep. 204, there had been a disposition of the land under the authority of Congress between the date of the school grant and the date of the survey. This case arose under the school grant to Nevada (act of March 21, 1864, 13 Stat. at L. 30, 32, chap. 36), which was one of the exceptional instances where words of present grant were used, these, however, being qualified by the clause relating to sale or other disposition. The act provided: 'That sections numbers sixteen and thirty- six, in every township, and where such sections have been sold or otherwise disposed of by any act of Congress, other lands equivalent thereto . . . shall be, and are hereby, granted to said state for the support of common schools.' The plaintiff claimed under a patent \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 204]\n\u00a0\n issued by the state of Nevada in 1868. The land was mineral land, and the defendant was in possession, carrying on the mining business, having obtained a patent from the United States under the acts of July 26, 1866 ( 14 Stat. at L. 251, chap. 262), as amended, and May 10, 1872 (17 Stat. at L. 91, chap. 152, Comp. Stat. 1913,  4614). The entry and claim of the defendant's predecessors in interest were made in 1867, prior to the survey of the section in question. It was held that the lands were subject to the disposition of Congress until the survey and its approval; and hence the judgment in favor of the defendant was affirmed. The words of present grant were deemed to be restricted by the words of qualification. The court said that it was intended to place Nevada 'on an equal footing with states then recently admitted. Her people were not interested in getting the identical sections 16 and 36 in every township. Indeed, it could not be known until after a survey where they would fall, and a grant of quantity put her in as good a condition as the other states which had received the benefit of this bounty. A grant, operating at once, and attaching prior to the surveys by the United States, would deprive Congress of the power of disposing of any part of the lands in Nevada, until they were segregated from those granted. In the mean time, further improvements would be arrested, and the persons who, prior to the surveys, had occupied and improved the country, would lose their possessions and labor, in case it turned out that they had settled upon the specified sections. . . . Until the status of the lands was fixed by a survey, and they were capable of identification, Congress reserved absolute power over them; and if, in exercising it, the whole or any part of a 16th or 36th section had been disposed of, the state was to be compensated by other lands equal in quantity, and as near as may be in quality. By this means the state was fully indemnified, the settlers ran no risk of losing the labor of years, and Congress was left \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 205]\n\u00a0\n free to legislate touching the national domain in any way it saw fit, to promote the public interests.' It is said that the Nevada school grant added the words 'by any act of Congress' to the phrase 'otherwise disposed of,' and that the former words are not in the Oregon grant. But this does not mark a distinction, as 'otherwise disposed of,' of course, implies that the disposition shall be by competent authority. It is also urged that the court emphasized the fact that there had been no sale or disposition of the public lands in Nevada prior to the enabling act, and therefore that the clause could refer only to future disposition; whereas, in the case of Oregon, there had been earlier provisions for the disposal of the public domain. But Congress used the same phrase substantially in nearly every one of the school grants, and it was the manifest intention to place the states on the same footing in this matter. The same clause, relating to the same subject, and enacted in pursuance of the same policy, did not have one meaning in one grant and a different meaning in another; it covered other dispositions, whether prior or subsequent, if made before the land had been appropriately identified by survey and title had passed. Nor is a distinction to be observed between mineral lands and other lands, if in fact Congress disposed of them. The validity of the disposition would not be affected by the character of the lands, although this might supply the motive for the action of Congress. We regard the decision in the Heydenfeldt Case as establishing a definite rule of construction.\n In opposition to this definition of the effect of the donation for school purposes, the appellees rely upon what was said in Beecher v. Wetherby, \n95 U.S. 517\n, 24 L. ed. 440. That was an action of replevin to recover logs cut on a section 16 in Wisconsin which had been granted by the enabling act of 1846 (9 Stat. at L. 58, chap. 89, Comp. Stat. 1913,  6799 (42)). The exterior lines of the township in which the land was \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 206]\n\u00a0\n situated were run in October, 1852, and the section lines in May and June, 1854; and the defendant claimed under patents from the state issued in 1865 and 1870. The land had been occupied by the Menominee Indians, but their right was only that of occupancy. 'The fee was in the United States, subject to that right, and could be transferred by them whenever the chose.' By the treaty of 1848 (9 Stat. at L. 952) these Indians agreed to cede to the United States all their lands in Wisconsin, it being stipulated that they should be entitled to remain on the lands for two years. In view of their unwillingness to withdraw, a further act was passed (10 Stat. at L. 1064) by which a tract was assigned to them embracing the land in controversy. Subsequently, a portion of this reservation was assigned by another treaty to the Stockbridge and Munsee tribes, and for the benefit of the latter Congress passed the act of February 6, 1871 (16 Stat. at L. 404, chap. 38), providing for the sale of certain townships. The plaintiff asserted title under patents issued by the United States in 1872 pursuant to this act. It appeared, however, that the Indian occupation of the land had ceased before the logs were cut. The court held that the title had vested in the state, and hence that the plaintiff had acquired no title by his patents from the United States. It was said in the opinion that by the compact with the state (the school grant) the lands were 'withdrawn from any other disposition, and set apart from the public domain, so that no subsequent law authorizing a sale of it could be construed to embrace them, although they were not specially excepted;' and that after this compact 'no subsequent sale or other disposition . . . could defeat the appropriation.' But it was also stated that 'when the logs in suit were cut, those tribes (Stockbridge and Munsee) had removed from the land in controversy, and other sections had been set apart for their occupation.' That is, the lands had been surveyed in 1854; prior to \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 207]\n\u00a0\n that time, there had been no other disposition of the fee by the United States; the title had vested in the state, subject at most to the Indian occupancy, and this had terminated. There was abundant reason for the decision that these lands were not embraced, and were not intended to be embraced, in the provisions for sale made by the act of 1871. What was said in the opinion must be considered in the light of the facts ( Weyerhaeuser v. Hoyt, \n219 \nU.S. 380, 394\n, 55 S. L. ed. 258, 264, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 300). The Heydenfeldt Case was not cited and cannot be regarded as overruled. See New York Indians v. United States, \n170 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 42 S. L. ed. 927, 933, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 531; Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 U.S. 375\n, 399-401, 46 L. ed. 955, 967, 968, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 650.\n The rule which the Heydenfeldt Case established has, we understand, been uniformly followed in the land office. After reviewing the cases, Secretary Lamar concluded (December 6, 1887, Re Colorado, 6 Land Dec. 412, 417) that the school grant 'does not take effect until after survey, and if at that date the sections are in a condition to pass by the grant, the absolute fee to said sections immediately vests in the state, and if at that date said sections have been sold or disposed of, the state takes indemnity therefor.' And see, to the same effect, Niven v. California, 6 Land Dec. 439; State v. Kuhn, 24 Land Dec. 12, 13; State v. Wright, 24 Land Dec. 54, 57; State v. Riley, 34 Land Dec. 657, 660; State v. Thomas, 35 Land Dec. 171, 173; Re F. A. Hyde & Co. 37 Land Dec. 164, 166; Re Montana, 38 Land Dec. 247, 250.\n The case of United States v. Thomas, \n151 U.S. 577\n, 38 L. ed. 276, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 426, involved the Wisconsin school grant, the question being whether the Federal court in that state had jurisdiction to try an Indian charged with the murder of another Indian within the limits of section 16 in a township forming part of an Indian reservation. It appeared that by treaty prior to the enabling act of 1846 the Indians had stipulated for the right of occupancy; that they had never been removed from the lands; and that, by treaty \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 208]\n\u00a0\n of 1854, the particular reservation in question had been established. The lands were not surveyed until 1855. From any point of view it was clear that the title had never vested in the state, except as subordinate to the right of occupation of the Indians, and it was held that the Federal jurisdiction existed. Minnesota v. Hitchcock, supra, was a suit brought by the state to enjoin the Secretary of the Interior from selling any sections 16 and 36 in the Red Lake Indian Reservation, the sales having been authorized by the act of January 14, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 642, chap. 24), which was passed for the relief of the Chippewa Indians. The school grant to Minnesota was made by the enabling act of 1857 (11 Stat. at L. 167, chap. 60, Comp. Stat. 1913,  6799 (42)). The lands in question, however, were not surveyed until after the act of 1889 had been passed, and the agreement it contemplated had been made with the Indians. The court dismissed the bill of the state. It was held that when Congress undertook in 1889 'to make provision for this body of lands, it could have by treaty taken simply a cession of the Indian rights of occupancy, and thereupon the lands would have become public lands and within the scope of the school grant;' but that Congress also 'had the power to make arrangements with the Indians by which the entire tract would be otherwise appropriated. . . . Before any survey of the lands, before the state right had attached to any particular sections, the United States made a treaty or agreement with the Indians, by which they accepted a cession of the entire tract under a trust for its disposition in a particular way.' The Heydenfeldt case was cited with approval. Referring to the joint resolution passed by Congress on March 3, 1857 (11 Stat. at L. 254), to the effect that in case of settlements on the 16th or 36th sections, their selection as town sites, or their reservation for public uses prior to survey, other lands should be selected in lieu thereof \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 209]\n\u00a0\n and to the contention of the state that the 'public uses' thus contemplated were 'governmental uses,' the court said: 'It is unnecessary to rest upon a determination of this question. We refer to the resolution as an express declaration by Congress that the school sections were not granted to the state absolutely, and beyond any further control by Congress, or any further action under the general land laws. As in Heydenfeldt v. Daney Gold & S. Min. Co. supra, priority was given to a mining entry over the state's school right, so here, in terms, preference is given to private entries, town-site entries, or reservations for public uses. In other words, the act of admission, with its clause in respect to school lands, was not a promise by Congress that under all circumstances, either then or in the future, these specific school sections were or should become the property of the state. The possibility of other disposition was contemplated, the right of Congress to make it was recognized, and provision made for a selection of other lands in lieu thereof. In this connection may also be noticed the act of February 28, 1891, although passed after the approval of the agreement for the cession of these lands by the Indians. That act in terms authorized the selection of other lands 'where sections sixteen or thirty-six are mineral land, or are included within any Indian, military, or other reservation, or are otherwise disposed of by the United States.'\n The case of Wisconsin v. Hitchcock, \n201 U.S. 202\n, 50 L. ed. 727, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 498, followed United States v. Thomas, and Minnesota v. Hitchcock, supra. In Alabama v. Schmidt, \n232 U.S. 168\n, 58 L. ed. 555, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 301, there was no question as to the acquisition of title by the state. It was held that, assuming that the state had acquired title to the lands embraced in the school grant, it had authority to subject the lands in its hands to the ordinary incidents of other titles in the state, including that of adverse possession. \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 210]\n\u00a0\n We conclude that the state of Oregon did not take title to the land prior to the survey; and that until the sections were defined by survey and title had vested in the state, Congress was at liberty to dispose of the land, its obligation in that event being properly to compensate the state for whatever deficiencies resulted.\n The remaining question, then, is whether there had been a survey prior to an authorized withdrawal for forestry purposes. The Surveying of the public lands is an administrative act confided to the control of the Commissioner of the General Land Office under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. Act of July 4, 1836, chap. 352, 5 Stat. at L. 107, Rev. Stat.  453, Comp. Stat. 1913,  699. It was competent for the Commissioner, acting within this authority, to direct how surveys should be made, and to require that they should be subject to his examination and approval before they were filed as officially complete in the local land office. Cragin v. Powell, \n128 \nU.S. 691, 697\n, 698 S., 32 L. ed. 566, 568, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 203; Tubbs v. Wilhoit, \n138 \nU.S. 134, 143\n, 144 S., 34 L. ed. 887, 890, 891, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 279; Knight v. United Land Asso. \n142 \nU.S. 161, 177\n, 182 S., 35 L. ed. 974, 979, 981, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 258; Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, \n168 \nU.S. 589, 594\n, 42 S. L. ed. 591, 593, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 208. This was a continuing authority which was not suspended by the school grant to the state. The subsequent adoption of rules relating to surveys did not alter the terms of the grant, but these rules did control the administrative action, which, in view of the terms of the grant, was necessary to make the grant effective. By order of April 17, 1879, the Commissioner required that surveyors general should not 'file the duplicate plats in the local land offices until the duplicates have been examined in this office and approved,' and the surveyors general 'officially notified to that effect.' Re F. A. Hyde & Co. 37 Land Dec. 165. It cannot be doubted that this requirement was within the authority of the Commissioner (see Tubbs v. Wilhoit, \n138 \nU.S. 134, 143\n, 144 S., 34 L. ed. 887, 890, 891, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 279); and it necessarily follows that the making of the field survey and its approval \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 211]\n\u00a0\n by the surveyor general of Oregon did not make the survey complete as an official act. It still remained subject to the examination and approval of the Commissioner, and for that purpose copies of the plat of survey and field notes were transmitted to the Commissioner, who, not being satisfied, required a supplemental report. The matter was still in abeyance when the lands in controversy were withdrawn for forestry purposes by the Secretary of the Interior on December 16, 1905. Reference is made to the terms of the territorial act of 1848 (supra) with respect to the reservation of the described sections when the lands were 'surveyed . . . preparatory to bringing the same into market,' but this provision furnishes no ground for the contention that an incomplete and unapproved survey was intended. Much less can it be said that, under the grant of the enabling act of 1859, the title would pass at any intermediate stage of the survey. Nor is there merit in the contention that is based on  2275 of the Revised Statutes as amended by the act of February 28, 1891 (supra), protecting settlements when made 'before the survey of the lands in the field.' That act imposes no limitation upon the authority of Congress to dispose of the lands before title passes to the state; and if title passes upon survey, it must be upon a survey duly completed according to the authorized regulations of the Department. It is said, however, that in this case the plat was officially used by the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the Secretary of the Interior in connection with the withdrawal under consideration, and hence that the survey must be deemed to have been officially approved. Wright v. Roseberry, \n121 \nU.S. 488, 517\n, 30 S. L. ed. 1039, 1047, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 985; Tubbs v. Wilhoit, supra. It is true that the lands withdrawn were conveniently described according to townships, and that the official correspondence referred to an accompanying diagram showing the townships and sections. But neither the \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 212]\n\u00a0\n correspondence nor the diagram contained any reference to a survey of the lands in question or constituted an approval of a survey. These lands still remain to be officially defined in the appropriate manner, and according to the agreed statement the survey was accepted by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, as stated, on January 31, 1906, and was filed in the local land office on November 16, 1907, entries during the interval having been suspended pending certain investigations. We think that it is immaterial that the survey was finally approved by the Commissioner without modification, for pending the approval it remained in his hands, officially incomplete, awaiting the result of his examination. Again, it is urged that the survey, when approved, related back to the date of the grant, or at least to the date of the survey in the field. The former contention is but a restatement in another form of the argument that Congress could not dispose of the land pending the survey, which, as we have seen, is answered by the terms of the grant; and if Congress had this power of disposition, it must mean that the lands could be disposed of under the authority of Congress at any time before the survey became a completed administrative act. The doctrine of relation cannot be invoked to destroy this authority.\n In establishing and enlarging the Cascade Range Forest Reserve, the President acted under the express authority conferred by the acts of March 3, 1891, chap. 561,  24 (26 Stat. at L. 1095, 1103, Comp. Stat. 1913,  5116, 5121), and June 4, 1897, chap. 2 (30 Stat. at L. 11, 36). The power to establish the permanent reservation included the power to make temporary withdrawals (United States v. Midwest Oil Co. \n236 \nU.S. 459, 476\n, 59 S. L. ed. 673, 682, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 309); and the order of the Secretary of the Interior, made on December 16, 1905, must be regarded as the act of the President. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 10 L. ed. 264. The disposition by the President, under the authority of Congress, was a disposition by Congress. \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 213]\n\u00a0\n It is finally contended that the proclamation by the President on January 25, 1907 [34 Stat. at L. 3270], expressly excepted the lands in question. The exception was 'of all lands which at this date are embraced within any withdrawal or reservation for any use or purpose to which this reservation for forest uses is inconsistent.' The evident purpose of the proclamation was to confirm and make permanent the prior withdrawal for forestry purposes, not to override it. The very object of that withdrawal was to prevent claims of title from thereafter attaching to the lands. And the reference in the exception to 'any withdrawal or reservation,' as we view it, was to withdrawals or reservations by the government itself for other and inconsistent uses, and was with a view of avoiding confusion in governmental action, not to let in subsequently accruing claims of title under school grants as to which Congress had indicated its purpose to make compensation for deficiencies when lands which otherwise would have passed to the state thereunder had been duly taken for reservations. The contention that the lands were not 'public lands' until surveyed, and hence were not subject to reservation by the President under the act of Congress, is plainly without basis. See Rev. Stat.  453, Comp. Stat. 1913 ,  699. The provision for forest reservations refers to any part of the public lands which were subject to the disposition of Congress. It is also argued that the state, under the act of February 28, 1891 (supra), has the right to await the 'extinguishment' of the 'reservation,' and the 'restoration of the lands therein embraced to the public domain,' and then to take the described sections. We are not called upon to consider any such question here, and we express no opinion upon it, as there has been no extinguishment of the reservation, and from any point of view it must be concluded that no title had passed to the state when it made the conveyance under which the appellees claim. \n\n[240 U.S. 192, 214]\n\u00a0\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the of the District Court is affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ohio (2 Stat. at L. 175, chap. 40); Louisiana (2 Stat. at L. 394, chap. 39, 5 Stat. at L. 600, chap. 33); Indiana (3 Stat. at L. 290, chap. 57); Mississippi (2 Stat. at L. 234, chap. 27, 10 Stat. at L. 6, chap. 35); Illinois (3 Stat. at L. 430, chap. 67); Alabama (3 Stat. at L. 491, chap. 47); Missouri (3 Stat. at L. 547, chap. 22, Comp.

Stat. ( Comp. Stat. 1913,  4530), but never perfected it. Being the owner of other lands in the same neighborhood, Freeland agreed with one Rayford to give him a turpentine lease for a lump sum upon all of his timber, not including the homestead. A third party having been employed to reduce the agreement to writing, Freeland discovered that the homestead had been included, and he called Rayford's attention to this and tendered back the \n\n[240 U.S. 284, 286]\n\u00a0\n check given for the consideration money, on the ground that if the homestead was included in the lease he would be in danger of losing his entry. Rayford replied: 'There is no law against turpentining a piece of homestead land as long as you are on it.' And so Freeland made no further objection.\n Rayford, during the years in question, conducted turpentining operations upon the Freeland homestead and a large number of other tracts in its vicinity. Under date December 21, 1903, he had entered into a 'shipping contract' with the Union Naval Stores Company, by which he undertook to cut and box at least 10 crops of 10,500 boxes each from lands described in a deed of trust or mortgage of even date given by him to one Wade as trustee of the company, and to manufacture the crude turpentine into spirits of turpentine and rosin, and deliver the manufactured product at Mobile, Alabama, or other points selected by it. By the same agreement plaintiff in error undertook to advance moneys to be used by Rayford, and that it would receive the manufactured turpentine and rosin and sell it for Rayford's account at stipulated charges and commissions. The mortgage was given to secure the advances and the performance of the shipping agreement. It covered Rayford's turpentine leases, and also all crude and manufactured spirits of turpentine, and other products owned or in any manner secured by Rayford during the continuance of the contract. The crude turpentine taken by Rayford from the homestead was mixed with that taken from his other properties at or before it reached the still; and the manufactured products were shipped from time to time to plaintiff in error at Mobile, bills of lading being sent by mail, and accounts of sales being returned by plaintiff in error to Rayford.\n It was admitted that, during the years 1904 and 1905, spirits of turpentine and rosin were received by plaintiff in error from Rayford, under the contract and mortgage referred \n\n[240 U.S. 284, 287]\n\u00a0\n to, in quantities greater than those claimed for in the suit. There was evidence as to the market values of these products during the period in question, but none as to the market value of crude turpentine. A verdict and judgment having gone in favor of the United States for $2,447.55, defendant appealed to the circuit court of appeals, where it was directed that so much of this as represented interest prior to the commencement of the action should be remitted, and the judgment otherwise affirmed. 123 C. C. A. 1, 202 Fed. 491.\n There are numerous assignments of error, based upon exceptions taken at the trial, one of them to the refusal to direct a verdict in favor of defendant, the others to instructions given or refused to be given. Without reciting these in detail, we will express our views upon the principal questions of law that are raised.\n Neither the complaint nor the evidence is fatally defective or uncertain. The claim is for spirits of turpentine and rosin taken from certain described lands. That it was the crude, and not the manufactured, product that was in a literal sense taken from the land, is of no consequence. The land is referred to only to identify the chattels, conversion of which is alleged. Whether there was an error in the particular description of the lands, as is insisted, is a matter of no serious consequence, for they were otherwise described as the 'Louis I. Freeland Homestead,' and there was uncontradicted evidence that the lands referred to, and no others, were known by this description. That the evidence did not show precisely what quantities of turpentine spirits and rosin, manufactured from the crude turpentine taken from the homestead, were received by the plaintiff in error, was not ground for a peremptory instruction to find for defendant, or to limit the recovery to nominal damages, since there was evidence from which the jury could form a reasonably certain estimate of the amount of crude taken from the homestead during the \n\n[240 U.S. 284, 288]\n\u00a0\n years in question, and the amount of spirits and rosin that this probably yielded.\n There was no error in charging that 'the boxing of trees by a settler on public land covered by an unperfected homestead entry, or by any person who knew it was public land (which an unperfected homestead entry is), and the extracting of crude turpentine therefrom, constitutes in law an intentional, wilful trespass, although he may have acted without knowledge of the illegality of the act, and that from such persons the United States are entitled to recover the value of the product manufactured from such crude turpentine by the settler, or from any person into whose possession the same may have passed.' This refers, of course, as other parts of the charge clearly show, to a manufacture by Rayford, who was himself the trespasser.\n The rights and privileges of an entryman with reference to standing timber were considered and discussed in Shiver v. United States, \n159 \nU.S. 491, 497\n, 498 S., 40 L. ed. 231-233, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 54, where, after reviewing the pertinent sections of the Revised Statutes, it was said: 'From this resume of the homestead act, it is evident, first, that the land entered continues to be the property of the United States for five years following the entry, and until a patent is issued; . . . third, that meantime such settler has the right to treat the land as his own so far, and so far only, as is necessary to carry out the purposes of the act. The object of this legislation is to preserve the right of the actual settler, but not to open the door to manifest abuses of such right. Obviously the privilege of residing on the land for five years would be ineffectual if he had not also the right to build himself a house, outbuildings, and fences, and to clear the land for cultivation. . . . It is equally clear that he is bound to act in good faith to the government, and that he has no right to pervert the law to dishonest purposes, or to make use of the land for profit or speculation. The law \n\n[240 U.S. 284, 289]\n\u00a0\n contemplates the possibility of his abandoning it, but he may not in the meantime ruin its value to others, who may wish to purchase or enter it. With respect to the standing timber, his privileges are analogous to those of a tenant for life or years. . . . By analogy we think the settler upon a homestead may cut such timber as is necessary to clear the land for cultivation, or to build him a house, outbuildings, and fences, and, perhaps, as indicated in the charge of the court below, to exchange such timber for lumber to be devoted to the same purposes; but not to sell the same for money, except so far as the timber may have been cut for the purpose of cultivation.'\n There is nothing in the letter or policy of the homestead act that permits the boxing and chipping of pine trees for the purpose of extracting turpentine for sale and profit. It cannot be regarded as cultivation within the meaning of the act; it affects the value of the inheritance too seriously for that. As is well known, the process requires the cutting of a deep gash or 'box' into the side of the tree, so shaped as to catch and retain a considerable quantity of the crude gum, and repeated chippings thereafter, by each of which an additional portion of the bark is cut through to the wood so as to expose a fresh bleeding surface. It not only saps the vital strength of the tree and lessens its power to resist the force of the wind, but exposes the wood to decay and to wood-boring grubs and beetles; while the waste gum, being highly inflammable, increases the danger of forest fires. Government publications have repeatedly pointed out the ill effects of the practice. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The recognition of these evils led Congress to pass the \n\n[240 U.S. 284, 290]\n\u00a0\n act of June 4, 1906, chap. 2571, 34 Stat. at L. 208, now found in Crim. Code,  51 (act of March 4, 1909, chap. 321, 35 Stat. at L. 1088, 1098, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10,165, 10,218). It is true that in Bryant v. United States (1901) 45 C. C. A. 145, 105 Fed. 941, the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit, in holding that boxing for turpentine was not a criminal offense within the meaning of  2461, Rev. Stat. (Comp. Stat. 1913,  4980), said, obiter, 'We think it is not a matter of common knowledge that such cutting and boxing of pine trees destroy the value of the trees as timber, or that it has a tendency even to retard the growth of the trees,' and that this view was made the basis of a decision by the circuit court of appeals from the eighth circuit that, prior to the act of 1906, the boxing of trees for turpentine on public lands was not actionable. United States v. Waters Pierce Oil Co. 116 C. C. A. 391, 196 Fed. 767, 769. We are clear, however, that the act of 1906 only rendered criminal that which before was actionable because not included in any right or privilege expressly or by implication conferred upon the homesteader by the act of Congress. So the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit held in Parish v. United States, 106 C. C. A. 570, 184 Fed. 590. And see United States v. Taylor, 35 Fed. 484.\n Rayford, in conducting his turpentining operations upon the homestead with notice that the land was the property of the United States, became a wilful trespasser, although he may have supposed, as he is said to have declared, that there was 'no law against it.' He acted with full notice of the facts, and his mistake of law cannot excuse him.\n Upon the facts as the jury must have found them, the distillation by Rayford of the gum that was taken from the government's land was a continuing act of trespass that did not devest the United States of its property, but left it still entitled to the manufactured products. Distilled Spirits (Harrington v. United States) 11 Wall. 356, 369, 20 L. ed. 167, 171. If the doctrine of confusion of goods were to be applied, the entire product of the still would belong to the United States. The \n\n[240 U.S. 284, 291]\n\u00a0\n Idaho, \n93 \nU.S. 575, 586\n, 23 S. L. ed. 978, 982. But, by the instructions of the trial judge, recovery was limited to the value of the products manufactured from crude gum taken from the Freeland homestead.\n It is ingeniously argued that a different rule must govern as between the United States and the defendant company, because the company had a mortgage upon Rayford's product, both crude and manufactured; that the crude stuff as soon as it reached the still was inextricably mixed with a much greater quantity to which Rayford had an unquestioned title, which passed to defendant at once by virtue of the mortgage, and that the evidence shows such hopeless confusion and admixtures of unknown quantities and varying qualities of gum that no reasonable ascertainment of the rights of the parties as tenants in common is possible; therefore, the government property, being relatively small in value, passed to defendant under the doctrine of accession. It is less confidently argued that the same result would apply even as between the lawful owner and a wilful trespasser; but this we deem clearly untenable. One who knowingly takes the property of another cannot, by changing its form or increasing its value, or by commingling it with other property of his own, acquire title by accession. Distilled Spirits, supra; Silsbury v. McCoon, 3 N. Y. 379, 53 Am. Dec. 307, 315, note.\n The argument based upon the mortgage is confronted with this obstacle, to say nothing of others: that the mortgage and the shipping contract alike contemplated that Rayford should manufacture the crude turpentine into spirits and rosin and ship these to defendant, and such was the actual course of dealing thereunder. Defendant at no time asserted any lien upon or property in the crude material by virtue of the mortgage. And even if it were now permitted by a fiction to assert ownership in all that part of the crude gum which was the lawful property \n\n[240 U.S. 284, 292]\n\u00a0\n of Rayford, as of the time that it reached his still, it must perforce place itself in the position of employing Rayford as its agent for the purpose of distilling the turpentine. New Rayford, in doing this, placed with it a comparatively small, but still substantial, quantity of crude turpentine that was the property of the United States. Defendant cannot take a benefit from the distilling operations thus conducted by Rayford without at the same time assuming a responsibility for that which he did; and what he did in distilling the government's gum was a continuing trespass, that left the United States entitled to its property in its changed form, the same if the distilling was done by Rayford under an agency from defendant, as if done on his individual account.\n And, of course, if defendant's title dates from the time of the delivery to it of the manufactured product, it can take no greater interest than that which Rayford held.\n Thus, whether we indulge the fiction, or whether we adhere to the practical fact, which is that Rayford under the contract delivered manufactured products to defendant, the latter can take no credit for the work and labor bestowed upon the turpentine by the wrongdoer, but must answer for its value as manufactured products. E. E. Bolles Wooden-Ware Co. v. United States, \n106 \nU.S. 432, 435\n, 27 S. L. ed. 230, 231, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398; Guffey v. Smith, \n237 \nU.S. 101, 119\n, 59 S. L. ed. 856, 866, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 526.\n The after-acquired-property clause in the mortgage does not help matters for defendant. Property in the turpentine could not be acquired by Rayford without the consent of the United States, and this he did not have. See Holt v. Henley, \n232 \nU.S. 637, 640\n, 58 S. L. ed. 767, 772, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 459; Detroit Steel Cooperage Co. v. Sistersville Brewing Co. \n233 U.S. 712\n, 58 L. ed. 1166, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 753.\n It is insisted that if a tenancy in common existed in the manufactured product, the possession of it by defendant company was not tortious, and that in order to show a conversion there must be either a demand for possession and refusal thereof, or a showing that some \n\n[240 U.S. 284, 293]\n\u00a0\n disposition was made of the chattels inconsistent with and destructive of the rights of plaintiff as cotenant. But, taking the shipping contract and the mortgage with the testimony and admissions as to the course of business carried on thereunder, the jury was fully warranted in finding that defendant had converted the manufactured products by selling them soon after they were received, and accounting to Rayford for the proceeds. The question of conversion was submitted to the jury, with a proper instruction that in such event a demand for possession was futile and therefore unnecessary.\n The trial court instructed the jury that recovery should be based upon the market value of the spirits and rosin at the time they were received by defendant, and it is insisted that the value at the time of the conversion ought to have been taken instead. As to this it is sufficient to say that, except as it was to be inferred that probably the manufactured products were sold not long after their receipt by defendant, there is nothing to throw light upon the time that intervened between receipt and sale; and while by stipulation the highest and lowest market prices for turpentine and for rosin during the years 1904 and 1905 were shown, it did not appear at what time the prices were high, and at what time low. In short, the evidence contained nothing to aid the jury in distinguishing between the market price at the time of receipt and the market price at the time of sale. Defendant did nothing-if it could-to elucidate the matter by evidence, nor did its exceptions call the attention of the trial judge to the point now insisted upon.\n Minor points are raised, but none that seems to call for discussion.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'A New Method of Turpentine Orcharding,' Bulletin No. 40, Bureau of Forestry, 1903, pp. 9-13; 'The Naval Stores Industry,' Bulletin No. 229, Department of Agriculture, July 28, 1915; 'Conservative Turpentining,' Senate Doc. 676, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., vol. 11, p. 498.

Stat. 1913,  8820). The relief asked, moreover, in the nature of things embraced certain subsidiary agreements made during the course of the execution of the main contract, in furtherance of its alleged prohibited result. The principal agreement was made in 1908, to last until February 28, 1911, but was to continue in force thereafter from year to year unless not later than December 1st of each year a notice of the intention not to continue was given. On December 3, 1910, however, just a month before this suit was filed, the agreement in question was renewed for a period of five years.\n We give from the argument on behalf of the United States a statement of the corporate defendants to the bill, some of whom had become parties to the alleged illegal combination by subsidiary agreement or agreements made at a later date than the original contract.\n\n 1. \n'The Allan Line Steamship Company, Limited, hereafter called the 'Allan Line,' a British corporation, operating from Portland, Boston, and Philadelphia to London, Liverpool, and Glasgow and return. \n\n[239 U.S. 466, 469]\n\u00a0\n 2.

We extract from the argument on behalf of the government the following statement of the main provisions of the principal agreement.\n'(1) The parties guarantee to each other certain definite percentages of the entire steerage traffic carried by them both eastbound and westbound between European ports and the United States and Canada, except Mediterranean passengers.\n\n'(2) Any line exceeding its allotment must pay into the pool a compensation price of 4 for each excess passenger, which sum is to be paid proportionately to the line or lines \n\n[239 U.S. 466, 471]\n\u00a0\n which have not carried their full quota. It is expressly stated that this provision 'forms one of the main features of the entire contract.'\n\n'(3) Each line must make a weekly report of the number of steerage passengers carried, and from these the secretary of the pool compiles weekly statements showing the pool position of each line. He also prepares each month provisional accounts of the compensation due from lines which have exceeded their quota. This must be paid immediately on paid of heavy penalties. Final settlements are made at the end of each year.\n\n'(4) Each line undertakes to arrange its rates and service in such manner that the number of steerage passengers it actually carries shall correspond as nearly as possible with the number allotted to it by the contract. If any line exceeds its proportion it is in duty bound to adopt measures calculated to bring about a correct adjustment. The other lines may either await the action of the individual line, or a majority of the lines representing 75 per cent of the pool shares can immediately order rates on a plus line to be raised or rates on a minus line to be lowered, and from this order there is no appeal. It is expressly stated, however, that 'all parties were unanimously of the opinion that the adjustment is, whenever practicable, to be effected not by reducing the rates of one line, but, on the contrary, by raising the rates of one or several of the lines.\n\n'(5) No line has the right to alter its steerage rates without having previously informed the secretary; i. e., all lines are bound to maintain existing rates until the other pool members are notified.\n\n'(6) No circulars or publications shall be issued by any line reflecting upon or instituting comparisons with any other conference line unfavorable to the latter, and no party shall support (advertise in) any newspaper which shall systematically attack any conference line.\n\n'(7) To insure the faithful performance of the agree- \n\n[239 U.S. 466, 472]\n\u00a0\n ment, each line deposits with the secretary a promissory note in the amount of 1,000 for each per cent of traffic allotted to it in the pool. From this amount penalties may be collected ranging from 250 for smaller infractions to the forfeiture of the entire deposit if the line withdraws from the agreement before its expiration, refuses to pay compensation money, or assists directly or indirectly any opposition line.\n\n'(8) New lines may be admitted or the terms of the agreement altered only by unanimous vote, unless otherwise provided in the contract.\n\n'(9) To assist in the carrying out of the agreement a secretary was appointed.\n\n'(10) Regular meetings are to be held alternately at London and Cologne for the purpose of carrying out this agreement and agreements collateral thereto. These meetings constitute what is called the Atlantic Conference.\n\n'Representatives of the Atlantic Conference Lines likewise meet in New York in what is called the American Atlantic Conference or New York Conference.'\n\n It is to be observed in addition that the agreement expressly provided that the withdrawal of any one of the lines from the contract should release all others from all future obligation unless the others agreed among themselves to continue.\n To the elucidation of the view we take of the case it suffices to say that, as the result of the answers of the defendants, the issues which arose for decision were two-fold in character: Did the anti-trust act relate to the business of ocean transportation with which the assailed agreement and those subsidiary to it were concerned; and if so, did the agreements and the conduct of the defendants under them constitute a violation of the provisions of the anti-trust act?\n The court below, although deciding that the ocean \n\n[239 U.S. 466, 473]\n\u00a0\n transportation covered by the main agreement was under the control of the anti-trust act, yet held that the assailed contract and the action of the parties under it were not within the terms of the act, and therefore that the complaint of the government on that subject was without foundation. The court, however, concluded that a certain subsidiary agreement which had been entered into in the process of the execution of the original agreement had given rise to a practice which was reprobated by the anti- trust act, and the further execution of such agreement and the carrying out of the practice under it were by the decree forbidden. The court reached these conclusions upon opinions formed concerning the nature and character of ocean transportation with which the agreement was concerned, the evils which had existed in the traffic and which it was the purpose of the agreement to remedy, the practice of the commercial world in dealing with such transportation in the past, the benefit which had resulted to commerce from the execution of the agreement, the reflex light thrown upon its intent and object by the reasonable rates which had been applied in its execution, and many other conditions which had come to pass as a result of the agreement, tending to the amelioration of the conditions of steerage travel and the resulting benefaction to the safety, comfort, and health of the millions of human beings traveling by steerage, to which class of traffic alone the contract related. 216 Fed. 971.\n The contentions which presumably were urged in the court below and which it is deemed by the parties here arise for decision will at once appear by giving a brief statement concerning those made on this appeal by the United States and by the defendants as appellees or an a cross appeal. On behalf of the United States it is insisted that the provisions of the anti-trust act agreement constitute a plain violation of agreement constitute a plain violation of that act, that the conduct of the parties under \n\n[239 U.S. 466, 474]\n\u00a0\n it adds additional force to the considerations arising from the text of the contract, since it demonstrates that the purpose of the agreement was to destroy competition, to acquire dominion over rates and to fix them as the result of monopoly, and that it is wholly irrelevant to inquire whether, in executing the wrongful powers which were acquired by the contract, the parties were beneficent in their action, since what the act forbids is the monopoly and the combination for the purpose of obtaining monopoly, and there is no distinction in the act between a good monopoly and a bad one. On the other hand, the contentions of the defendants are as follows: First, that, conceding the power, it is not to be assumed, in the absence of express declaration to that effect, that the purpose of Congress in the anti-trust act was to extend its authority into foreign countries to prevent the execution in such countries of contracts which were there legal and and which were intended, in view of the conditions there prevailing, to better enable the discharge by ocean carriers of their duty. Second, that it appears from subsequent legislation of Congress that it was not its intention to deal with ocean transportation from and to foreign countries by the anti-trust act, since such transportation was dealt with in subsequent legislation in a manner which persuasively leads to such conclusion. Chap. 349,  73-77, 28 Stat. at L. 570, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8831-8835; chap. 11,  34, 30 Stat. at L. 213; Joint Resolution, 38 Stat. at L. 779. Third, that in fully investigating and considering the question whether ocean transportation to and from foreign countries was included in the anti-trust act, in an elaborate report a committee of the House of Representatives had expressed conclusions in conflict with the view that the act did apply, and had recommended the adoption of legislation to guard against evils in such traffic, if any, and which legislation, if adopted, would be in a large sense incompati- \n\n[239 U.S. 466, 475]\n\u00a0\n ble with the conclusion that the anti-trust act was applicable to such transportation.\n While this mere outline shows the questions which are at issue and which would require to be considered if we had the right to decide the controversy, it at once further demonstrates that we may not, without disregarding our duty, pass upon them because of their absolute want of present actuality; that is, because of their now moot character as an inevitable legal consequence springing from the European War which is now flagrant,-a matter of which we take judicial notice. Montgomery v. United States, 15 Wall. 395, 21 L. ed. 97; United States v. Lapene, 17 Wall. 601, 21 L. ed. 693, 7 Moore, Int. Law Dig. 244, 250. The legal proposition is not in substance controverted, but it is urged, in view of the character of the questions and the possibility or probability that, on the cessation of war, the parties will resume or recreate their asserted illegal combination, we should now decide the controversies in order that by operation of the rule to be established any attempt at renewal of or creation of the combination in the future will be rendered impossible. But this merely upon a prophecy as to future conditions invokes the exercise of judicial power not to decide an existing controversy, but to establish a rule for controlling predicted future conduct, contrary to the elementary principle which was thus stated in California v. San Pablo & T. R. Co. \n149 \nU.S. 308, 314\n, 37 S. L. ed. 747, 748, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 876:\n'The duty of this court, as of every judicial tribunal, is limited to determining rights of persons or of property which are actually controverted in the particular case before it. When, in determining such rights, it becomes necessary to give an opinion upon a question of law, that opinion may have weight as a precedent for future decisions.

Prince Line, 220 Fed. 230, where, although it was recognized that 'the combination against which this proceeding is directed, composed of two British and two German steamship companies, has been practically dissolved as a result of the European War,' and the questions presented 'have become largely academic,' the court nevertheless proceeded to consider and dispose of the case on the merits, observing in conclusion, however: 'In view of the fact that the logic of events has turned this investigation into an autopsy, instead of a determination of live issues, it seems unnecessary to discuss the persuasiveness of the proofs,' etc. But we cannot give our implied sanction to what was thus done or accept the persuasiveness of the reasoning upon which the action was based, in view of the settled decisions of this court to the contrary, and the fundamental principles of public policy upon which they are based. In fact, at this term, although we were pressed to take jurisdiction of a cause in a capital case after the death penalty had been inflicted on the accused, we declined to do so and dismissed for want of jurisdiction because the case had become a moot one.

In the first, the Trans-Missouri Case, a combination between railroads, charged to be illegal, was by consent dissolved, and it was held that, in view of the continued operation of the railroads and the relations between them, their mere consent did not relieve of the duty to pass upon the pending charge of illegality under the statute of their previous conduct, since by the mere volition of the parties the combination could come into existence at any moment. Leaving aside some immaterial differences, in terms the ruling in the Southern Pacific Case was based upon the decision in the Trans-Missouri Case. Here, on the contrary, the business in which the parties to the combination were engaged has, by force of events beyond their control, ceased, and by the same power and a continued relation concerning it between them has become unlawful and impossible. The difference between this and the Trans- Missouri Case was clearly laid down in Mills v. Green, \n159 U.S. 651\n, 40 L. ed. 293, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132, where, after announcing the general rule as to the absence of authority to consider a mere moot question, and referring to possible exceptions resulting from the fact that the want of actuality had arisen either from the consent of the parties or the action of a defendant, it was declared: 'But if the intervening event is owing to the plaintiff's own act or to a power beyond the control of either party, the court will stay its hand.'\n Although it thus follows that there are no issues on the merits before us which we have a right to decide, it yet remains to be determined what our order should be with reference to the decree below rendered, which, as we have seen, was against the government and in favor of the assailed combination because it was found not to be within the prohibitions of the anti-trust act. As established by the ruling in South Spring Hill Gold Min. Co. v. Amador Medean Gold Min. Co. \n145 U.S. 300\n, 36 L. ed. 712, 12 Sup. Ct.

Coming to consider the question in that light, and in view of the nature and character of the conditions which have caused the case to become moot, we are of opinion that the ends of justice exact that the judgment below should not be permitted to stand when, without any fault of the government, there is no power to review it upon the merits, but that it should be reversed and the case be remanded to the court below with directions to dismiss the bill without prejudice to the right of the government in the future to assail any actual contract or combination deemed to offend against the anti-trust act.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","221":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUTERHART v.

Frey for appellants.\n Assistant Attorney General Wallace and Mr. William C. Herron for appellee.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 598, 601]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a suit to recover succession taxes paid by appellants under the act of June 13, 1898 (chap. 448, 30 Stat. at L. 448, 464, Comp. Stat. 1913,  6144), on account of interests in personal property passing to the residuary legatees under the will of Conrad Stein, deceased. It was brought under the act of June 27, 1902 (chap. 1160,  3, 32 Stat. at L. 406), which provides for refunding 'so much of said tax as may have been collected on contingent beneficial interests which shall not have become vested prior to July first, nineteen hundred and two.' The testator was domiciled in the state of New York, and the will was probated and appellants were appointed executors and trustees in that jurisdiction. The residuary legatees were seven of the nine children of testator, and at the time of his death on April 6, 1900, several of them were minors. All of the seven were living on July 1, 1902. The youngest, Carl Stein, had not attained the age of twentyone years on that date. The residuary estate amounted to more than $1,000,000, and the taxes collected with respect to it aggregated $17,130.82, being based upon the theory that each of these legatees took a vested seventh interest at the death of the testator. If the taxes had been assessed on the advances actually made by appellants as executors and trustees for the benefit of the residuary legatees prior to July 1, 1902, they would have amounted to only $745.12.\n One of the clauses of the will contained words bequeathing the residuary estate outright to the seven children in equal shares; but this was qualified by inconsistent language in other clauses, and some time prior to January 16, \n\n[240 U.S. 598, 602]\n\u00a0\n 1902, one of the executors brought suit in the supreme court of the state of New York against his coexecutors and the beneficiaries for a judicial construction of the will, and a decree was made on the date mentioned, of which the pertinent clauses are set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[240 U.S. 598, 603]\n\u00a0\n Testator's personalty passed under the will, and the executors and trustees proceeded under and complied strictly with the directions contained in it, as interpreted and construed by the decree.\n The court of claims held (49 Ct. Cl. 709) that the interest bequeathed by the will to the residuary legatees was a vested estate, and not a contingent beneficial interest, citing Vanderbilt v. Eidman, \n196 U.S. 480\n, 49 L. ed. 563, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 331, and United States v. Fidelity Trust Co. \n222 U.S. 158\n, 56 L. ed. 137, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 59.\n It is very properly admitted by the government that the New York decree is in this proceeding binding with respect to the meaning and effect of the will. The right to succeed to the property of the decedent depends upon and is regulated by state law (Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 57\n, 44 S. L. ed. 969, 976, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747), and it is obvious that a judicial construction of the will by a state court of competent jurisdiction determines not only legally but practically the extent and character of the interests taken by the legatees.\n It is, however, contended that the will, as thus construed, either gave the residuary estate absolutely to the children by name, share and share alike, postponing payment \n\n[240 U.S. 598, 604]\n\u00a0\n merely until Carl died or reached majority, or that it gave the estate to them absolutely when Carl died or attained majority, meanwhile giving to each child the income of his or her proportionate share. With this view we cannot concur. The decree declares the true construction to be 'that the whole of his residuary estate, real and personal, should, so far as necessary, be applied to the support and education of his minor children, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella Stein, and Carl Stein, during the minorities if Carl Stein survive such period.' Then follows a clause to the effect that the trustees should apply the income to the support and education of the minor children until they respectively attain the age of twenty-one years, if Carl survive such period, and that on his attaining the age of twenty-one or sooner dying the testator gave, devised, and bequeathed the residue to the seven named (including Carl) in equal shares. A subsequent clause directs the executors and trustees 'to apply so much of the rents of the real estate, and of the income of the personal estate as shall be reasonable and proper, to the support and education of the testator's said minor children during their respective minorities as aforesaid.' They are empowered, during the minority of the minor children, 'to pay over by way of advance' to the seven, 'in equal amounts or shares, so much of the capital of the testator's residuary personal estate, or the income thereof, as in their judgment they may deem reasonable so to pay over.' And, finally, 'the said executors and executrix and trustees shall not be compelled to make distribution of the principal of the estate or any part thereof, except in the exercise of their reasonable discretion, until the said Carl Stein attains the age of twenty-one years.'\n It will be observed not only that the trust continued until the youngest child reached the age of twenty-one, but that no one of the seven was entitled in the meantime to receive anything of either principal or income except \n\n[240 U.S. 598, 605]\n\u00a0\n on the affirmative exercise of a discretion conferred upon the executors and trustees.\n This having been authoritatively decided to be the true effect and meaning of the will, we are of opinion that the interests to which the residuary legatees succeeded were contingent, and not vested prior to July 1, 1902, within the meaning of the refunding act as construed in previous decisions of this court upon the subject (Vanderbilt v. Eidman, \n196 \nU.S. 480, 500\n, 49 S. L. ed. 563, 570, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 331; United States v. Jones, \n236 \nU.S. 106, 111\n, 59 S. L. ed. 488, 490, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261; McCoach v. Pratt, \n236 U.S. 562\n, 59 L. ed. 720, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 421), except with respect to such amounts as were actually paid out of the trust fund by the trustees prior to that date, in the exercise of their discretion; the proper tax upon which, according to the findings, would have been $745.12.\n The judgment will be reversed, and the cause remanded, with direction to enter judgment in favor of appellants for the tax collected in excess of that amount upon the interests of the residuary legatees.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed: That it was the intention of the said Conrad Stein, and such is the true meaning and construction of his will, that the whole of his residuary estate, real and personal, should, so far as necessary, be applied to the support and education of his minor children, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella Stein and Carl Stein during the minorities if Carl Stein survive such period. To that end he gave, devised, and bequeathed to Emil Heuel and Alexander Stein, his executors and trustees, and to Josephine Stein, his executrix and trustee, all his residuary estate, both real and personal, upon trust to receive the rents, issues, and profits and income thereof until his son Carl Stein attains the age of twenty-one years, and to apply the same to the support and education of the testator's said minor children, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella Stein, and Carl Stein, until they respectively attain the age of twenty-one years, if Carl Stein survive such period, and on Carl Stein attaining the age of twenty-one years, or sooner dying, the said testator gave, devised, and bequeathed the said residuary estate, both real and personal, to his children Charlotte Truebenbach, Wilhelmina Schneider, Elizabeth Heuel, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella Stein, and Carl Stein in equal shares and parts.\n'The said executors and executrix and trustees are empowered by the said will to let and lease the said residuary real estate and to make such repairs and improvements upon said residuary real estate as in their judgment may be necessary.

Williams, and Owen Pickens for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Bert Winters, Burt New, Wilbur T. Gruber, and Mr. Evan B. Stotsenburg, Attorney General of Indiana, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Railroad Commission of Indiana was created and broad powers were conferred upon it by an act approved February 28, 1905, and an amendatory act approved March 9, 1907 (Acts 1905, p. 83; Acts 1907, p. 454; Burns's \n\n[242 U.S. 255, 257]\n\u00a0\n Anno. Stat. [Ind.] 1908,  5531 et seq.). By a later act (Acts 1909, p. 323), the Commission was specifically authorized and directed to investigate the condition and efficiency of headlights then in use on locomotive engines on the railroads in the state, determine the most practicable and efficient headlight for all purposes, and make and enforce against the railroad companies the necessary orders for the installation of such headlights. Pursuant to this authority it conducted an investigation, upon notice to plaintiff in error and all other steam railroad companies operating in the state, the result of which was an order, made January 6, 1910, reciting the investigation, declaring that the oil headlights commonly in use were inadequate for the protection of persons and property, and ordering that all engines used in the transportation of trains over any line of railroad in the state should be equipped 'with headlights of not less than 1,500 candle power.' About one month thereafter plaintiff in error brought an action in a state court of competent jurisdiction seeking to enjoin enforcement of the order upon the ground that the act of 1909 and the order made pursuant to it were repugnant to the 'commerce clause' of the Constitution of the United States and the statutes enacted thereunder, and to the 'due process clause' of the 14th Amendment. Among other grounds of attack it was averred that the order was so vague, indefinite, and uncertain in its description of the headlight required as to be meaningless and void, because it failed to specify at what distance from the source of light the illuminating power was to be measured, and whether it was to be determined by averaging the intensity of the light at a given distance from its source, and if so, at what distance; that the order did not specify the character of the reflector, nor whether the required candle power might be developed by reflectors or lenses, or whether the light must be of 1,500 candle power independent of such lenses or re- \n\n[242 U.S. 255, 258]\n\u00a0\n flectors; it being averred that each of these elements was an essential factor in the ascertainment and measurement of the illuminating capacity of headlights, and that there was no known standard by which such capacity might be measured and expressed in terms of candle power in the absence of those factors. From an amended complaint, and from the Commission's answer thereto, it was made to appear that, after the making of the order, Mr. Houghton, chairman of a committee appointed to represent the plaintiff and the other railroad companies named in the order with respect to presenting a petition to the Commission for a modification of its provisions, made written application to the Commission for a suspension of the order and a further hearing upon the subject; that the Commission replied that, under the statute and the practice of the Commission, it had authority to alter, change, or modify any final order made by it, and that the Commission would not suspend the order in question, but would treat Mr. Houghton's communication as an application for its modification, and specifying a time for the hearing of that application; that on the date specified the carriers appeared by Mr. Houghton, chairman of the committee, and by counsel, and withdrew the application for modification, whereupon it was dismissed. Plaintiff demurred to the answer, the demurrer was overruled, and, plaintiff refusing to plead further, final judgment was rendered against it, and, on appeal, this was affirmed by the supreme court of Indiana; that court holding that plaintiff's complaint did not show ground for the relief sought. 182 Ind. 382, 101 N. E. 85. The case comes here upon the Federal questions, under  237, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1214].\n So far as the attack upon the Act of 1909 and the order made pursuant to it is based upon interference with interstate commerce, it very properly is conceded that, but for a recent act of Congress, the case would be controlled by Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Georgia, \n234 \nU.S. 280, 290\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1312, 1317, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 829, \n\n[242 U.S. 255, 259]\n\u00a0\n where it was held that, in the absence of Federal legislation, the states are at liberty, in the exercise of their police power, to establish regulations for securing safety in the physical operation of railroad trains within their territory, even though such trains are used in interstate commerce; and that (p. 293) the Safety Appliance Acts of Congress, since they provided no regulations for locomotive headlights, showed no intent to supersede the exercise of state power with respect to this subject.\n But it is insisted that this decision is no longer controlling, because Congress has since then 'exercised its power as to equipment over the entire locomotive and tender and all parts and appurtenances thereof.' The reference is to the act of March 4, 1915 (chap. 169, 38 Stat. at L. 1192), amendatory of the act of February 17, 1911, requiring common carriers engaged in interstate commerce to equip their locomotives with safe and suitable boilers and appurtenances thereto (chap. 103, 36 Stat. at L. 913, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8630). The latter act was among those referred to in the Georgia Case, and held not to oust the authority of the state because it did not appear either that Congress had acted, or that the Interstate Commerce Commission, under the authority of Congress, had established any regulations concerning headlights. The amendment of 1915 extends the provisions respecting inspection, etc., to the entire locomotive and all its appurtenances. Whether those provisions authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to prescribe any particular type of headlight, or other appliance, is a question upon which we need not now pass, for the reason that the decision of the supreme court of Indiana, refusing an injunction to restrain the enforcement of the state Commission's order, was rendered and judgment thereon entered before the passage by Congress of the act referred to. Obviously, we cannot say that by that decision and judgment any right of plaintiff in error under a law of the United States was infringed, within the mean- \n\n[242 U.S. 255, 260]\n\u00a0\n ing of  237, Judicial Code, when the law creating the supposed right was not enacted until after the judgment. If, however, by virtue of the provisions of the Act of 1915, or of any action heretofore or hereafter taken by the Interstate Commerce Commission under it, plaintiff in error is entitled to an injunction against the further enforcement of the order of the state Commission, that right may be asserted in another action and will not be prejudiced by our present decision.\n With respect to the question of due process of law, it is unnecessary to determine whether the 14th Amendment requires that state action, legislative in its nature, of the character of the order of the Railroad Commission, shall be preceded by notice and an opportunity for a hearing. In the case before us, the supreme court of Indiana construed the act of 1909 as supplemental to the act of 1905, which, as amended in 1907 (Acts 1907, p. 469,  6; Burns's Anno. Stat. [Ind.] 1908,  5536), gave to any carrier or other party dissatisfied with any order made by the Commission a right to resort to the courts in an action to suspend it or set it aside. Since the order in question was made after notice and a full hearing, and plaintiff in error had and exercised the right to a judicial review by action at law, we concur in the view of the state court that there has been in this respect no deprivation of property without due process of law.\n The only other point requiring mention is the insistence that the order is so indefinite and uncertain in its terms as not to furnish an intelligible measure of the duty of plaintiff in error, and is therefore a denial of due process of law. Upon this point the state court held, following its previous decision in Chicago, I. & L. R. Co. v. Railroad Commission, 175 Ind. 630, 638, 95 N. E. 364, that the Railroad Commission itself, by virtue of the act, had power to grant relief through a rehearing, and that without first resorting to that method of procedure plaintiff in error was not entitled to have the \n\n[242 U.S. 255, 261]\n\u00a0\n order set aside by the courts. The general rule is that one aggrieved by the rulings of such an administrative tribunal may not complain that the Constitution of the United States has been violated if he has not availed himself of the remedies prescribed by the state law for a rectification of such rulings.

Appellees claim under mortgages upon certain real estate in Wichita, alleged to have been recorded before building operations on the property were commenced. Appellants maintain construction began prior to recordation, and that they are secured by preferred mechanics' liens created by the Kansas statute. Disagreeing with the district court, but in accord with the referee's opinion, the circuit court of appeals (132 C. C. A. 631, 216 Fed. 721) held that no 'such work as amounted to the commencement of the building within the meaning of the Kansas statute' was performed prior to the time when the mortgages were placed on record, and 'that what was done was but a mere pretense at the commencement of a building, done to defeat bona fide prior liens.' And it accordingly adjudged the mortgage creditors entitled to priority.\n The essential question presented is one of fact; and there is sharp dispute in the testimony. Substantial difficulties are disclosed, but, after considering the evidence, we think it sustains the conclusions reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals; and the judgment entered there is accordingly affirmed. \n\n\n\n","224":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWHITE v.

Stat. 1913,  2838, it was enacted that 'all officers of the Navy who, since the third day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, have been advanced or may hereafter be advanced in grade or rank pursuant to law shall be allowed the pay and allowances of the higher \n\n[239 U.S. 608, 612]\n\u00a0\n grade or rank from the dates stated in their commissions.' The claims are made under this act for the difference between the pay and allowances received during active service after retirement and that of the higher grade to which the claimants respectively had been advanced. Demurrers to the petitions were sustained by the court of claims.\n The claimants, although pressing the universal application of the statute according to the literal meaning of its words, still tacitly concede that we must go behind the letter of the law. For while the statute says that all officers who have been advanced since the date mentioned shall have the pay of the higher grade, and says nothing about active service, the claims are confined to the periods of active service named, which implies a concession that the advance in grade by itself was not enough. And this concession was required by the fact that the statute grants allowances as well as pay, and that allowances are an incident of active duty alone.\n As it stands admitted that the statute is of more limited scope than is apparent on its face, to an untrained reader, at least, the question is whether it is to be read as applying to all advanced officers who have been on active service, or only to all such officers upon the active list. We are of opinion that the latter is the true meaning, and that the decision of the court of claims was right. The general rule of the statutes is found in Rev. Stat.  1462, Comp. Stat. 1913,  2652. 'No officer on the retired list of the Navy shall be employed on active duty except in time of war.' An exception, limited to twelve years from its passage, was made by the act of June 7, 1900, allowing officers on the retired list, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Navy, to be ordered to such duty as they might be able to perform, and giving them while so employed the pay and allowances of the grade on the active list from which they were retired. When the act of 1913, under which these claims are made, \n\n[239 U.S. 608, 613]\n\u00a0\n was passed, this exception had expired,-all services under it had been rendered and paid for, and, with other exceptions not affecting this case, the general rule was in force. It is more rational to suppose that Congress was dealing with present affairs than that it was reopening transactions that might be ten years old, and that must have been finished, at the latest, nearly a year before. And this construction is confirmed when we notice that the increased pay and allowances are given from the date of the commission; that is, if the claimants are right, from the date of their retirement, without regard to the time when their active duty began. In these cases it was continuous with their service before retirement. But it might have begun years afterwards, and yet, by the statute, the date of the increase in pay and the allowances would have been the same.\n The conclusion to which the statutes directly concerned would lead us is confirmed still further by consideration of the act of August 22, 1912, chap. 335, 37 Stat. at L. 328, 329. This act provided that thereafter any naval officer on the retired list might, with his consent, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Navy, be ordered to such duties as he might be able to perform, and while so employed in time of peace should receive the pay and allowances of an officer on the active list of the same rank, provided that he was not to receive more than the pay and allowances of a lieutenant, senior grade, on the active list of like length of service, and, if his retired pay exceeded that, then he was to receive his retired pay only. The clash that there would be between the policy of this act and that of 1913, if construed as the claimants would have it construed, is plain.\n Finally, it may be worth noticing that the reports that introduced the enactment pointed out as the evil to be remedied that, under the act of June 22, 1874, chap. 392, 18 Stat. at L. 191, Comp. Stat. 1913,  2837, the only officers who did not receive the pay of \n\n[239 U.S. 608, 614]\n\u00a0\n their grade from the time they took rank as stated in their commissions were the youngest officers, who were appointed to the lowest grade, and therefore not promoted to fill a vacancy, as contemplated in the act of 1874.

U S(1916)\nNo. 309\nArgued: April 19, 1916Decided: May 1, 1916\n\n\n\n Appellant is the receiver of the firm of Cowardin, Bradley, Clay, & Company, and the successor of one John D. McClennan. The latter filed in the court of claims a petition, subsequently amended by appellant, praying a judgment against the United States for the sum of $43,510, the amount due that company on a contract for labor and materials furnished for the construction of a filtration plant in the District of Columbia.\n The court found, among other things, that there is a driveway running completely about the reservoir, which is an irregularly shaped body of water, comprising the western and southern part of the filtration plant. The starting point of 'the roadway' (so-called by the court), its course and termination, are stated.\n The set of plans attached to the written contract, and by its terms made a part of the agreement, included certain plans showing the roadway bordering the reservoir west of the filter beds. One of the plans (sheet 2) was a draw- \n\n[241 U.S. 149, 150]\n\u00a0\n ing showing the work in general sections; another plan (sheet 4) was a general plan and showed finished surfaces; and general plan No. 1 showed the entire projected plant. All of these plans indicated a roadway, and sheet No. 16 also indicated a roadway.\n Afterwards two supplemental plans, relating to the roadway and giving details as to grades, were furnished the contractor.\n Appellant's predecessor, McClennan, began work on the roadway in January or February, 1904. It does not appear that the contractor was ordered in terms by the government engineers to build the roadway, but it is shown that when he commenced work on it the engineers gave him the line of the toe of the slope, and from time to tiem furnished him with the lines showing the direction of the road and the stakes showing the grade, and that the work was done under their inspection as to the lines, slopes, and the character of the material allowed to be deposited thereon.\n The contractor began to build the roadway by filling with earth excavated from other parts of the work, and he continued to fill in and build the roadway in accordance with the plans and under the inspection of the engineers until February 14, 1905, and had been paid at various times about $12,000 on account of the work done on estimates made by the government. The first payment was on voucher, month of March, 1904, covering all work done on the road up to the end of February, 1904, for 'embankment (A, item No. 2), 13,000 cubic yards, at 30 cents, less 10 per cent retained, amounting to $3,510.' Except for said voucher no separate estimates were made of the amount of fill placed in the roadway, the work done thereon being included in the regular monthly estimates with the work done on other portions of the filtration plant.\n Shortly after McClennan was appointed receiver in \n\n[241 U.S. 149, 151]\n\u00a0\n August, 1903, he made arrangements with the Soldiers' Home authorities, at a considerable cost, to dispose of waste material on the Soldiers' Home grounds under certain conditions, the terms of which, so far as the amount of material to be placed thereon is concerned, were never carried out. The roadway was just as convenient a place as any to dispose of waste material, and the cost of putting it there was no more than it would have been to have placed it on the Soldiers' Home grounds.\n McClennan, he then being receiver, was informed by the engineer officer in charge on behalf of the United States that he would not allow any further payments for work done on the roadway. For a short time afterward, and pending negotiations regarding the matter with the engineer officer, appellant continued dumping material that he wanted to dispose of on the roadway. He finally discontinued work thereon, on, at which time about 6,000 cubic yards of fill was necessary to complete the roadway. It was subsequently finished by the United States without further cost.\n In the final settlement there was deducted from the amount paid a sum equal to such of the fill in the roadway as had been paid for at the rate of 30 cents per cubic yard, amounting to about $12,000.\n'On or about February 15, 1904, the government engineer in charge had cross sections taken over the line of the roadway in question, which cross sections were used in computing the amount of work done by the contractor thereon outside of the lines allowed and paid for in the final estimate, and the amount of fill so made and not paid for was found to be 67,578 cubic yards, which, at 30 cents per cubic yard, amounts to $20,273.40.'\n\n From these facts the court concluded that appellant was not entitled to recover, and dismissed the petition. Judgment was entered accordingly and this appeal was then prosecuted. \n\n[241 U.S. 149, 152]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Chauncey Hackett for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the facts as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n It appears from the findings that the plans showed a roadway bordering the reservoir. This finding seems to be contested by the government, the contention being that where the roadway was to be placed 'was merely marked,' and no detail whatsoever as to its exact location or dimensions was shown by the plans. The finding, however, is more specific. One of the plans showed the work in general sections and indicated the roadway; another showed finished surfaces, with the roadway thereon; still another showed the entire filtration plant, the road again being indicated, and it was marked again on another plan. Such persistent repetition must have had other purpose than mere designation, and, besides, there were supplemental plans furnished the contractor relating to the roadway, giving detail as to grades. And, further, the engineer in charge gave the 'toe of the slope' to the contractor and 'from time to time furnished him with the lines showing the direction of the road and the stakes showing the grade.' 'The lines, slopes, and the character of the material allowed to be deposited thereon' were under his inspection.\n The force of these findings is added to by the fact that the engineer first in charge and under whom the work was commenced on the roadway drew the plans and his action was their interpretation. It was not inadvertent. The first payment to the contractor was on a voucher which contained the work on the road as an item of liability, and, though subsequent vouchers omitted such \n\n[241 U.S. 149, 153]\n\u00a0\n specification, work on the roadway was included in the regular monthly estimates. And this continued until a new engineer came upon the scene. With him came controversy. He not only introduced a new construction of the contract, but so far reversed the construction and action of his predecessor as to deduct in the final settlements the amounts allowed by the latter.\n Undoubtedly the contract has ambiguity, and to present and resolve the ambiguity in detail would require a precise and literal examination of the contract. Such examination would greatly and, we think, uselessly, prolong this opinion. We should be brought, nevertheless, to a few broad determining considerations.\n The contention of the government is based upon what is said to be the purpose of the contract, which, it is further said, 'so far as appellant was concerned [italics counsel's], was the construction of the filtration plant proper.' The appellant, in opposition, declares that the contract enumerated three kinds of fills 'and all other fills and embankments shown by the plans or directed to be made by the engineer officer in charge.' Though some doubts beset appellant's contention and some considerations bear against it, there are others which determine for it. The most important of the considerations against it is the charge by the government that the contractor was paid for every yard of excavation, and that the dirt excavated had to be deposited somewhere, and the roadway 'was just as convenient a place as any to dispose' of it. And this is given strength by the fact that the contractor had arranged, at a considerable cost, with the Soldiers' Home authorities to dispose of waste material on the grounds of the Soldiers' Home.\n But there is the countervailing consideration to which we have adverted, that is, of the action of the engineer first in charge, and it was he who drew the contract. He was there for direction. He considered that the roadway \n\n[241 U.S. 149, 154]\n\u00a0\n WAS PART OF THE SCHEME. HE DIRECTED AND superintended its constructIon. and it was a systematic structure, not a mere dumping place or deposit for material. It was constructed upon lines, slopes, and grades, and of selected materials. Further, in continued manifestation of his judgment that the contract included it, and in approval of its conformity to the contract, he directed payment for it. There is nothing which reflects upon the sincerity of his judgment, and it is necessarily the important factor in determining the responsibility of the government.\n Whether the roadway was necessary or accessory to the filtration plant is not important to consider. We may observe, however, that it was subsequently finished by the United States, and manifestly deemed desirable.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to enter judgment for appellant on the findings and in accordance with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","226":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLIAMS v. COBB(1916)\nNo. 125\nArgued: Decided: December 18, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[242 U.S. 307, 308]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John B. Sanborn and Chauncey E. Blake for appellant.\n Mr. Kurnee R. Babbitt for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Clarke delivered the opinion of the court:\n In 1904 Laura A. Cobb died testate at Mineral Point, Wisconsin, and by her will directed her executors to invest the sum of $2,000 of her estate in 'interest-bearing securities,' to pay the income thereof to Catherine Monohan during her life, and on her death to distribute the trust fund to certain persons designated in the will. The defendant, John P. Cobb, and one Calvert Spensley, were appointed executors of Mrs. Cobb's will, and so administered her estate that in July, 1908, they filed their final account as executors, reciting that the estate was wholly distributed, with the exception of twenty shares of the capital stock of the First National Bank of Mineral Point, which the account stated the executors had caused to be transferred to themselves and registered in their names as trustees for Catherine Monohan.\n The bank became insolvent, and the Comptroller of the Currency on the 3d day of November, 1909, made an assessment of $100 upon each share of the capital stock of the bank for the payment of creditors.\n The defendant was a son of the deceased, and, as legatee and distributee, received a sum of money greater than the amount of the assessment on the twenty bank shares.\n The foregoing facts are all derived from the bill filed in \n\n[242 U.S. 307, 309]\n\u00a0\n this case, to which the defendant demurred. The district court sustained the demurrer and entered an order dismissing the bill. The circuit court of appeals affirmed this decree, and the case is here upon appeal.\n The theory upon which this suit was commenced is that the transfer of the twenty shares of bank stock by Cobb and Spensley, as executors, to themselves, as trustees for Catherine Monohan, is void; that the stock is as if it had never been transferred at all, and is therefore an undistributed asset of the estate of Mrs. Cobb, and that the defendant, having received as legatee and distributee much more than the amount of the assessment, is liable under the Wisconsin statute to the receiver for the assessment, a debt of the estate, all the other assets having been distributed before the failure of the bank.\n Obviously the question as to the liability of the defendant turns upon whether the transfer of the stock to Cobb and Spensley, as trustees for Catherine Monohan, is void or voidable; for if it is voidable only, this suit was improvidently commenced. At common law, and no Wisconsin statute is cited to modify the rule, an executor has full power, without any special provision of the will that he is administering or order of court, to sell or dispose of the personal assets of the estate, and thereby to pass good title to them. Munteith v. Rahn, 14 Wis. 210; Ex parte Gay, 5 Mass. 419; Leitch v. Wells, 48 N. Y. 585. Perry, Tr.  225, 809. A sale by an executor, even to himself, is not void, but only voidable, at the option of interested persons. Grim's Appeal, 105 Pa. 375; Tate v. Dalton, 41 N. C. (6 Ired. L.) 562. And if, after such purchase from himself, an executor sells to another, the purchaser from him acquires a good title. Cannon v. Jenkins, 16 N. C. (1 Dev. Eq.) 426.\n No suggestion is made that the transfer of the stock by the executors to themselves as trustees was not made in good faith, and it was obviously made under the conviction \n\n[242 U.S. 307, 310]\n\u00a0\n that it was, if not 'an interest-bearing security,' at least the equivalent of such a security. Very certainly this was the basis for the approval of the transaction by the appropriate Wisconsin court more than a year before the bank failed, and, for anything that appears in the record, prior to the time when the bank became insolvent.\n The claim that the lower court failed to give proper effect to  2091 of the Wisconsin statute cannot be allowed. The part of this section which is claimed to be applicable reads:\n'When a trust shall be expressed in the instrument creating the estate, every sale, conveyance or other act of the trustee in contravention of the trust shall be absolutely void.'\n\n This section is found in a chapter devoted to 'Uses and Trusts,' of the title, 'Real Property and the Nature and Quality of Estates Therein,' and the claim is made that its drastic provision should be extended to trusts in personal property. No Wisconsin court has so applied it, but, on the contrary, the supreme court of the state, in Lamberton v. Pereles, 87 Wis. 449, 23 L.R.A. 824, 58 N. W. 776, refused to make other sections of this same chapter respecting real estate applicable to personal property, saying: 'In this state we have no statute making the statute of uses and trusts, or any part of it, applicable to personal property.' It is significant also that, in the statute dealing with 'Trust Investments,' no such provision is found. Wis. Stat. Supp.  2100b.\n It results that, since the executors had lawful authority to dispose of the bank shares, assets as they were of the estate, so long as the transfer is permitted to stand unassailed directly the title to them is in the defendant and Spensley, as trustees for Catherine Monohan, and that the estate of Mrs. Cobb is not liable to the receiver for the assessment claimed. if the estate is not liable, the \n\n[242 U.S. 307, 311]\n\u00a0\n defendant, as legatee and distributee, is not liable, and the claim in suit, obviously without natural equity, is therefore without technical merit, and the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","227":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLINK v. U S(1916)\nNo. 180\nArgued: January 21, 1916Decided: April 3, 1916\n\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 572, 573]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George A. King and William B. King, for appellant.\n\n\n\n[240 U.S. 572, 575]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson for the United States.\n\n\n[240 U.S. 572, 577]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n Henry F. Willink sued to recover as upon an implied contract for an alleged taking of his property in the improvement of the harbor in the Savannah river at Savannah, Georgia. A recovery was denied (38 Ct. Cl. 693; 49 Ct. Cl. 701), and the claimant's executrix prosecutes this appeal.\n The material facts disclosed by the findings are these: At Savannah the river is navigable and within the ebb and flow of the tide. Opposite the city is Hutchinson's island, a strip of which on the side towards the city was owned by the claimant. He there conducted a plant for repairing vessels. Among his facilities used in the business were a marine railway and a wharf. The former extended into the river and was protected by sheet piling 'where in the water.' A substantial portion of it lay below the mean high-water line, and the wharf seems also to have been below that line, although its location is not precisely stated. In the conduct of the claimant's business the vessels subjected to repair were drawn out of the river and lowered into it by means of the railway, and to prevent its lower end, 'which was under water at high tide,' from becoming seriously obstructed by deposits of mud the piling was driven on both sides. The piling was effectual for the purpose, but decayed in time and had to be replaced.\n Prior to 1887 many improvements had been made in the harbor, and in that year a plan for further and extensive improvements was submitted to Congress, but was not approved. Among other changes this plan contemplated \n\n[240 U.S. 572, 578]\n\u00a0\n a widening of the river by cutting away a portion of Hutchinson's island, including that whereon the claimant's facilities were situate. On May 4, 1889, the harbor line, which theretofore had not reached the island or the claimant's facilities, was re-established by the Secretary of War, under  12 of the act of August 11, 1888, chap. 860, 25 Stat. at L. 400, 425, in such manner that a part of the claimant's land and all of his facilities were brought within the harbor area. In 1890 another extended project, retaining the earlier proposal to widen the river by cutting away a portion of the island, was submitted to Congress and was approved. The estimated cost of this project was $3,500,000, which included $45,000 for 'possible land damages' to the island. A part of the larger sum was appropriated each year until the appropriations equaled the full estimate, which was in 1895. The appropriation of July 13, 1892, chap. 158, 27 Stat. at L. 88, 92, was accompanied by a provision that 'contracts may be entered into by the Secretary of War for such materials and work as may be necessary to complete the present project of improvement, to be paid for as appropriations may from time to time be made by law, not to exceed in the aggregate' so much of the estimate as remained unappropriated. A contract was then made for cutting away a portion of the island, including that whereon the claimant's facilities were situate, but this work never was done or undertaken, and the appropriations were otherwise exhausted and the project treated as completed.\n In the summer of 1892 the condition of the claimant's wharf and piling became such that it was necessary to rebuild the one and to renew the other. While he was so engaged the engineer officer in charge of the harbor improvements requested him to desist and to remove all of his facilities that were within the harbor area as defined by the Secretary of War in 1889. The request was followed by a letter from the United States attorney for \n\n[240 U.S. 572, 579]\n\u00a0\n that district, notifying the claimant that in driving the piling he was obstructing navigation contrary to the act of September 19, 1890, chap. 907, 26 Stat. at L. 426, 454, 455, and that unless he desisted and 'all piling outside of the bulkhead line' was removed, he would be prosecuted. Because of this request and notice he ceased work upon the piling and wharf, but did not remove any of his facilities or surrender them or his land to the United States or any of its officers. On the contrary, he continued to operate his plant and use his marine railway and other facilities as best he could. Theretofore he was able to haul up on the railway and repair vessels of considerable draft, and the chief profit in his business came from that work; but thereafter, the renewal of the piling being prevented, deposits of mud filled up the entrance to the railway to such an extent that he was obliged to confine his work to smaller vessels. Even then it was necessary to be almost constantly dredging the entrance. This condition continued until December, 1897, when the Secretary of War re-established the harbor line as it was prior to May 4, 1889. The expense incurred by the claimant in dredging was $7,697, and the loss consequent upon his inability to handle the larger vessels was $ 12,500.\n Upon these facts, as before indicated, the court held that he was not entitled to recover.\n We reach the same conclusion, and for the following reasons:\n There was no actual taking of any of the claimant's property, nor any invasion or occupation of any of his land. As respects his upland, he was not in any wise excluded from its use, nor was his possession disturbed. Something more than the location of a harbor line across the land was required to take it from him and appropriate it to public use. Yesler v. Washington Harbor Line, \n146 \nU.S. 646, 656\n, 36 S. L. ed. 1119, 1122, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190; Prosser v. Northern P. R. Co. \n152 \nU.S. 59, 65\n, 38 S. L. ed. 352, 356, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 528; Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, 223 U.

And the contract for cutting away a part of the land was also without effect, because there was no attempt at performance. Thus, at best, the asserted taking rested upon the acts of the engineer officer and the district attorney in preventing the claimant from renewing his piling and rebuilding his wharf. But in this no right of his was infringed. The river being navigable and tidal, whatever rights he possessed in the land below the mean high-water line were subordinate to the public right of navigation and to the power of Congress to employ all appropriate means to keep the river open and its navigation unobstructed.

The piling and wharf were below the mean high-water line, and so, if navigation was likely to be injuriously affected by their presence, Congress could prevent their renewal without entitling him to compensation therefor. See cases supra. By the legislation in force at the time, Congress not only authorized the Secretary of War to establish the harbor lines, but made it unlawful to extend any wharf or other works, or to make any deposits, within the harbor area as so defined, except under such regulations as the Secretary might prescribe, and laid upon the district attorney and the officer in charge of the harbor improvements the duty of giving attention to the enforcement of its prohibitive and punitive provisions (chap. 860,  12, 25 Stat. at L. 400, 425; chap. 907,  11, 12, 26 Stat. at L. 426, 455, Comp. Stat. 1913,  9923). When the claimant attempted to renew the piling and rebuild the wharf, they were not only below the mean high-water line, but \n\n[240 U.S. 572, 581]\n\u00a0\n within the harbor area as defined under this legislation. Consistently with its prohibitions he could not proceed with the work, except under a permissible regulation of the Secretary of War. It is not contended that the work was thus made permissible, and so the conclusion is unavoidable that the claimant was proceeding in violation of the statute, and that the engineer officer and the district attorney rightly requested him to desist. Such inconvenience and damage as he sustained resulted not from a taking of his property, but from the lawful exercise of a power to which it had always been subject. Gibson v.
