 June 10, 1913
 Messrs. Thomas P. Bradfield and Jacob Kleinhans for appellant.
 Mr. Roger I. Wykes and Mr. Grant Fellows, Attorney General of Michigan, for appellee.

 Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:
 Appellant is a telephone company, located at the city of Jackson, state of Michigan, doing an extensive business. It brought this bill in equity to restrain the collection of a tax levied under the laws considered in No. 284. [
229 U.S. 322
, 57 L. ed. --, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 833.] It is substantially like the bill in the latter case.
 A demurrer was filed to the bill, and, being overruled, an answer was filed. After hearing, a decree was entered dismissing the bill. This appeal was then taken.
 The questions presented are the same as those presented in No. 284, and were submitted at the same time and on the same argument. On the authority of the opinion in that case the decree is affirmed.[ Citizens' Tel Co of Jackson v. Fuller
