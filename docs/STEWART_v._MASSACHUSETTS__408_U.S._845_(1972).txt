Opinion


United States Supreme Court
STEWART v. MASSACHUSETTS(1972)
No. 71-5446
Argued: Decided: June 29, 1972




 Imposition and carrying out of death penalty in this case held to constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Furman v. Georgia, ante, p. 238.

 ___ Mass. ___, 270 N. E. 2d 811, vacated and remanded.



PER CURIAM.


The appellant in this case was sentenced to death. The imposition and carrying out of that death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Furman v. Georgia, ante, p. 238. The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The judgment is therefore vacated insofar as it leaves undisturbed the death penalty imposed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
