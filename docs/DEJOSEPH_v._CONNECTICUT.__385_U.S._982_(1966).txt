Docket: 759
Opinion


United States Supreme Court
DEJOSEPH v. CONNECTICUT.(1966)
No. 759
Argued: Decided: June 16, 1966


  Arbo was set free. The petitioner, convicted of the same offense in the same State, remains in jail. When the meaning of a fundamental constitutional right depends on which court in Connecticut a person turns to for redress, I believe it is time for this Court to intervene. I would grant certiorari and set this case for argument.
