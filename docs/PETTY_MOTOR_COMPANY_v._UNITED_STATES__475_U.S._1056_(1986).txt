Opinion


United States Supreme Court
PETTY MOTOR COMPANY v. UNITED STATES(1986)
No. 85-798
Argued: Decided: March 3, 1986


  On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.
  The petition for writ of certiorari is denied.

 Justice WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.
  In this case the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that as a matter of federal law a United States Marshal's conducting a judicial foreclosure sale constitutes "seizing

 or levying" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1921.* As the Government concedes, this decision conflicts with the decisions of three Courts of Appeals that have held that costs could not be taxed under  1921 in cases involving judicial foreclosure sales. See Travelers Insurance Co. v. Lawrence, 509 F.2d 83 (CA9 1974); James T. Barnes & Co. v. United States, 593 F.2d 352 (CA8 1979); Federal Land Bank of St. Paul v. Hassler, 595 F. 2d 356 (CA6 1979). I would grant certiorari to resolve this conflict.
