Opinion


United States Supreme Court
SHINE v. FOX BROS MFG CO(1910)

Argued: Decided: March 7, 1910


 Messrs. Shepard Barclay, Thomas T. Fauntleroy, and Cornelius H. Fauntleroy for appellants.
 Messrs. Herbert R. Marlatt and Frank H. Sullivan for appellee.

 Per Curiam: In the circumstances disclosed by this record, we are of opinion that a direct appeal does not lie to this court from the decree of the circuit court, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.[ Shine v. Fox Bros Mfg Co
