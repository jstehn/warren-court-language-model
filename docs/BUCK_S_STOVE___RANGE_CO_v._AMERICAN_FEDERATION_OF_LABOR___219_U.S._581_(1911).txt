Opinion


United States Supreme Court
BUCK'S STOVE & RANGE CO. v. AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR(1911)
No. 190
Argued: Decided: February 20, 1911


 Messrs. Daniel Davenport and J. J. Darlington for Buck's Stove & Range Company.
 Messrs. Alton B. Parker, Jackson H. Ralston, F. L. Siddons, and W. E. Richardson for American Federation of Labor et al.

 Per Curiam:
 When these cases were reached for hearing, and after the argument had materially progressed, it developed from statements made by counsel for both parties that the cases had become purely moot because of the settlement between the parties of every material controversy which the record presented. On the disclosure of this situation, further argument was dispensed with; and for the reason which led to that action, that is, as we have said, that the controversies between the parties had become in all respects moot, the appeals must be dismissed.
