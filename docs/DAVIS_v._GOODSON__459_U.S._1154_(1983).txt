Opinion


United States Supreme Court
DAVIS v. GOODSON(1983)
No. 82-490
Argued: Decided: January 17, 1983


  On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arkansas.
  The petition for writ of certiorari is denied.

 Justice STEVENS, concurring in the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari.
  Because the petition for a writ of certiorari does not affirmatively show that a federal question was presented to or decided by the Supreme Court of Arkansas, I believe the Court correctly denies the writ.

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting.
  Petitioner was summarily held in contempt for advising his client that he had a privilege not to submit to a breathalyzer test. In citing petitioner for contempt, the judge made no finding that the advice was given in bad faith. Given the absence of such a finding, I would grant certiorari to decide whether petitioner's conviction and sentence for contempt
