No. 70-5376

 157 Mont. 99, 483 P.2d 720, reversed.



PER CURIAM.


The motion of the appellant for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.

Whether a welfare program is or is not federally funded is irrelevant to the constitutional principles enunciated in Shapiro v. Thompson, 
394 
U.S. 618
. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana is reversed.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE is of the opinion that probable jurisdiction should be noted and the case set for oral argument.
