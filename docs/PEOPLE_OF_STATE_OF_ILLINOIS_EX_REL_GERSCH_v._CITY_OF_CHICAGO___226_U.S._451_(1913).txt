Opinion


United States Supreme Court
PEOPLE OF STATE OF ILLINOIS EX REL GERSCH v. CITY OF CHICAGO(1913)
No. 474
Argued: Decided: January 6, 1913



 Messrs. William H. Sexton and John W. Beckwith for plaintiff in error.
 Messrs. Allen B. Chilcoat and Stephen A. Day for defendants in error.

 Memorandum opinion, by direction of the court, by Mr. Chief Justice White:
 This is a companion case to Preston v. Chicago, No. 195, just disposed of [
226 U.S. 447
, 57 L. ed. --, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 177]. Unlike the record in the Preston Case, however, the record in this case does not contain the final judgment to which the writ of error is directed. As we cannot assume that a judgment was in fact entered in the supreme court of Illinois, it results that we are without authority to exert jurisdiction.
 Writ of error dismissed.[ People of State of Illinois ex rel Gersch v. City of Chicago 
226 U.S. 451
