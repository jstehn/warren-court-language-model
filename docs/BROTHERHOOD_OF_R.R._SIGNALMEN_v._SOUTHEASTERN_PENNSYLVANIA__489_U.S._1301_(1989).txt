BROTHERHOOD OF R.R. SIGNALMEN v. SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA(1989)
No. A-715
Argued: Decided: March 14, 1989


  On application to vacate injunction.

 Justice BRENNAN, Circuit Justice.
  Applicants request me, as Circuit Justice, to enter an order " immediately dissolving" the injunction issued by the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. I deny the application. In my view, applicants have not "established that there is a 'reasonable probability' that four Justices will consider the issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari." Rostker v. Goldberg,
