Opinion


United States Supreme Court
JAMES FRAZIER  v.  OHIO(2008)
No. 07-9052
Argued: Decided: April 21, 2008



     The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.

     Statement of Justice Stevens respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari.


     While I agree with the Court's decision to deny certiorari in this case, it is appropriate to emphasize, as I have in the past, see, e.g., Knight v. Florida, 528 U. S. 990 (1999) (opinion respecting denial of certiorari); Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U. S. 940, 942 (1978) (same), that the denial of certiorari expresses no opinion on the merits of the underlying claim.
