Opinion


United States Supreme Court
BUCKLIN v. U. S.(1895)
No. 246
Argued: Decided: November 18, 1895


 Asst. Atty. Gen. Dickinson, for appellee.

 Mr. Justice HARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.
 The appellant, Bucklin, was convicted of the crime of perjury, under section 5392 of the Revised Statutes, and sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor in the penitentiary for the term of 1 1/2 years, and also to pay a fine of $100. He seeks a review of that judgment by the present appeal.
 The appeal must be dismissed. By section 5 of the act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 826, c. 517), 'appeals or writs of error may be taken from the district courts or from the existing circuit courts' of the United States directly to this court, in certain enumerated cases, civil and criminal; among others, 'in cases of conviction of a capital or otherwise infamous crime.' There was no purpose by that act to abolish the general distinction, at common law, between an appeal and a writ of error. The final judgment of a court of the United States in a case of the conviction of a capital or otherwise infamous crime is not reviewable here except upon writ of error. Our review of the judgment, when brought here in that form, is confined to questions of law, properly presented by a bill of exceptions, or arising upon the record.
 Appeal dismissed.
