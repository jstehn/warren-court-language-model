Description: MARCUS DANTE REED  v.  LOUISIANA
Date: 2017-02-27 00:00:00
Docket: 16-656
Opinion


United States Supreme Court
MARCUS DANTE REED  v.  LOUISIANA(2017)
No. 16-656
Argued: Decided: February 27, 2017



     The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
     Justice Breyer, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.
     Marcus Dante Reed was sentenced to death in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, a county that in recent history has apparently sentenced more people to death per capita than any other county in the United States.  See Aviv, Revenge Killing: Race and the Death Penalty in a Louisiana Parish, The New Yorker, July 6 & 13, 2015, p. 34.  The arbitrary role that geography plays in the imposition of the death penalty, along with the other serious problems I have previously described, has led me to conclude that the Court should consider the basic question of the death penalty's constitutionality.  See Glossip v. Gross, 576 U. S. ___ (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  For this reason, I would grant Reed's petition for a writ of certiorari.
