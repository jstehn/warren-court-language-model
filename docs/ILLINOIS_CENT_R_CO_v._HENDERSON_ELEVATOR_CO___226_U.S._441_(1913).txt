 Memorandum opinion, by direction of the court, by Mr. Chief Justice white:

W. 779), this writ of error was sued out.
 It is to us clear that the action of the court below in affirming the judgment of the trial court, and the reasons upon which that action was based, were in conflict with the rulings of this court, interpreting and applying the act to regulate commerce.
