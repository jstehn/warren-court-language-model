Opinion


United States Supreme Court
ROBERT MEGGINSON  v.  UNITED STATES(2009)
No. 07-6309
Argued: Decided: May 18, 2009



     The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted.  The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for further consideration in light of Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___ (2009).

     Justice Alito, dissenting.
     In Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), the Court held that a law enforcement officer who arrests a vehicle occupant may search the vehicle if the officer has reason to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the crime of arrest. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 18).  The Court took this test from Justice Scalia's separate opinion in Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 632 (2004) (opinion concurring in judgment), but did not provide an independent explanation of the basis for or the scope of this rule.  As I observed in dissent, Gant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10), this test creates a host of uncertainties, and this case illustrates just one of the problems.


     Here, petitioner, a vehicle occupant, was arrested on a warrant for threatening to kill his wife in violation of N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §14-277.1 (Lexis 2007).**  It does not appear that petitioner told his wife how he intended to kill her, i.e., with a gun, knife, bare hands, etc.  After petitioner was arrested, his car was searched, and the officer found, among other things, a loaded revolver and drugs.  This case thus appears to present an important question regarding the meaning and specificity of the reasonable suspicion requirement in Gant.  Because of the ambiguity of the new Gant test and the frequency of roadside arrests, I would grant certiorari in this case to provide much needed clarification.
