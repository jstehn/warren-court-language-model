Docket: 75-817
Opinion


United States Supreme Court
NEBRASKA PRESS ASSOCIATION v. STUART(1975)
No. 75-817
Argued: Decided: December 12, 1975


  Motion of Nebraska Press Association et al. for leave to treat their application as a petition for writ of certiorari having been heretofore granted, it is ordered:

  1. 
Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Nebraska granted;

  2. 
Motion to expedite denied. Mr. Justice BRENNAN, Mr. Justice STEWART, and Mr. Justice MARSHALL would grant motion.

  3. 
Application for stay denied. Mr. Justice BRENNAN, Mr. Justice STEWART, and Mr. Justice MARSHALL would grant application. Mr. Justice WHITE would stay judgment of the Nebraska Supreme Court to the extent that its order forbade the publication of information disclosed in public at the preliminary hearing in the criminal case out of which this case arose. In this respect, he is in disagreement with the Court's actions in this case today. He joins the Court in granting the petition for writ of certiorari and in ordering plenary consideration of this case, which as he understands it raises issues broader than the power of the State to enjoin the publication of facts disclosed at a public hearing in a State court. Being convinced that these questions should be decided only after adequate briefing and argument and ample time for mature consideration, he is in agreement that we should not attempt to hear and decide this case prior to the beginning of the criminal trial in early January.

  4. 
Petitioners Nebraska Press Association et al., are invited to file an amended petition for certiorari on or before December 30, 1975. Responses may be made in accord with the Court's Rules.[ Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart
