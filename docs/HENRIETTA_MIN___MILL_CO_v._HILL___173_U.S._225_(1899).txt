Opinion


United States Supreme Court
HENRIETTA MIN & MILL CO v. HILL(1899)
No. 138
Argued: Decided: February 27, 1899


 W. H. Barnes and Frank Asbury Johnson, for appellant.

 Mr. Justice BROWN.
 The facts in this case, so far as they bear upon the question in controversy, are precisely similar to the one just decided (Milling Co. v. Johnson, 19 Sup. Ct. 402), and the judgment of the supreme court of Arizona is therefore affirmed.
