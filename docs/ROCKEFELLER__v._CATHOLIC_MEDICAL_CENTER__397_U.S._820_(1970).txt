  James M. Hartman and Richard L. Epstein, for appellees.




PER CURIAM.

  The judgment appealed from does not include an order granting or denying an interlocutory or permanent injunction and is therefore not appealable to this Court under 28 U.S.C.  1253. See Goldstein v. Cox, 
396 
U.S. 471
. The judgment of the District Court is vacated and the case is remanded to that court so that it may enter a fresh decree from which timely appeal may be taken to the Court of Appeals. See Stamler v. Willis, 
393 
U.S. 407
.
  Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concurs in the result.[  Rockefeller v. Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn & Queens, Inc.
