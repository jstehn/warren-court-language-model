No. 122

 The Attorney General, for the United States.

Â 

 Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.
 Judgment in this case was rendered at the same time as that in Mason & Hanger Co. v. United States, 
260 U.S. 323
, 43 Sup. Ct. 128, 67 L. Ed. --, just decided.
 The amounts only are different. In that case it was $2,500-in this case it is $150. In both, the amounts represented premiums on bonds and depend upon the same considerations. On the authority of the Mason & Hanger Co. Case the judgment of the Court of Claims in this case is
 Affirmed.
