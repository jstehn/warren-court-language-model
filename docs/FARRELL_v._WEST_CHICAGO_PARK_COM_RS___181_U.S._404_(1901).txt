No. 201
Argued: Decided: April 29, 1901



 Messrs. George W. Wilbur and Newton A. Partridge for plaintiffs in error.
 Charles Hudson for defendants in error.

 Mr. Justice Shiras delivered the opinion of the court:
 This case originated in proceedings to create and improve an avenue or thoroughfare known as Douglas boulevard, in the town of West Chicago.
 The full history of those proceedings, contained in the statement of facts made by this court in the case of Lombard v. West Chicago Park Comrs. recently decided, 
181 U.S. 33
, ante, 507, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 507, renders it unnecessary to repeat them here. And the legal questions involved were so fully discussed in that case, and in French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. 
181 U.S. 324
, post, 625, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 625, and Wight v. Davidson, 
181 U.S. 371
, post, 616, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616, cognate cases decided at the present term of this court, that we are relieved from their further consideration.
 The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois is affirmed.
 For dissenting opinion, see Cass Farm Co. v. Detroit, 181 U. S. -, post, 645, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 645.
