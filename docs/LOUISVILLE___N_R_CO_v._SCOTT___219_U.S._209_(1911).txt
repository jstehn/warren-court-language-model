Opinion


United States Supreme Court
LOUISVILLE & N R. CO. v. SCOTT(1911)
No. 286
Argued: Decided: January 3, 1911


 Messrs. Charles H. Moorman, Joseph R. Lamar, Benjamin D. Warfield, and Henry L. Stone for plaintiff in error.
 Assistant to the Attorney General Kenyon as amicus curioe.
 No counsel for defendant in error.

 Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:
 This case was heard with No. 215, Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, just decided. [
219 U.S. 186
, 55 L. ed. --, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164.] Like that case it presents only the question of the constitutionality of the Carmack amendment of the act to regulate commerce.
 The facts are not substantially different, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals of the Commonwealth of Kentucky is affirmed upon the authority of that case.
 Affirmed.
