 Messrs. Francis Biddle, Atty. Gen., and Ernest A. Gross, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.
 Mr. John Harrington, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.

 PER CURIAM.
 Upon examination of the record, the Court concludes that the Board's findings are supported by substantial evidence. National Labor Relations Board v. Link-Belt Co.,

U.S. 584
, 61 S.Ct. 358; Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Co. v. Labor Board, 
312 
U.S. 660
, 61 S.Ct. 736. The judgment is therefore reversed with directions to enforce the Board's order in full, but with the modification proposed by the Board to conform to the decision in Republic Steel Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 311 U.S. 

[315 
U.S. 282, 283]
Â 
 7, 61 S.Ct. 77. The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS are of opinion that the order as modified should be enforced except with respect to the alleged discriminatory discharges of Warner, Jr., and Jordan, which they think are without the support of substantial evidence.
 Reversed, with directions.
