Opinion


United States Supreme Court
ROGERS v. CLARK IRON CO(1910)
No. 244
Argued: Decided: April 11, 1910


 Mr. John B. Richards for plaintiffs in error.
 Messrs. John G. Williams, Joseph B. Cotton, William R. Begg, and Frank B. Kellogg for defendants in error.

 Per Curiam:
 Writ of Error dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The case is reported below in 104 Minn. 198, 116 N. W. 739, where the facts are set forth at length. We hold that no Federal question was decided either by express terms or by necessary implication, and that the attempt to raise a Federal question was made in this court for the first time, which was too late.
