Opinion


United States Supreme Court
U S v. SHIPP(1909)

Argued: Decided: November 15, 1909


 The Chief Justice announced the judgment of the court as follows: 'You, Joseph F. Shipp, Jeremiah Gibson, Luther Williams, Nick Nolan, Henry Padgett, and William Mayse, are before this court on an attachment for contempt.
'On return to a rule to show cause, you have presented such evidence as you were advised, and been fully heard orally and on printed briefs, and, after thorough consideration, you have been found guilty. You have also been permitted severally to present petitions for rehearing, and move that leave be granted to file them, which, after consideration, have been denied.

'The grounds upon which the conclusion was reached are set forth in the opinion filed herein on Monday, May 24, 1909, and need not be repeated, nor need we dwell upon the destructive consequences of permitting the transaction complained of to pass into a precedent for unpunished contempt.

'It is considered by the court, and the judgment of the court is, that, as punishment for the contempt, you, Joseph F. 

[215 U.S. 580, 582]

The marshal of this court is charged with the execution of this judgment.'
