AMERICAN BOND & MORTGAGE COMPANY v. UNITED STATES(1931)
No. 210
Argued: December 5, 1930Decided: January 5, 1931




[282 U.S. 374, 375]
Â 
 Mr. George W. Swain, of Chicago, Ill., for American Bond & Mortgage Co. and another.
 Mr. Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.

 Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.
 The same Circuit Court of Appeals which certified questions in No. 29 ( 
282 
U.S. 367
, 51 S. Ct. 115) also certified six questions in this case. While they are differently phrased, they are in substance the same.
 Here a suit in equity was brought by the United States to restrain the proprietor of a broadcasting station from disregarding an order of the Federal Radio Commission, revoking its license, and from operating in definance of the provisions of the Radio Act (47 USCA  81 et seq.). As in the other case, the appellants admittedly failed to avail themselves of the right of appeal afforded by the Act.
 The reasons stated in No. 29 for not answering the questions therein certified apply here. The certificate is dismissed.
