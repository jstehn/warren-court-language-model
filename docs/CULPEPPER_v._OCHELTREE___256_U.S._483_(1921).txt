Opinion


United States Supreme Court
CULPEPPER v. OCHELTREE(1921)
No. 292
Argued: Decided: June 1, 1921


 Mr. Samuel Herrick, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.
 Mr. Patrick H. Loughran, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.

 Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
 This case is in all material respects like McLaren v. Fleischer, 
256 U.S. 477
, 41 Sup. Ct. 577, 65 L. Ed. --. It was decided in the same way by the state courts and was argued with that case here. Therefore the opinion in that will suffice to dispose of this.
 Judgment affirmed.
