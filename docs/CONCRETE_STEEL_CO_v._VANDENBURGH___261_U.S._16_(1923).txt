 Messrs. O. Ellery Edwards, of New York City, and Carlos P. Griffin of San Francisco, Cal., for Vandenburgh.

 Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.
 This is a review of the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, sustaining the validity of claim No. 3 of the Vandenburgh patent, just considered in the previous case of Vandenburgh v. Truscon Steel Co., 
261 U.S. 6
, 43 Sup. Ct. 331, 67 L. Ed. -- and awarding $15,000 for profits to Vandenburgh for defendant's infringement. The two cases cannot be distinguished. We must therefore reverse 

[261 U.S. 16, 17]
Â 
 the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, and direct the dismissal of the bill.
 Reversed.
