United States Supreme Court
C A WEED & CO. v. LOCKWOOD(1921)
No. 407
Argued: Decided: February 28, 1921


 Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.
 An indictment having been returned against the appellant in the court below for violating the fourth section of the Lever Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann.
