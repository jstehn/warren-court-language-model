 IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED AS FOLLOWS:

  1. That the extension of the boundary southerly from the point where the line forming the boundary between Texas and Louisiana southerly from the Arkansas boundary, intersects the geographical middle of the Sabine River (Latitude 31ø59' 56.225"; North, Longitude 94ø02'33.105" West, said point being taken from the United States Geological Survey Quadrangle Center, Tex.-La. 1958 Edition) to the mid-point between the gulfward extension of the Sabine Pass jetties Latitude 29ø38'37.329" North, Longitude 93ø49'30.940" West hereby is established.

Said boundary commences at Latitude 31ø59'56.225" North and Longitude 94ø02'33.105" West, thence proceeding in a southerly direction along the Sabine River using the federal line as shown for the boundary on the United States Geological Survey Quadrangle Center, Tex.-La., 1958 Edition (photorevised 1969) and signed by Hatley N. Harrison, Jr., for Louisiana on February 20, 1974, and by H. H. Forbes, Jr., for Texas on February 20, 1974, which is in evidence in this case as Texas Exhibit AAA-1.

Louisiana does not hold title to or interest in any island in the west half of the Sabine River. The United States and Texas do not hold title to or interest in any island in the east half of the Sabine River.

5. That the costs be taxed to the parties in accordance with their contribution to the fund established by the Special Master, and that no costs be taxed for the services of the Special Master.
