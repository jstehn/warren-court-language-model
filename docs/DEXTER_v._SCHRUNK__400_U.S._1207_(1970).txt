Opinion


United States Supreme Court
DEXTER v. SCHRUNK(1970)

Argued: Decided: August 29, 1970


  Application for a restraining order.


 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, Circuit Justice.
  Under Dombrowski Pfister, 
380 
U.S. 479
, applicants make out a strong case for federal protection of their First Amendment rights. But Dombrowski, a five-to-two decision decided in 1965, is up for reexamination in cases set for reargument this fall. If the present case were before the Conference, I am confident it would be held pending the cases to be reargued. Hence, as Circuit Justice, I do not feel warranted in taking action contrary to what I feel the Conference would do. Accordingly, I deny the restraining order requested.[  Dexter v. Schrunk
