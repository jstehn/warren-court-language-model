 This writ of error has been sued out to review a judgment of the court of appeals of Kentucky which affirmed the conviction of Thomas Malone, the plaintiff in error, for selling pooled tobacco without the consent of the agents of the pool, contrary to  3941a of the Kentucky statutes. 141 Ky. 570, 133 S. W. 235.
 The case is the same in all material respects as that of Collins v. Kentucky, decided this day [
